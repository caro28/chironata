          </ab>
          <p>I. Cato the elder, speaking to some persons who were <lb/>
            praising a man of reckless daring and audacity in war, <lb/>
            observed that there is a difference between a man's setting <lb/>
            a high value on courage, and setting a low value on his <lb/>
            own life-and rightly. For a daring soldier in the army <lb/>
            of Antigonus, but of broken and ill health, being asked by <lb/>
            the king the reason of his paleness, confessed that he was <lb/>
            suffering from some secret disorder. When then the king, <lb/>
            anxious for him, charged his physicians to use the greatest <lb/>
            care in their treatment, if a cure were possible, at length <lb/>
            this brave fellow, being restored to health, was no longer <lb/>
            fond of peril and furious in battle, so that Antigonus <lb/>
            reproved him, and expressed surprise at the change. The <lb/>
            man made no secret of his reason, but answered: "My, <lb/>
            king, you have made me less warlike by freeing me from <lb/>
            those miseries on account of which I used to hold my life <lb/>
            cheap." And the Sybarite seems to have spoken to the same <lb/>
            effect about the Spartans, when he said that " they do no <lb/>
            great thing by dying in the wars in order to escape from <lb/>
            such labours and such a mode of life as theirs." However, <lb/>
            no wonder if the Sybarites, effete with luxurious de­ <lb/>
            bauchery, thought men mad who despised death for love <lb/>
            of honour and noble emulation; whereas the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians were enabled by their valour both to live and to <lb/>
            die with pleasure, as the elegy shows, which runs thus: <lb/>
            "'Twas not that life or death itself was good. <lb/>
            That these heroic spirits shed their blood: <lb/>
            This was their aim, and this their latest cry, <lb/>
            'Let us preserve our honour, live or die.' " <note type="footnote">VOL. D. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear>St</unclear> </note> <pb n="2"/>
             </p>
          <p>For neither is avoidance of death blameable, if a man <lb/>
            does not cling to his life from dishonourable motives; nor <lb/>
            is exposure to peril honourable, if it springs from careless­ <lb/>
            ness of life. For this reason Homer always brings the <lb/>
            most daring and warlike heroes into battle well and <lb/>
            beautifully armed, and the Greek lawgivers punish the <lb/>
            man who throws away his shield, but not him who throws <lb/>
            away his sword or spear, showing that it is each man's duty <lb/>
            to take more care that he does not receive hurt himself, <lb/>
            than to hurt the enemy, especially if he be the chief of an <lb/>
            army or city.</p>
          <p>II. For if, as Iphikrates defined it, the light troops <lb/>
            resemble the hands, the cavalry the feet, the main body <lb/>
            the breast and trunk, and the general the head, then it <lb/>
            would appear that he, if he runs into danger and shows <lb/>
            personal daring, risks not only his own life, but that of all <lb/>
            those whose safety depends upon him; and vice versâ. <lb/>
            Wherefore Kallikratidas, although otherwise a great man, <lb/>
            yet did not make a good answer to the soothsayer; for <lb/>
            when he begged him to beware of death, which was <lb/>
            presaged by the sacrifices, he replied that Sparta had more <lb/>
            men besides himself. No doubt, in fighting either by sea <lb/>
            or land - Kallikratidas only counted for one, but as a <lb/>
            general, he combined in his own person the strength of <lb/>
            all the rest, so that he by whose death so many perished, <lb/>
            was indeed more than one. A better answer was that of <lb/>
            old Antigonus, who, as he was about to begin a sea-fight <lb/>
            off Andros, some one having said that the enemy's fleet <lb/>
            was the more numerous, asked, " And for how many do <lb/>
            you count me ? "-setting a high value, as is due, upon a <lb/>
            skilful and brave leader, whose first duty is to keep safe <lb/>
            him who preserves all the rest.</p>
          <p>So Timotheus said well, when Chares was displaying <lb/>
            to the Athenians the wounds on his body, and his shield <lb/>
            pierced by a dart. "Now I," said he, " when I was <lb/>
            besieging Samoa, was quite ashamed if an arrow fell near <lb/>
            me, thinking that I was exposing myself more boyishly <lb/>
            than was fitting for the general and leader of so im­ <lb/>
            portant a force." In cases where the personal risk of the <note type="footnote"> * Kallikratidas, the Lacedæmonian admiral, was defeated and slain <lb/>
            by the Athenians at the battle of Arginusæ, B.C. 406. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            general is of great moment to his army, then he must <lb/>
            fight and expose himself without stint, and disregard <lb/>
            those who say that a general should die of old age, or at <lb/>
            any rate, when an old man. But where the gain is small <lb/>
            in case of success, while failure ruins everything, no one <lb/>
            demands that the work of the common soldier be performed <lb/>
            at the risk of the general's life.</p>
          <p>These prefatory remarks occurred to me in writing the <lb/>
            Lives of Pelopidas and Marcellus, great men who fell in <lb/>
            a manner scarce worthy of themselves: for being both <lb/>
            of them most stout in battle, and having each illustrated <lb/>
            his country by splendid campaigns, against, too, the most <lb/>
            terrible antagonists-the one, as we read, having routed <lb/>
            Hannibal, who before was invincible, and the other having <lb/>
            in a pitched battle conquered the Lacedæmonians, the <lb/>
            ruling state by sea and land-yet they without any con­ <lb/>
            sideration endangered themselves and flung away their <lb/>
            lives just at the time when there was special need for such <lb/>
            men to live and command. And on this account I have <lb/>
            drawn a parallel between their lives, tracing out the points <lb/>
            of resemblance between them.</p>
          <p>III. The family of Pelopidas, the son of Hippokles, was <lb/>
            an honourable one at Thebes, as likewise was that of <lb/>
            Epameinondas. Bred in great affluence, and having early <lb/>
            succeeded to a splendid inheritance, he showed eagerness <lb/>
            to relieve the deserving poor, that he might prove that he <lb/>
            had become the master, not the servant of his riches. In <lb/>
            most cases, Aristotle observes, men either do not use their <lb/>
            wealth through narrow-mindedness, or else abuse it through <lb/>
            extravagance, and the one class are always the slaves of <lb/>
            their pleasures, the other of their gains.</p>
          <p>Now, while all other persons gratefully made use of <lb/>
            Pelopidas's liberality and kindness, Epameinondas alone <lb/>
            could not be induced to share his wealth; he thereupon <lb/>
            shared the other's poverty, priding himself on simplicity <lb/>
            of dress and plainness of food, endurance of fatigue, and <lb/>
            thoroughness in the performance of military service; like <lb/>
            Kapaneus, in Euripides, who " had plenty of wealth, but <lb/>
            was far from proud on account of his wealth," for he felt <lb/>
            ashamed to be seen using more bodily luxuries than the <lb/>
            poorest Theban citizen. Epameinondas, whose poverty <note type="footnote">B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            was hereditary, made it lighter and more easily borne <lb/>
            by the practice of philosophy, and by choosing from the <lb/>
            beginning a single life; while Pelopidas made a brilliant <lb/>
            marriage and had children born to him, yet, in spite of this, <lb/>
            diminished his fortune by disregard of money-making and <lb/>
            by giving up all his time to the service of his country. <lb/>
            And when his friends blamed him, and said that he was <lb/>
            treating lightly a necessary of life, the possession of money, <lb/>
            "Necessary, indeed," he answered, " for Nikodemus here," <lb/>
            pointing to a man who was a cripple and blind.</p>
          <p>IV. They were both alike in nobleness of spirit, save <lb/>
            that Pelopidas took more pleasure in bodily exercise, and <lb/>
            Epameinondas in learning, and that the one in his leisure <lb/>
            time frequented the palæstra and the hunting field, while <lb/>
            the other would listen to and discuss philosophy. And <lb/>
            though they have both many titles to glory, yet judicious <lb/>
            persons think nothing so much to their credit as that their <lb/>
            friendship should have remained from beginning to end <lb/>
            unimpaired through so many important crises, campaigns, <lb/>
            and administrations. For any one who considers the <lb/>
            administrations of Aristeides and Themistokles, and Kimon <lb/>
            and Perikles, and Nikias and Alkibiades, how full they <lb/>
            were of mutual enmity, distrust, and jealousy, and then <lb/>
            contrasts them with the kindness and respect shown by <lb/>
            Pelopidas to Epameinondas, will pronounce with truth <lb/>
            these men to have really been colleagues in government <lb/>
            and war rather than those who were constantly strug­ <lb/>
            gling to get the better of one another instead of the <lb/>
            enemy. The true cause of this was their virtue, guided <lb/>
            by which they sought no glory or gain for themselves from <lb/>
            their deeds, from which envious rivalry always results, but <lb/>
            both, inflamed by a noble desire to see their country reach <lb/>
            its climax of power and renown in their own time, used <lb/>
            one another's successes for this purpose as if they were their <lb/>
            own. Not but what most people think that their closest <lb/>
            friendship arose from the campaign of Mantinea, which <lb/>
            they made with a contingent sent from Thebes to serve <lb/>
            with the Lacedæmonians, who were then their friends and <lb/>
            allies. Stationed together in the ranks,. and fighting <note type="footnote"> * No one seems able to identify this battle. See Grote's History, <lb/>
            Part II., ch. lxxvii., note, a. v. Epameinondaa. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            against the Arcadians, when the wing cf the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            army in which they were gave way, and many took to <lb/>
            flight, they closed up together and beat off their assailants. <lb/>
            Pelopidas, having received seven wounds in front, fell <lb/>
            down upon a heap of slain, friends and enemies together; <lb/>
            but Epameinondas, though he thought him desperately. <lb/>
            hurt, ran forward and stood in defence of his body and <lb/>
            arms, risking his life alone against a multitude, determined <lb/>
            to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. He too <lb/>
            was in evil plight, with a spear wound in the breast, and a <lb/>
            sword-cut on the arm, when Agesipolis, the Spartan king, <lb/>
            came to the rescue from the other wing, and most unex­ <lb/>
            pectedly saved the lives of both.</p>
          <p>V. After this, the Spartans behaved towards Thebes <lb/>
            outwardly as friends and allies, but really viewed with <lb/>
            suspicion the spirit and strength of that state. They espe­ <lb/>
            cially disliked the club presided over by Ismenias and <lb/>
            Androkleides, of which Pelopidas was a member, as being <lb/>
            of democratic and revolutionary principles. Consequently <lb/>
            Archias and Leontidas t and Philippus, men of the aristo­ <lb/>
            cratic party, wealthy and unscrupulous, persuaded Phœ­ <lb/>
            bidas, a Laconian who was passing through the town with <lb/>
            an armed force, to seize the Kadmeia t by surprise, and, <lb/>
            banishing the party that opposed them, establish an aristo­ <lb/>
            cratic oligarchy which would be subservient to Sparta.</p>
          <p>He was persuaded to do this, and attacked the un­ <lb/>
            suspecting Thebans during the feast of Thesmophoria. <lb/>
            When he gained possession of the height, Ismenias was <lb/>
            seized and conveyed to Lacedæmon, and there not long <lb/>
            afterwards made away with. Pelopidas, Pherenikus, and <lb/>
            Androkleides, with many others, went into exile and were <lb/>
            outlawed by proclamation. Epameinondas stayed at home <lb/>
            disregarded, not being thought to be a man of action, <lb/>
            because of his philosophical habits, nor a man of any <lb/>
            power, because of his poverty.</p>
          <p>VI. When the Lacedæmonians removed Phoebidas from <lb/>
            his command and fined him a hundred thousand drachmas, <note type="footnote"> * See Life of Titus Flamininus, p. 175, note. </note><note type="footnote"> t More usually spelt Leontiades.' </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Kadmeia, the Acropolis of Thebes, a fortress on a lofty rock over­ <lb/>
            hangiug the town. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            but nevertheless held the Kadmeia with a garrison, all <lb/>
            the other Greeks wondered at their inconsistency, in <lb/>
            punishing the doer but approving of the deed; but the <lb/>
            Thebans, who had lost their old constitution and were now <lb/>
            held in bondage by the party of Archias and Leontidas, <lb/>
            had lost all hope of release from their tyrants, who they <lb/>
            perceived were merely acting as a guard to the Spartan <lb/>
            supremacy in Greece, and therefore could not be put a stop <lb/>
            to, unless their enterprise by sea and land could also be <lb/>
            checked. However, Leontidas and his party, learning that <lb/>
            the exiles were living at Athens, and were popular with <lb/>
            the people there, and respected by the upper classes, began <lb/>
            to plot against them, and by sending thither men who <lb/>
            were unknown to the exiles, they killed Androkleides by <lb/>
            stratagem, but failed with the others. There came also <lb/>
            despatches from Lacedæmon to the Athenians, ordering <lb/>
            them not to take them in nor to meddle in the matter, but <lb/>
            to banish the exiles, on the ground that they had been <lb/>
            proclaimed to be public enemies by their allies. But the <lb/>
            Athenians, who besides their natural and innate kindness <lb/>
            were returning a debt of gratitude to the Thebans, who <lb/>
            had been main instruments in the re-establishment of their <lb/>
            government, and had decreed that if an Athenian should <lb/>
            march in arms against the tyrants through Bœotia, no <lb/>
            Boeotian should see or hear him, did the Theban exiles no <lb/>
            harm.</p>
          <p>VII. Now Pelopidas, although one of the youngest of <lb/>
            the exiles, yet used to encourage each of them separately, <lb/>
            and would make speeches to them all, pointing out that it <lb/>
            was both dishonourable and wicked for them to endure to <lb/>
            see their country enslaved and garrisoned by foreigners, <lb/>
            and, caring only to save their own lives, to shelter them­ <lb/>
            selves behind decrees of the Athenians, and to pay servile <lb/>
            court to the orators who had influence with the people. <lb/>
            Rather was it, he urged, their duty to run the greatest <lb/>
            risk, taking pattern by the courage and patriotism of <lb/>
            Thrasybulus, so that, as he once, starting from Thebes, <lb/>
            drove out the thirty tyrants from Athens, they also in <lb/>
            their turn, starting from Athens, might set Thebes free. <lb/>
            When then he prevailed with these arguments, they sent <lb/>
            secretly to Thebes to communicate their determination to <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            such of their friends as were left there. They agreed, <lb/>
            and Charon, who was the leading man among them, offered <lb/>
            his house for their reception, and Phillidas proceeded to <lb/>
            act as secretary to the polemarchs, Archias and Philippus. <lb/>
            Epameinondas had long been instilling feelings of patriot­ <lb/>
            ism into the youth of Thebes; for in the gymnasia he <lb/>
            would bid them lay hold of the Lacedæmonians and wrestle <lb/>
            with them, and then seeing them pluming themselves on <lb/>
            their success, he would upbraid them, telling them that <lb/>
            they ought rather to feel ashamed at being, through their <lb/>
            own cowardice, in bondage to men whom they so greatly <lb/>
            excelled in strength.</p>
          <p>VIII. When a day was fixed on for the attempt, the <lb/>
            exiles determined that Pherenikus, with the main body, <lb/>
            should remain in the Thriasian * plain, while a few of the <lb/>
            youngest men ran the risk of entering the city; and if <lb/>
            anything were to befall these men, the others would take <lb/>
            care that neither their parents nor their children should <lb/>
            want for necessaries. First Pelopidas volunteered for <lb/>
            the attempt, then Mellon and Damokleides and Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus, men of the first families, faithful friends to one <lb/>
            another, and ever rivals in glory and bravery. Having <lb/>
            made up a party of twelve in all, and embraced those <lb/>
            who were to stay, and sent a messenger before them to <lb/>
            Charon, they set out, dressed in short cloaks, with hounds <lb/>
            and carrying stakes for hunting nets, so that no one whom <lb/>
            they met on the road might suspect them, but that they <lb/>
            might seem to be merely ranging about the country and <lb/>
            hunting. When their messenger reached Charon, and told <lb/>
            him that they were on their way, Charon did not, even <lb/>
            now that the danger was close to him, falter in his deter­ <lb/>
            mination, but acted like an honourable man, and received <lb/>
            them into his house. But one Hipposthenides, not a bad <lb/>
            man, but one who loved his country and favoured the <lb/>
            exiles, yet proved wanting in that audacity which this <lb/>
            emergency, a hazardous one indeed, and the attempt they <lb/>
            had in hand, required.</p>
          <p>Apparently the importance of the issue with which he <lb/>
            was dealing turned him dizzy; he with difficulty grasped <lb/>
            the idea that, trusting in the desperate hopes of exiles, these <note type="footnote"> * In Attics. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            men were in some fashion about to attempt to overthrow <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian government in Thebes, and the power <lb/>
            of Sparta. He went quietly home, and sent one of hi a <lb/>
            friends to Mellon and Pelopidas, bidding them put off <lb/>
            their design for the present, to go back to Athens, and <lb/>
            await a better opportunity. Chlidon was the name of <lb/>
            the messenger, and he hurriedly went to his own house, <lb/>
            and, leading out his horse, asked for his bridle. His wife <lb/>
            was at her wit's end, as she had it not to give him, but she <lb/>
            said that she had lent it to a neighbour. Hereupon there <lb/>
            was a quarrel, and words of ill omen were used, for his <lb/>
            wife said that she wished it might be a bad journey for <lb/>
            him, and for those that sent him; so that Chlidon, having <lb/>
            wasted a great part of the day in this squabble, and also <lb/>
            drawing a bad augury from what had happened, gave up <lb/>
            his journey altogether, and betook himself to something <lb/>
            else. So near was this greatest and most glorious of his <lb/>
            adventures of missing its opportunity at its very outset.</p>
          <p>IX. Now Pelopidas and his party changed their clothes <lb/>
            with country people, and separating, came into the city <lb/>
            by different ways while it was still daylight. There was <lb/>
            a strong wind, and the weather was snowy, so that they <lb/>
            were the less noticed, as most people had betaken them­ <lb/>
            selves to their houses on account of the storm ; but those <lb/>
            who were in the plot met them as they entered, and <lb/>
            brought them to Charon's house. With the exiles, they <lb/>
            amounted to forty-eight in all.</p>
          <p>As to their oppressors, Phillidas the secretary, who had <lb/>
            been working with the exiles and knew all their plans, <lb/>
            having long before invited Archias and his friends to a <lb/>
            wine party to meet certain courtesans, intended to <lb/>
            endeavour to hand them over to their assailants in as <lb/>
            enervated and intoxicated a condition as possible. How­ <lb/>
            ever before they were very far gone in liquor a rumour <lb/>
            was brought to their ears, which, although true, was <lb/>
            without confirmation and very vague, to the effect that <lb/>
            the exiles were concealed in the city. Though Phillidas <lb/>
            endeavoured to change the subject, still Archias sent one <lb/>
            of his servants to Charon, ordering him to come in­ <lb/>
            stantly. Now it was evening, and Pelopidas and his <lb/>
            party were preparing themselves, in the house, and <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            had already got their corslets on, and had girt on their <lb/>
            swords. Suddenly, a knock was heard at the door. One <lb/>
            of them ran out, and hearing the servant say that Charon <lb/>
            had been sent for by the polemarchs, he in great trepida­ <lb/>
            tion brought the news to the rest. At once it occurred to <lb/>
            all that the plot had been betrayed, and that they all <lb/>
            were lost, without even having done anything worthy of <lb/>
            their courage. Yet they agreed that Charon should <lb/>
            comply with the summons and that he should un­ <lb/>
            suspiciously present himself before the Spartan chiefs. <lb/>
            He was a man of courage, and slow to lose heart, but now <lb/>
            he was panic-stricken and terrified lest when so many <lb/>
            brave citizens lost their lives, some suspicion of treachery <lb/>
            might rest on himself. So, just when he was going, he <lb/>
            brought his son from the women's apartments, a boy still, <lb/>
            but in beauty and strength surpassing all of his own age, <lb/>
            and handed him over to Pelopidas's party, bidding them <lb/>
            treat him as an enemy and show no mercy, if they should <lb/>
            find him guilty of any deceit or treachery. Many of them <lb/>
            shed tears at the feeling shown by Charon, and his noble <lb/>
            spirit, and all felt shame, that he should think any of them <lb/>
            so base and so affected by their present danger, as to <lb/>
            suspect him or even to blame him, and they begged him <lb/>
            not to mix up his son with them, but put him out of the <lb/>
            way of the coming stroke, that he might be saved and <lb/>
            escape from the tyrants, and some day return and avenge <lb/>
            his father and his friends. But Charon refused to take <lb/>
            away his son, for what life, he asked, or what place of <lb/>
            safety could be more honourable to him than an easy death <lb/>
            with his father and so many friends ? After praying and <lb/>
            embracing them all, and bidding them be of good cheer, <lb/>
            he went away, taking great pains to adopt a look and tone <lb/>
            of voice as different as possible to that of a conspirator.</p>
          <p>X. When he came to the door, Archias and Philippus <lb/>
            met him and said, " Charon, I have heard that some <lb/>
            people have come here, and are concealed in the city, and <lb/>
            that some of the citizens are in league with them." <lb/>
            Charon was at first disconcerted, but then enquired who <lb/>
            these persons might be, and who they were that gave them <lb/>
            shelter. Seeing then that Archias knew nothing for <lb/>
            certain, he perceived that the news did not come from <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            any one who knew the truth. “ Take care," said he <lb/>
            “that this be not a mere idle rumour that is alarming <lb/>
            you. However, I will make due enquiries; for we ought <lb/>
            not to disregard anything." Phillidas, who was present, <lb/>
            expressed his approval of this, and carrying Archias back <lb/>
            again plied him with liquor, prolonging his debauch by <lb/>
            holding out the expectation of the women.</p>
          <p>Now when Charon returned to his house, he found the <lb/>
            conspirators there prepared to fight, not expecting to <lb/>
            survive or to win the day, but to die gloriously and kill <lb/>
            as many of their enemies as possible. He told Pelopidas's <lb/>
            party the truth, and made up some story about Archias <lb/>
            to satisfy the others. This storm was just blown over <lb/>
            when Fortune sent a second upon them. A messenger <lb/>
            came from Athens, from Archias the hierophant * to his <lb/>
            namesake Archias the Spartan, whose guest and friend <lb/>
            he was, bearing a letter which contained no vague and <lb/>
            conjectural suspicion, but a detailed account of all that <lb/>
            was being done, as was afterwards discovered. Now the <lb/>
            messenger, when brought before Archias who was drunk, <lb/>
            gave him the letter, and said, "He who sent you this <lb/>
            letter bade you read it instantly, for he said it was <lb/>
            written about most serious matters." Archias laughing, <lb/>
            said, " Serious matters to-morrow." He took the letter <lb/>
            and placed it under the pillow on which he rested, and <lb/>
            again listened to Phillidas about what they were talking <lb/>
            of before. This story, handed down in the form of a <lb/>
            proverb, is current among the Greeks even now.</p>
          <p>XI. As the hour for the attempt seemed now to have <lb/>
            arrived, they sallied forth, in two bodies: the one, under <lb/>
            Pelopidas and Damokleides, to attack Leontidas and <lb/>
            Hypates, who lived near one another, while the other, <lb/>
            under Charon and Mellon, went to Archias and Philippus, <lb/>
            with women a gowns over their steel corslets, and their <lb/>
            faces concealed by thick wreaths of fir and pine wood; and <lb/>
            so when first they entered the door of the dining-room <lb/>
            they caused great applause and disturbance, as the guests <lb/>
            imagined that the long-expected ladies had at length <lb/>
            come. TLey looked carefully round the party, and having <lb/>
            ascertained who each of the guests were, they drew their <note type="footnote"> * The chief priest who prt aided at the Eleusinian mystories. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            swords, and made for Archias and Philippus. When they <lb/>
            thus betrayed themselves, Phillidas persuaded some few <lb/>
            of the guests to remain quiet, but the rest, who rose and <lb/>
            tried to assist the polemarchs, were easily disposed of on <lb/>
            account of their drunken condition.</p>
          <p>The task of Pelopidas and his party was a harder one; <lb/>
            for they went to attack Leontidas, a sober and brave man, <lb/>
            and, finding his house shut up, for he was already asleep, <lb/>
            they knocked for some time without rousing any one. At <lb/>
            length the servant heard them and came and drew back <lb/>
            the bolt of the door; then, as soon as the leaves of the <lb/>
            door yielded they burst in in a body, and upsetting the <lb/>
            servant made for the bedchamber. Leontidas, guessing <lb/>
            from the noise and confusion what was going on, started <lb/>
            up and seized his dagger, but he forgot to put out the <lb/>
            light, and make the men fall upon each other in the dark­ <lb/>
            ness. In full view of them, in a blaze of light, he met <lb/>
            them at his chamber door, and with a blow of his dagger <lb/>
            struck down Kephisodorus, the first man who entered. <lb/>
            As he fell dead Leontidas grappled with the next, <lb/>
            Pelopidas. The struggle was a fierce one and rendered <lb/>
            difficult by the narrow passage and the corpse of Kephiso­ <lb/>
            dorus lying in it, but at length Pelopidas gained the <lb/>
            upper hand, and having despatched him, immediately went <lb/>
            with his party to attack Hypates. And in the same way <lb/>
            they broke into his house, but he heard them sooner, and <lb/>
            fled away to the neighbours, but was pursued and slain.</p>
          <p>XII. Having accomplished this, and joined Mellon's <lb/>
            party, they sent word to the remaining exiles in Attica, <lb/>
            and called together the citizens to complete their deliver­ <lb/>
            ance, and as they came, gave them arms, taking down the <lb/>
            trophies which hung in the public colonnades, and breaking <lb/>
            into the workshops of spear-makers and sword-cutlers. <lb/>
            And Epameinondas and Gorgidas, with their party, came <lb/>
            to help them, armed; for they had collected together no <lb/>
            small number of the younger men and the strongest of <lb/>
            the elder ones. By this time the whole city was roused, <lb/>
            and there was great confusion, lights flitting about, and <lb/>
            people running to one another's houses, but the people <lb/>
            had not yet assembled, but being alarmed at what had <lb/>
            happened, and knowing nothing for certain, they waited <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            for daylight. And here the generals of the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            garrison seem to have missed an opportunity in not at once <lb/>
            sallying out and attacking them, for the garrison itself <lb/>
            consisted of 1500 men, and many people kept running <lb/>
            to them for refuge from the city; however, alarmed at <lb/>
            the shouts and fires and mass of people assembling from <lb/>
            all parts, they remained quiet, holding the Kadmeia only. <lb/>
            At daybreak arrived the exiles from Attica, fully armed, <lb/>
            and the public assembly met. Epameinondas and <lb/>
            Gorgidas led forward the band of Pelopidas, surrounded <lb/>
            by the priests, who crowned them with wreaths, and <lb/>
            called upon the citizens to fight for their country and <lb/>
            their gods. The whole assembly, with shouts and <lb/>
            applause, rose at the sight, and received them as their <lb/>
            benefactors and saviours.</p>
          <p>XIII. After this, Pelopidas, who was chosen Bœotarch, * <lb/>
            with Mellon and Charon as colleagues, at once blockaded <lb/>
            the citadel, and made assaults upon it on all sides, being <lb/>
            eager to drive out the Lacedæmonians and recover the <lb/>
            Kadmeia before an army should come upon them from <lb/>
            Sparta. And so little time had he to spare, that the <lb/>
            garrison, when going home after their capitulation, met at <lb/>
            Megara Kleombrotus, marching with a great force against <lb/>
            Thebes. Of the three men who had been governors of <lb/>
            Thebes, the Spartans condemned two, Herippidas and <lb/>
            Arkissus, to death, and the third, Lysanorides, was heavily <lb/>
            fined and banished.</p>
          <p>This adventure was called by the Greeks the " sister " of <lb/>
            that of Thrasybulus, as it resembled it in the bravery and <lb/>
            personal risk of its chief actors, and was, like the other, <lb/>
            favoured by fortune. It is difficult to mention any other <lb/>
            persons, who with fewer numbers and scantier means than <lb/>
            these, conquered men more numerous and powerful than <lb/>
            themselves, by sheer daring and ability, or who conferred <lb/>
            greater blessings on their own countries; and that which <lb/>
            made this more remarkable was the change which it <lb/>
            effected. The war which destroyed the prestige of Sparta, <lb/>
            and put an end to her empire by sea and land, began in <note type="footnote"> * The office of Bœotarch is described at length in Smith's ‘ Dictionary <lb/>
            of Antiquities.' They seem properly to have been the military leaders <lb/>
            of the canfederacy of the whole of the cities of Bœotia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            that night, in which Pelopidas, without having made <lb/>
            himself master of any fort, stronghold, or- citadel, but <lb/>
            merely coming to a private house with eleven others, <lb/>
            loosed and broke to pieces, if we may use a true metaphor, <lb/>
            the chains of Lacedæmonian supremacy, which seemed <lb/>
            fixed and immovable.</p>
          <p>XIV. Now when a great Lacedæmonian army invaded <lb/>
            Bœotia, the Athenians manifested great alarm. They <lb/>
            repudiated their alliance with the Thebans, and impeached <lb/>
            those who had shown Boeotian sympathies; some of these <lb/>
            men were put to death, others fined and banished. The <lb/>
            case of the Thebans seemed desperate, as no one offered <lb/>
            to help them; but Pelopidas, who with Gorgidas was <lb/>
            Bceotarch, contrived to alienate the Athenians from Sparta <lb/>
            by the following plot. Sphodrias, a Spartan, of great <lb/>
            renown in the wars, but somewhat flighty and prone to <lb/>
            wild enterprises and reckless ambition, had been left <lb/>
            near Thespiæ with an army, to receive and assist those <lb/>
            Thebans * who were now sent into exile because they <lb/>
            favoured the Lacedæmonians. Pelopidas sent secretly to <lb/>
            this man a merchant, a friend of his own, who gave him <lb/>
            a bribe, and also made proposals which fascinated him <lb/>
            more than the money, that he should attempt some enter­ <lb/>
            prise on a great scale, and surprise Peiræus by a sudden <lb/>
            attack when the Athenians were off their guard: for the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians would be better pleased with the capture <lb/>
            of Athens than with anything else, and the Thebans <lb/>
            would not assist them, for they were at variance with them <lb/>
            and regarded them as traitors. At length Sphodrias was <lb/>
            prevailed upon to agree to this, and, with his soldiery, <lb/>
            invaded Attica by night. He got as far as Eleusis, but <lb/>
            there the soldiers lost heart, and the attempt was detected. <lb/>
            So, having involved the Spartans in a war of no slight <lb/>
            importance, he retired to Thespiæ.</p>
          <p>XV. Upon this the Athenians again most eagerly allied <lb/>
            themselves with the Thebans, and, aspiring to supremacy <lb/>
            at sea, sent embassies round to the other maritime states, <note type="footnote"> * This was the case in all Greek towns, namely, there were two <lb/>
            parties, aristocratic and democratic. The democracy being now in the <lb/>
            ascendant in Thebes, the party which favoured the Spartans, the most <lb/>
            aristocratic state in Greece, had gone into exile. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            and brought over to their own side those who were willing <lb/>
            to revolt from the Spartans. Meanwhile the Thebans, <lb/>
            alone in their country of Bœotia, constantly skirmishing <lb/>
            with the Lacedæmonians, and not fighting any great <lb/>
            battles with them, but organising themselves with the <lb/>
            greatest care and discipline, began to pluck up spirit, <lb/>
            gaining skill from practice, and becoming confident from <lb/>
            the result of these encounters. This was why they say <lb/>
            that Antalkidas the Spartan, when King Agesilaus was <lb/>
            being carried home wounded from Boeotia, said to him, <lb/>
            “ Indeed, you are receiving nice lessons from the Thebans, <lb/>
            now that you have taught them how to fight against <lb/>
            their will." But their real teacher was not Agesilaus, <lb/>
            but those who, seizing fit opportunities, and with due <lb/>
            management, skilfully used to let them loose upon their <lb/>
            enemies, as men train young mastiffs, and then when <lb/>
            they had tasted victory and self-confidence brought them <lb/>
            safely back. Of these leaders Pelopidas received the chief <lb/>
            credit. From the year in which he was first elected general <lb/>
            they never ceased to re-elect him, and he was always either <lb/>
            in command of the Sacred Band or most commonly acting <lb/>
            as Bœotarch until his death. There took place also about <lb/>
            Platæa and Thespiæ defeats and routs of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, in which Phœbidas, who seized the Kadmeia, <lb/>
            perished; and Pelopidas routed a number of them near <lb/>
            Tanagra, and slew Panthoides the governor. Still, <lb/>
            although these skirmishes raised the spirits and confi­ <lb/>
            dence of the victors, yet they did not cast down the pride <lb/>
            of the vanquished ; for they were not regular battles, but <lb/>
            the Thebans won their successes by well-timed charges and <lb/>
            harassing the enemy by alternate retreat and advance.</p>
          <p>However, the affair at Tegyra, which in a manner was <lb/>
            preliminary to that at Leuktra, won Pelopidas a great <lb/>
            reputation; for there was no question of any other general <lb/>
            having assisted in the design of the battle, nor of the <lb/>
            enemy being thoroughly routed. The city of Orchomenus <lb/>
            had taken the Spartan side, and had received two moras * <lb/>
            of Spartan troops for its protection. He always had his <lb/>
            eye upon this place, and watched his opportunity. Hearing <lb/>
            that the garrison had made an expedition into Lokris, he <note type="footnote"> * For the number of men in a “ mora," see p. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            marched, hoping to catch Orchomenus defenceless, taking <lb/>
            with him the Sacred Band and a few cavalry. When he <lb/>
            came to the city he found that the garrison had been <lb/>
            relieved by fresh troops from Sparta, and so he led off his <lb/>
            men homewards through Tegyra, the only way that he <lb/>
            could, by a circuitous route at the foot of the mountains; <lb/>
            for the river Melas, which from its very source spreads into <lb/>
            morasses and quagmires, made the direct way impassable.</p>
          <p>Near the marshes stands a temple of Apollo of Tegyra <lb/>
            and an oracle, which is now forsaken; it has not been <lb/>
            long so, but flourished up to the Persian War, when <lb/>
            Echekrates was priest. There the myths say that the <lb/>
            god was born; and the neighbouring mountain is called <lb/>
            Delos, and there the overflowings of the river Melas cease, <lb/>
            while behind the temple there flow two springs remark­ <lb/>
            able for the sweetness, coldness, and volume of their <lb/>
            waters, which we up to this day call, the one " The Palm," <lb/>
            and the other " The Olive," as though the goddess had <lb/>
            not been delivered between two trees, but two fountains. <lb/>
            Indeed, close by is the Ptoüm, whence they say that she <lb/>
            was driven in terror by the sudden apparition of a wild <lb/>
            boar, and with regard to the legends of Tityos and Pytho, <lb/>
            the localities are in like manner associated with the <lb/>
            birth of the god. I omit the greater part of these proofs, <lb/>
            for our ancestral religion tells us that this god is not to <lb/>
            be ranked among those divinities who were born as men, <lb/>
            like Herakles and Dionysus, and by their merits were <lb/>
            translated from this earthly and suffering body, but he <lb/>
            is one of the eternal ones who know no birth, if one may <lb/>
            form any conjecture upon such matters from the writings <lb/>
            of our wisest and most ancient writers.</p>
          <p>XVII. At Tegyra, then, Pelopidas and the Thebans <lb/>
            retiring from Orchomenus met the Lacedæmonians march­ <lb/>
            ing back from Lokris, in the opposite direction. When <lb/>
            they were first descried coming out from the narrow gorges <lb/>
            of the hills, some one ran to Pelopidas, and cried out, <lb/>
            “ We have fallen into the midst of the enemy!" “ Why <lb/>
            so," asked he, more than they into the midst of us ? " He <lb/>
            at once ordered his cavalry to the front to charge the <lb/>
            enemy first, and closed up his infantry, three hundred in <lb/>
            number, into a compact body, trusting that wherever he <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            attacked the enemy he should break through, although <lb/>
            they outnumbered him. They consisted of two moras of <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians : now Ephorus says that a mora consists <lb/>
            of 500 men, but Kallisthenes says 700, and some other <lb/>
            authorities, and amongst them Polybius, put it at 900.</p>
          <p>Gorgoleon and Theopompus, the polemarchs in command <lb/>
            of the Spartans, moved confidently to the attack of the <lb/>
            Thebans; and the onset was directed on both sides, with <lb/>
            great fury, specially at the persons of the leaders. The <lb/>
            two polemarchs dashed against Pelopidas, and both fell; <lb/>
            then the slaughter of their immediate followers produced <lb/>
            a panic in the whole force, and it gave way to the Thebans, <lb/>
            opening a lane through the centre as if for them to pass <lb/>
            through. But when Pelopidas led his men into the <lb/>
            passage thus offered, and assailed those who stood their <lb/>
            ground, passing through it with great slaughter, then all <lb/>
            fled in hopeless rout.</p>
          <p>The pursuit was not pressed far, for the Thebans feared <lb/>
            the vicinity of Orchomenus and of the Spartan reinforce­ <lb/>
            ment there ; but as far as winning the victory, and forcing <lb/>
            their way through the beaten enemy, they were completely <lb/>
            successful; so after setting up a trophy and spoiling the <lb/>
            dead they returned home in high spirits. For in all the <lb/>
            wars which had previously taken place, both with Greeks <lb/>
            and barbarians, it never before had happened that Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians should be conquered by an inferior force, nor <lb/>
            yet even when the numbers on each side were equal. <lb/>
            Wherefore they were invincible in their own estimation, <lb/>
            and established an ascendant over the minds of their <lb/>
            opponents, for they were wont to engage with men who <lb/>
            did not themselves think that with equal force they could <lb/>
            be a match for the same number of Spartans. But this <lb/>
            battle first proved to the rest of Greece that it is not only <lb/>
            the Eurotas, and the country between Babuke and Knacion* <lb/>
            that nurtures brave and warlike men, but that wherever <lb/>
            the youth of a nation fears disgrace and is willing to risk <lb/>
            life for honour, and shrinks from shame more than from <lb/>
            danger, these form the troops most terrible to their foes.</p>
          <p>XVIII. The Sacred Band, they say, was first formed by <lb/>
            Gorgidas, of 300 picked men, whom the city drilled and <note type="footnote"> * See vol. i. Life of Lykurgus, ch. vi. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            lodged in the Kadmeia when on service, wherefore they <lb/>
            were called the “ city ” regiment; for people then generally <lb/>
            called the citadel the “ city." Some say that this force was <lb/>
            composed of intimate friends, and indeed there is current <lb/>
            a saying of Pammenes, that Homer's Nestor is not a good <lb/>
            general when he bids the Greeks assemble by their tribes <lb/>
            and clans: <lb/>
            “That tribe to tribe, and clan to clan give aid," <lb/>
            whereas he ought to have placed side by side men who <lb/>
            loved each other, for men care little in time of danger for <lb/>
            men of the same tribe or clan, whereas the bond of affection <lb/>
            is one that cannot be broken, as men will stand fast in <lb/>
            battle from the strength of their affection for others, and <lb/>
            from feeling shame at showing themselves cowards before <lb/>
            them. Nor is this to be wondered at, seeing that men <lb/>
            stand more in awe of the objects of their love when they <lb/>
            are absent than they do of others when present, as was the <lb/>
            case with that man who begged and entreated one of the <lb/>
            enemy to stab him in the breast as he lay wounded, " in <lb/>
            order," said he, “ that my friend may not see me lying dead <lb/>
            with a wound in the back, and be ashamed of me." And <lb/>
            Iolaus, the favourite of Herakles, is said to have taken part <lb/>
            in his labours and to have accompanied him ; and Aristotle <lb/>
            says that even in his own time lovers would make their <lb/>
            vows at the tomb of Iolaus.</p>
          <p>It is probable, therefore, that the Sacred Band was so <lb/>
            named, because Plato also speaks of a lover as a friend <lb/>
            inspired from Heaven. Up to the battle of Chæronea it <lb/>
            is said to have continued invincible, and when Philip stood <lb/>
            after the battle viewing the slain, in that part of the field <lb/>
            where the Three Hundred lay dead in their armour, heaped <lb/>
            upon one another, having met the spears of his phalanx <lb/>
            face to face, he wondered at the sight, and learning that <lb/>
            it was the Band of Lovers, burst into tears, and said, <lb/>
            “ Perish those who suspect these men of doing or enduring <lb/>
            anything base."</p>
          <p>XIX. As to these intimacies between friends, it was <lb/>
            not, as the poets say, the disaster of Laius which first <lb/>
            introduced the custom into Thebes, but their lawgivers, <lb/>
            wishing to soften and improve the natural violence and <note type="footnote"> VOL. He </note> <note type="footnote"> o </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            ferocity of their passions, used music largely in their <lb/>
            education, both in sport and earnest, giving the flute <lb/>
            especial honour, and by mixing the youth together in the <lb/>
            palæstra, produced many glorious examples of mutual <lb/>
            affection. Rightly too did they establish in their city <lb/>
            that goddess who is said to be the daughter of Ares and <lb/>
            Aphrodite, Harmonia ; since, wherever warlike power is <lb/>
            duly blended with eloquence and refinement, there all <lb/>
            things tend to the formation of a harmonious and perfect <lb/>
            commonwealth.</p>
          <p>Now, as to the Sacred Band, Gorgidas originally placed <lb/>
            them in the first rank, and so spread them all along the <lb/>
            first line of battle, and did not by this means render their <lb/>
            valour so conspicuous, nor did he use them in a mass for <lb/>
            any attack, but their courage was weakened by so large <lb/>
            an infusion of inferior soldiery; but Pelopidas, after the <lb/>
            splendid display of their valour under his own eye at <lb/>
            Tegyra, never separated or scattered them, but would <lb/>
            stand the brunt of battle, using them as one body. For as <lb/>
            horses driven in a chariot go faster than those going loose, <lb/>
            not because they more easily cleave the air when galloping <lb/>
            in a solid body, but because their rivalry and racing with <lb/>
            one another kindles, their spirit, so he imagined that <lb/>
            brave men, inciting each other to an emulation in <lb/>
            adventure, would prove most useful and forward when <lb/>
            cting in one body.</p>
          <p>XX. When the Lacedæmonians made peace with all <lb/>
            be other Greeks and attacked the Thebans alone, and <lb/>
            Kleombrotus, their king, invaded Bœotia with ten thou­ <lb/>
            sand hoplites and a thousand cavalry, the danger <lb/>
            was not that they should be reduced to their former <lb/>
            condition, but absolute destruction plainly threatened their <lb/>
            city, and such terror prevailed as never before had been <lb/>
            in Bœotia. Pelopidas, when leaving his house, as his wife <lb/>
            wept at parting with him and begged him to be careful of <lb/>
            his life, answered, “ My dear, this is very good advice for <lb/>
            private soldiers, but we who are commanders must think <lb/>
            about saving the lives of others." When he reached the <lb/>
            camp, he found the Bœotarchs differing in opinion, and <lb/>
            he at once gave his voice for the plan of Epameinondas, <lb/>
            who voted for battle. He was not named Boeotarch, but <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            he was in command of the Sacred Band, and enjoyed <lb/>
            great confidence, as was only just a man should who <lb/>
            had given such proofs of patriotism.</p>
          <p>When, then, they had determined to face the enemy, and <lb/>
            taken up a position at Leuktra opposite to the Spartan <lb/>
            army, Pelopidas saw a vision in his sleep which greatly <lb/>
            disturbed him. In the plain of Leuktra there are the <lb/>
            tombs of the daughters of Skedasus, whom they call <lb/>
            Leuktridæ because of the place of their burial; for <lb/>
            there it was that they were buried after they had been <lb/>
            violated by some Spartan strangers. When this base and <lb/>
            impious deed was done, their father, as he could get no <lb/>
            satisfaction from the Lacedæmonians, invoked curses upon <lb/>
            the Spartan race, and slew himself at the tombs of his <lb/>
            daughters. Oracles and legends always had warned the <lb/>
            Spartans to beware of the vengeance of Leuktra, though <lb/>
            most of them did not understand it, and were not clear <lb/>
            as to the place, since a small sea-side town in Laconia is <lb/>
            also called Leuktron, and there is a place of the same name <lb/>
            near Megalopolis in Arcadia, and, also, this crime was <lb/>
            committed a long time before the battle.</p>
          <p>XXI. So now Pelopidas, when asleep in the camp, seemed <lb/>
            to see the maidens weeping over their tombs and invoking <lb/>
            curses on the Spartans, and Skedasus, who bade him <lb/>
            sacrifice a red virgin to the maidens, if he wished to <lb/>
            conquer his enemies. And as this command seemed to <lb/>
            him shocking and impious, he started up and consulted <lb/>
            the prophets and the generals. Some of them forbade him <lb/>
            to neglect or disobey the warning, quoting the famous old <lb/>
            instances of Menækeus the son of Kreon and Makaria the <lb/>
            daughter of Herakles, and, in later times, Pherekydes the <lb/>
            philosopher, who was killed by the Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            whose skin, according to some oracle, is still kept by their <lb/>
            kings, and Leonidas, who following the oracle did in some <lb/>
            sort offer himself as a victim on behalf of Greece; and <lb/>
            futhermore they spoke of those persons whom Themistokles <lb/>
            sacrificed to Dionysus before the sea fight-at Salamis. <lb/>
            All these are verified by the success which followed them. <lb/>
            And again, Agesilaus when starting from the same place <lb/>
            that Agamemnon did to fight the same enemies, was asked <lb/>
            by the god, during a vision at Aulis, to give him his <note type="footnote">C 2 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            daughter as a sacrifice; but he did not give her, but <lb/>
            by his softheartedness ruined the expedition, which in­ <lb/>
            gloriously failed. Others spoke on the other side, urging <lb/>
            that so barbarous and impious a sacrifice could not be <lb/>
            pleasing to any of the powers above, for, they said, it is <lb/>
            not the Typhons and giants of legend that rule in heaven, <lb/>
            but the father of all gods and men. To believe that <lb/>
            there are deities that delight in the blood and slaughter <lb/>
            of mankind is probably a foolish fancy; but if there <lb/>
            be such, it is our duty to disregard them and treat them <lb/>
            as powerless, for these strange and shocking desires can <lb/>
            only take their origin and exist in feeble and depraved <lb/>
            minds.</p>
          <p>XXII. While the chiefs of the army were engaged in <lb/>
            this discussion, and Pelopidas especially was at a loss <lb/>
            what to do, a filly escaped from some horses at pasture, <lb/>
            and running through the ranks stopped opposite them. <lb/>
            They admired her coat shining with the brightest red, <lb/>
            and the mettled courage of her neigh, but Theokritus the <lb/>
            prophet, comprehending what was meant, called to <lb/>
            Pelopidas: " Happy man! Here is your victim; let us <lb/>
            not expect any other virgin, but take the gift the gods <lb/>
            provide you." Hereupon they caught the filly and led it <lb/>
            to the tombs of the maidens. Here, after prayer, they <lb/>
            hung garlands on the tombs, and made the sacrifice with <lb/>
            joy, explaining to the whole army the vision of Pelopidas <lb/>
            and their reasons for the sacrifice.</p>
          <p>XXIII. In the battle, Epameinondas brought his main <lb/>
            body slantingly towards the left, in order that the Spartan <lb/>
            right might be drawn as far as possible away from the <lb/>
            other Greeks, and that by falling violently on Kleombrotus <lb/>
            with his whole force on that wing, he might overpower <lb/>
            and crush him. The enemy, perceiving what was being <lb/>
            done, began to alter their own formation, extending their <lb/>
            right, with the intention of outflanking and enveloping <lb/>
            Epameinondas. At this moment Pelopidas charged with <lb/>
            the Three Hundred in serried ranks. He caught the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians in a moment of confusion, when they were <lb/>
            not standing ready to make an attack, for Kleombrotus <lb/>
            had not time either to extend his right, or to bring the <lb/>
            troops back again and close up the ranks. Yet the <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            Spartans, skilled as they were to the highest pitch in war, <lb/>
            had been specially educated and practised in changing <lb/>
            their formation without disorder or confusion; each man <lb/>
            used any other as his right-hand or rear-rank man, and <lb/>
            wherever danger threatened they would meet it, forming <lb/>
            and fighting simultaneously. But now, when the main <lb/>
            Theban phalanx under Epameinondas, projecting before <lb/>
            all the rest of the line, bore down upon them, and when <lb/>
            Pelopidas, by a charge of inconceivable speed and daring <lb/>
            was already amongst their ranks, their spirit and discipline <lb/>
            was so shaken that the rout and slaughter of the Spartans <lb/>
            was such as had never been before. In this victory and <lb/>
            success as much glory belonged to Pelopidas, though not <lb/>
            one of the generals, and only in command of a few men, <lb/>
            as to Epameinondas, who was Bœotarch and leader of the <lb/>
            whole force.</p>
          <p>XXIV. In the invasion of Peloponnesus they were both <lb/>
            Bœotarchs, and they brought over to their side most of <lb/>
            the nations there, for they detached from the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian alliance Elis, Argos, the whole of Arcadia, and <lb/>
            most part of Laconia itself. It was mid-winter, a few <lb/>
            days only remained of the last month, and with the new <lb/>
            year the law was that the commands should be delivered <lb/>
            up and new generals chosen. Death was the penalty in <lb/>
            case of disobedience, and all the other Bœotarchs, fearing <lb/>
            this law and wishing to avoid the severe weather, wished <lb/>
            to withdraw the army homewards, but Pelopidas first, <lb/>
            supported by Epameinondas, encouraged his fellow citizens, <lb/>
            and crossed the Eurotas. He took many of their towns <lb/>
            and wasted all their country up to the sea-coast, with an <lb/>
            army of 70,000 Greeks, of whom the Thebans formed <lb/>
            less than a twelfth part. But the great reputation <lb/>
            which these men enjoyed made the rest follow them <lb/>
            without any formal vote or decree to do so; for the first <lb/>
            and most fundamental law is that which makes men in <lb/>
            need of help follow him who can save them; and even if, <lb/>
            like men sailing on a calm sea or anchored close to port, <lb/>
            they sometimes murmur at and brave their pilot, yet in <lb/>
            time of danger and storm they look up to him and place <lb/>
            all their hopes in him, so the Argives and Eleans and <lb/>
            Arcadians would at the council-board dispute the Theban <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            claims to supremacy, but in war and at critical moments <lb/>
            they of their own accord obeyed the Theban generals. In <lb/>
            this campaign, Arcadia was consolidated into one state; <lb/>
            they also separated Messenia, which had been annexed by <lb/>
            the Spartans, and bringing back the Messenian exiles <lb/>
            established them in the old capital, Ithome. On their <lb/>
            homeward march through Kenchreæ they gained a victory <lb/>
            over the Athenians, who attempted to harass them and <lb/>
            hinder their march through the narrow isthmus of <lb/>
            Corinth.</p>
          <p>XXV. After these exploits all men were full of admira­ <lb/>
            tion and wonder at their courage and success, but at home <lb/>
            the envious feelings of their countrymen and political <lb/>
            opponents, which grew along with the growth of their <lb/>
            renown, prepared a most scurvy reception for them. On <lb/>
            their return they were both tried for their lives, on the <lb/>
            ground that whereas the law is that during the first <lb/>
            month of the year, which they call Boukation, the <lb/>
            Bœotarchs must lay down their office, they had held it <lb/>
            for four additional months, during which they had been <lb/>
            settling the affairs of Messenia, Laconia, and Arcadia. <lb/>
            Pelopidas was tried first, and so incurred the greater <lb/>
            danger, but both were acquitted.</p>
          <p>Epameinondas, who thought that true courage and <lb/>
            magnanimity was best shown by forbearance in political <lb/>
            strife, bore this contemptible attack with patience, but <lb/>
            Pelopidas, who was of a hotter temper, and whose friends <lb/>
            encouraged him to revenge, chose this for its opportunity. <lb/>
            Menekleides the orator had been one of the conspirators <lb/>
            who came with Pelopidas and Mellon to Charon's house. <lb/>
            As, after the revolution, he did not obtain equal rights <lb/>
            with the rest, being a man of great ability in speaking, <lb/>
            but reckless and ill-conditioned, he took to using his <lb/>
            powers to slander and assail the men in power, and was <lb/>
            not silenced even by the result of that trial. He got <lb/>
            Epameinondas turned out of his office of Boeotarch, and <lb/>
            for a long time succeeded in lessening his influence in the <lb/>
            state; but Pelopidas he could not misrepresent to the <lb/>
            people, so he endeavoured to make a quarrel between him <lb/>
            and Charon. He used the usual method of detractors, who <lb/>
            if they themselves be inferior to the object of their spite, <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            try at any rate to prove that he is inferior to some one <lb/>
            else; and having the ear of the people, he was ever <lb/>
            singing the praises of Charon, and uttering panegyrics <lb/>
            on his skill and his success. He endeavoured to set up <lb/>
            a memorial of the cavalry battle at Platæa, before the <lb/>
            battle of Leuktra, in which the Thebans under Charon <lb/>
            were victorious, in the following manner. Androkydes of <lb/>
            Kyzikus had been entrusted by the state with the task of <lb/>
            painting a picture of some other battle, and had been <lb/>
            engaged on it at Thebes. When the war broke out, this <lb/>
            picture, nearly completed, was left in the hands of the <lb/>
            Thebans; and Menekleides persuaded them to put it up <lb/>
            publicly and to write on it the name of Charon, in order <lb/>
            to throw the glory of Pelopidas and Epameinond is into the <lb/>
            shade ; a silly exhibition of ill-feeling indeed, to compare <lb/>
            one poor skirmish, in which Gerandas, an obscure Spartan, <lb/>
            and some forty men fell, with the great and important <lb/>
            services of the others.</p>
          <p>Pelopidas indicted this proposal as illegal, arguing that <lb/>
            it was not the custom of the Thebans to show honour to <lb/>
            individuals, but to keep alive the name of a victory for the <lb/>
            glory of the country at large. He bestowed unmeasured <lb/>
            praise upon Charon throughout the trial, and proved <lb/>
            Menekleides to be a malignant slanderer. He was fined a <lb/>
            large sum, and not being able to pay it, subsequently <lb/>
            endeavoured to bring about a revolution in the state; by <lb/>
            which one gains some insight into his character.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Alexander, the tyrant of Pherme, was at this <lb/>
            time at open war with many states of Thessaly, and <lb/>
            threatened the independence of all. Ambassadors from <lb/>
            these states were sent to Thebes, begging for a military <lb/>
            force and a general to be despatched to their assistance. <lb/>
            Pelopidas, since Epameinondas was busy settling the <lb/>
            affairs of Peloponnesus, offered himself to the Thessalians, <lb/>
            as he could not bear that his talents and skill should lie <lb/>
            idle, and he thought that where Epameinondas was, no <lb/>
            second general could be needed. So he marched with a <lb/>
            sufficient army into Thessaly, took Larissa, and, when <lb/>
            Alexander begged for terms of peace, endeavoured to convert <lb/>
            him into a mild and I aw-abiding ruler. But he, a wild, <lb/>
            desperate, cruel barbarian, when he was accused of insolent <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            and grasping practices, and Pelopidas used harsh and <lb/>
            angry language, went off in a rage, with his body-guard. <lb/>
            Pelopidas, having relieved the Thessalians from fear of <lb/>
            the tyrant, and reconciled them one to another, proceeded <lb/>
            to Macedonia. Here Ptolemy was at war with Alexander <lb/>
            the king of Macedonia, and each of them had sent for him <lb/>
            to act as arbitrator and judge between them, thinking <lb/>
            that he would right whichever of them should prove to <lb/>
            have been wronged. He came, and settled their dispute, <lb/>
            and after bringing back the exiled party, took Philip, the <lb/>
            king's brother, and thirty other sons of the noblest <lb/>
            families as hostages, and kept them at Thebes, to show <lb/>
            the Greeks how far the Theban policy extended, merely <lb/>
            through its reputation for power and for justice.</p>
          <p>This was that Philip who afterwards endeavoured to <lb/>
            enslave Greece ; at that time he was but a lad, and lived <lb/>
            in the house of Pammenes. On this account he was <lb/>
            thought to be an imitator of Epameinondas, and perhaps <lb/>
            he did take to heart that great man's energy in war, <lb/>
            which was one of his virtues, but as to the spirit of self.. <lb/>
            restraint, justice, magnanimity and mildness, which formed <lb/>
            the true greatness of his character, of this Philip neither <lb/>
            by nature or education had the least idea.</p>
          <p>XXVII. After these events, the Thessalians again com­ <lb/>
            plained of Alexander of Pherme for attacking their cities, <lb/>
            and Pelopidas and Ismenias were sent as ambassadors to <lb/>
            them. Pelopidas, however, brought no army with him, <lb/>
            as no war was expected, and was forced to make use of <lb/>
            the native Thessalians in this emergency. As affairs in <lb/>
            Macedonia had again fallen into disorder (for Ptolemy had <lb/>
            assassinated the king, and was in possession of the <lb/>
            novereignty, while the friends of the deceased invited <lb/>
            Pelopidas to interfere), he wished to do something; and <lb/>
            having no troops of his own, he hired some local merce­ <lb/>
            naries and marched off at once against Ptolemy. When <lb/>
            they drew near to each other, Ptolemy by bribes induced <lb/>
            the mercenaries to desert to himself, but, fearing the mere <lb/>
            name and prestige of Pelopidas, he went out to him as <lb/>
            though he were the more powerful of the two, and after <lb/>
            greeting him and begging him to be his friend, he agreed <lb/>
            to hold the kingdom in trust for the brothers of the <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            deceased king, and to form a defensive and offensive <lb/>
            alliance with Thebes. For the fulfilment of these <lb/>
            conditions he gave as hostages his own son Philoxenus <lb/>
            and fifty of his companions, whom Pelopidas sent to <lb/>
            Thebes, but as he was angry at the desertion of his <lb/>
            mercenaries, and learned that their property, wives and <lb/>
            children were for the most part placed in Pharsalus, so <lb/>
            that by capturing that place he could make them pay <lb/>
            the penalty of their crime, he got together a force of <lb/>
            Thessalians and came to Pharsalus. When he was just <lb/>
            arrived, Alexander the tyrant appeared with his army. <lb/>
            Pelopidas and his friends supposed that he had come to <lb/>
            establish his innocence, and went to meet him, knowing <lb/>
            him to be profligate and bloodthirsty, yet fearing no harm, <lb/>
            because of the name of Thebes and their own personal <lb/>
            prestige. But he, when he saw them approaching him <lb/>
            unarmed and alone, at once secured them and took <lb/>
            Pharsalus, striking fear and terror into all his subjects; <lb/>
            for they expected that after an act of such daring lawless­ <lb/>
            ness he would spare no one, but treat them as one who <lb/>
            had made up his mind to lose his own life.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. The Thebans when they heard of this were <lb/>
            greatly moved, and at once despatched an army to the <lb/>
            rescue, but on account of some quarrel with Epameinondas <lb/>
            they appointed others to the command. The tyrant took <lb/>
            Pelopidas to Pheræ, and at first allowed any who chose tc <lb/>
            converse with him, supposing that he would be cast down <lb/>
            and humbled by his misfortunes; but when the people of <lb/>
            Pherme came to lament over him, Pelopidas bade them be <lb/>
            of good courage, as now if ever the tyrant would have to <lb/>
            pay the penalty of his crimes : and he sent a message to <lb/>
            the tyrant himself, saying that he was a strange man, to <lb/>
            torture and murder his wretched and innocent citizens <lb/>
            every day, and to spare him, who he knew would be sure <lb/>
            to wreak vengeance on him if he should escape. The tyrant, <lb/>
            admiring his spirit and fearlessness, said, " What! does <lb/>
            Pelopidas wish to die?" The other, hearing of this <lb/>
            answered, "Yes, that you may become even more hateful <lb/>
            to heaven than you are now, and so may die sooner."</p>
          <p>Hereupon he prevented the people from having access <lb/>
            to him, but Thebe, the daughter of Jason, and Alexander's. <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            wife, having heard from the guards of Pelopidas of his <lb/>
            daring and nobleness, desired to see the man and converse <lb/>
            with him. When she was come she did not, woman-like, <lb/>
            at once perceive the greatness of his mind in the position <lb/>
            in which he was, but judging from his short-cut hair, <lb/>
            his dress and his food, that he was treated ill and not as <lb/>
            became such a man, she wept. Pelopidas, not knowing <lb/>
            at first who she was, was surprised at this, but, when he <lb/>
            knew her, addressed her by her father's name, for he was <lb/>
            a companion and friend of Jason. When she said, “ I pity <lb/>
            your wife," “So do I pity you," answered he, " that <lb/>
            without being a prisoner you stay with Alexander." <lb/>
            This speech somehow touched the lady, for she was <lb/>
            grieved at the ferocity and licentiousness of the tyrant, <lb/>
            who, besides his other atrocities, had debauched her <lb/>
            youngest brother. She constantly visited Pelopidas, <lb/>
            and, talking to him of her sufferings, became filled with <lb/>
            courage, and with hatred of Alexander.</p>
          <p>XXIX. The Theban generals invaded Thessaly, but <lb/>
            through incompetence or misfortune effected nothing, and <lb/>
            had to retreat in disgrace. The state fined them ten thou­ <lb/>
            sand drachmas, but sent Epameinondas with the army. <lb/>
            There was at once a great fluttering of hope among the cities <lb/>
            of Thessaly at the reputation of that general, and the cause <lb/>
            of the tyrant tottered to its fall, such fear fell upon his <lb/>
            officers and friends, and such a longing to subvert his <lb/>
            government upon his subjects, who viewed the future <lb/>
            with hope, as now they expected to see the tyrant meet <lb/>
            with his deserts. However, Epameinondas, disregard­ <lb/>
            ing his own glory in comparison with the safety of <lb/>
            Pelopidas, and fearing that if Alexander were driven to <lb/>
            despair by seeing his kingdom falling to pieces, he might <lb/>
            turn upon him like a wild beast, conducted the war <lb/>
            remissly. By degrees and after slow preparation he sur­ <lb/>
            rounded the tyrant and confined him to one spot, so as <lb/>
            to be able to check any attack that he might venture on, <lb/>
            and yet not to excite his savage and ferocious nature; for <lb/>
            he had heard of his cruelty and disregard of what is right, <lb/>
            and how he would bury men alive, and dress them in the <lb/>
            skins of wild boars and bears and then set dogs at them <lb/>
            and hunt them with spears, making this his sport, and <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            how he surrounded two peaceful cities, Melibœa and <lb/>
            Skottusa, with his body-guard when the inhabitants were <lb/>
            at their public assembly, and slew them all from the <lb/>
            youth upwards, and how he had consecrated and crowned <lb/>
            the spear with which he killed his uncle Polyphron, <lb/>
            and used to address prayers to it and call it the Slayer. <lb/>
            Once when he saw a tragedian performing Euripides' <lb/>
            tragedy, the ‘ Troades,' he went suddenly out of the <lb/>
            theatre, and sent a message to him to be of good courage, <lb/>
            and not act worse for this, for he had not left the house <lb/>
            because he disliked his acting, but because he felt ashamed <lb/>
            that the citizens should see him weeping at the woes of <lb/>
            Ilekuba and Andromache, though he never had pitied any <lb/>
            of the people whom he had put to death himself. But lie, <lb/>
            terrified by the prestige and reputation of Epameinondas <lb/>
            for strategy, <lb/>
            "Let fall his feathers like a craven cock," <lb/>
            and quickly sent an embassy to him to make peace. <lb/>
            Epameinondas scorned to make a treaty of peace and <lb/>
            friendship between the Thebans and such a man, but <lb/>
            agreed to an armistice for thirty days, and taking Pelo­ <lb/>
            pidas and Ismenias returned home.</p>
          <p>XXX. When the Thebans heard that ambassadors were <lb/>
            being sent from Athens and Sparta to the Great King to <lb/>
            make an alliance with him, they also sent Pelcpidas, a <lb/>
            step most advantageous to his reputation. As he went on <lb/>
            his journey through the Persian provinces he excited the <lb/>
            greatest admiration, for the fame of his victories over the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians had spread trumpet-tongued through <lb/>
            Asia, and from the time of his first success at Leuktra it. <lb/>
            had begun to reach far and wide, some new exploit being <lb/>
            ever added to it, till it reached to the furthest peoples. <lb/>
            Next, when he reached the court, he was an object of <lb/>
            wonder and interest to the satraps, generals, and officers <lb/>
            there. " This is the man," they said, " who destroyed the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian dominion over sea and land, and who <lb/>
            reduced to the little state at the foot of Taygetus by the <lb/>
            Eurotas, that Sparta which a little while before went to <lb/>
            war under Agesilaus with the Great King himself about <lb/>
            Susa and Ecbatana." At this Artaxerxes himself was <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            pleased, and admired Pelopidas and showed him great <lb/>
            honour, as he wished it to appear that he was courted and <lb/>
            sought after by the most powerful Greeks. After an in­ <lb/>
            terview, in which he found that he spoke with sounder <lb/>
            sense than the Athenians, and greater simplicity than tho <lb/>
            Spartans, he esteemed him still more, and after the fashion <lb/>
            Of monarchs, did not conceal his regard, but let the other <lb/>
            ambassadors see plainly that he was highest in favour. <lb/>
            Of all the Greeks he showed Antalkidas the greatest <lb/>
            honour, when he took off his own wreath of flowers at <lb/>
            table and dipping it in scent, gave it him to put on. He <lb/>
            attempted no such refinements with Pelopidas, but gave <lb/>
            him presents, more splendid and valuable than was <lb/>
            customary, and assented to his proposals that all Greek <lb/>
            states should be independent, that Messenia should be <lb/>
            reconstituted, and that the Thebans should be accounted <lb/>
            the king's old friends.</p>
          <p>With these answers, and none of the presents except <lb/>
            such as were pledges of friendship and good will, he re­ <lb/>
            turned, to the great discredit of the other ambassadors. <lb/>
            The Athenians condemned and executed Timagoras, and <lb/>
            if it was for the amount of presents which he received, <lb/>
            rightly enough; for he not only took silver and gold, but <lb/>
            a costly bed and slaves to make it, as if Greeks did not <lb/>
            know how, and also eighty cows and their herdsmen, on <lb/>
            the pretence of wanting cow's milk for some weakness that <lb/>
            he suffered from; and at last he went down to the sea- <lb/>
            coast carried in a palanquin, and four talents were given <lb/>
            by the king to his bearers-still, it does not seem to have <lb/>
            been his venality which especially disgusted the Athenians. <lb/>
            At any rate, Epikrates, called the "Bearded," once brought <lb/>
            a motion before the assembly that instead of electing nine <lb/>
            archons yearly they should send nine poor citizens as <lb/>
            ambassadors to the Great King, that they might be enriched <lb/>
            by him, at which there was great laughter. But it was <lb/>
            because of the success of the Thebans that they were so <lb/>
            vexed, not reflecting on the power of Pelopidas's name, <lb/>
            and how far it outweighed all their rhetoric in the <lb/>
            estimation of one who always inclined to the stronger <lb/>
            side.</p>
          <p>XXXI. On his return, Pelopidas was welcomed with <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            no little gratitude because he had re-established Messenia, <lb/>
            and obtained freedom for all other Greeks. But Alexander <lb/>
            of Pheræ had relapsed into his old courses, and had <lb/>
            ravaged the territory of many cities of Thessaly. The <lb/>
            Phthiot Achæans and Magnetos formed a league to oppose <lb/>
            him, and hearing of Pelopidas's return, these cities sent to <lb/>
            Thebes begging for a force to help them and for him as <lb/>
            its general. The Thebans willingly decreed this, but <lb/>
            when all was ready and the general was about to march, <lb/>
            the sun was eclipsed and darkness fell upon the city. <lb/>
            Pelopidas, seeing that all men were disheartened at this, <lb/>
            thought that it was useless to force frightened men full <lb/>
            of presage of evil, to march with him, nor did he like to <lb/>
            risk the lives of six thousand citizens, but he offered his <lb/>
            own services to the Thessalians, and took with him three <lb/>
            hundred horsemen, volunteers and men of other states. <lb/>
            With this force he started, though forbidden by the <lb/>
            prophets and against the will of his fellow citizens, who <lb/>
            all held that a great portent had been shown in heaven <lb/>
            about some celebrated man. However, he was all the <lb/>
            fiercer against Alexander, remembering his own sufferings, <lb/>
            and hoping from his conversations with Thêbê, that by <lb/>
            this time his own family would have turned against him. <lb/>
            lie was also much encouraged by the glory of the action, <lb/>
            that, at a time when the Lacedæmonians were sending <lb/>
            out generals and governors to help Dionysius the Sicilian <lb/>
            tyrant, and when the Athenians had Alexander in their <lb/>
            pay, and had even set up a bronze statue of him as a public <lb/>
            benefactor, he might show the Greeks that it was the <lb/>
            Thebans alone who took up arms in defence of the op­ <lb/>
            pressed, and who put an end to the violent and illegal <lb/>
            rule of despots in Greece.</p>
          <p>XXXII. When he had come to Pharsalus and col­ <lb/>
            lected his army there, he marched straight to attack <lb/>
            Alexander. But he, seeing that Pelopidas's force of Thebans <lb/>
            was small, while he had more than double his numbers <lb/>
            of Thessalian hoplites, met him near the shrine of Thetis. <lb/>
            When some one said to Pelopidas that the tyrant was <lb/>
            coming on with a great force, he answered. “ So much <lb/>
            the better, for we shall conquer more."</p>
          <p>Between the two armies, near the place called Kynoske­ <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            phalæ, or the Dog's Heads, were some high and isolated <lb/>
            hills. Each party tried to occupy these with their infantry, <lb/>
            but Pelopidas, knowing his cavalry to be numerous and <lb/>
            good, sent it to charge that of the enemy. The enemy'a <lb/>
            horse was routed, and pursued over the plain, but mean­ <lb/>
            while Alexander had secured the hills, and when the <lb/>
            Thessalian infantry came afterwards, and tried to force <lb/>
            their way up the hill into that strong position, he was able <lb/>
            to cut down the foremost, while the rest suffered from his <lb/>
            missiles and could do nothing. Pelopidas now recalled <lb/>
            the cavalry, and sent it to attack the enemy's position in <lb/>
            flank, while he himself took his shield and ran to join the <lb/>
            infantry in their fight on the hill. Pushing his way <lb/>
            through their ranks till he reached the front he infused <lb/>
            such strength and ardour into them, that the enemy <lb/>
            thought that they attacked with new bodies as well as new <lb/>
            spirit. They repulsed one or two assaults, but seeing that <lb/>
            the infantry resolutely came on, and also that the cavalry <lb/>
            had returned from its pursuit and was threatening their <lb/>
            flank, they made an orderly retreat. Pelopidas, when he <lb/>
            gained the height, saw below him the whole of the enemy <lb/>
            not yet beaten, but confused and shaken. He stood still <lb/>
            and looked around him, seeking Alexander himself. <lb/>
            When he saw him, on the right, rallying and encouraging <lb/>
            his mercenaries, he could no longer restrain his rage, but <lb/>
            kindling at the sight, and, reckless of his own person and <lb/>
            of his duties as a general, rushed far beyond the rest, <lb/>
            shouting and challenging the tyrant to fight. He would <lb/>
            not await the attack, but took refuge in the ranks of his <lb/>
            body-guard. Pelopidas attacked these troops and cut them <lb/>
            down, wounding several mortally, but they from a distance <lb/>
            struck him through his armour with their spears, till the <lb/>
            Thessalians in great anxiety charged down the hill to <lb/>
            the rescue. But he had by this time fallen.</p>
          <p>The cavalry now charged and routed the whole body, <lb/>
            and pursuing them to a great distance, strewed the country <lb/>
            with corpses, for they cut down more than three thousand <lb/>
            of them.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. It was no wonder that the Thebans who were <lb/>
            there grieved at the death of Pelopidas, and called him <lb/>
            their father, their saviour, their teacher in all that was <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            best and noblest; but the Thessalians and their allies, <lb/>
            who decreed greater honours than had ever been shown to <lb/>
            any brave man, proved their gratitude to him, even more <lb/>
            by their sorrow. It is said that the men who were at the <lb/>
            fight did not lay aside their armour, nor unbridle their <lb/>
            horses, nor even bind up their wounds, when they heard <lb/>
            of his death, but warm as they were from victory, in their <lb/>
            arms, flocked round the corpse, piling up near it, as a <lb/>
            trophy, the arms of their slain enemies. They cut off <lb/>
            the manes of their horses, and their own hair, and many <lb/>
            went off to their tents, lit no fire, and ate no supper, but <lb/>
            there was such silence and despondency in the whole <lb/>
            camp as would have befitted men who had been defeated <lb/>
            and enslaved by the tyrant, not who had just won a great <lb/>
            and glorious victory over him.</p>
          <p>As soon as the sad news reached the cities of Thessaly, <lb/>
            the chief men, youths, children and priests came forth in <lb/>
            procession to receive his body, and carried trophies and <lb/>
            wreaths and golden armour in its honour. When the <lb/>
            body was about to be brought home, the chiefs of the <lb/>
            Thessalians begged the Thebans to allow them to bury <lb/>
            him, and one of them spoke as follows: " Allies, we beg <lb/>
            of you a favour which will prove to be an honour and a <lb/>
            comfort to us in this our great misfortune. We Thessa­ <lb/>
            lians shall never again escort Pelopidas, nor render him <lb/>
            the honours which he deserved ; but if we may have his <lb/>
            body to touch, and ourselves adorn it and bury it, we shall <lb/>
            then be able to show you that we Thessalians truly feel <lb/>
            this misfortune more than even you Thebans. For you <lb/>
            have only lost a good general, while we have lost that, <lb/>
            and our liberty too, since how can we ever have the heart <lb/>
            to ask you for another general, after not giving you your <lb/>
            Pelopidas back."</p>
          <p>This proposal the Thebans agreed to.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. No funeral was more splendid than this, not <lb/>
            indeed in the estimation of those who think that splen­ <lb/>
            dour lies in ivory and gold and purple, as Philistius <lb/>
            celebrates and praises the funeral of Dionysius, where his <lb/>
            tyranny concluded like the pompous finale of some great <lb/>
            tragedy. Alexander the Great, when Hephæstion died, not <lb/>
            only cut off the manes of the horses and mules, but actu­ <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            ally took down the battlements from the walls, that cities <lb/>
            might seem in mourning, presenting a shorn and woeful <lb/>
            look in contrast to their former appearance.</p>
          <p>But these were the commands of tyrants; they were done <lb/>
            under compulsion, and caused a feeling of dislike to the <lb/>
            person honoured, and of absolute hatred against those <lb/>
            who enforced them, but showed no gratitude or desire to <lb/>
            honour the dead. They were mere displays of barbaric pride <lb/>
            and boastful extravagance, which wastes its superfluity <lb/>
            on vain and useless objects; whereas, here was a private <lb/>
            citizen who died in a foreign land, without his wife, his <lb/>
            children or his friends, and, without any one asking for <lb/>
            it or compelling them to it, he was escorted to his grave, <lb/>
            buried and crowned with garlands by so many provinces <lb/>
            and cities, vying with one another in showing him <lb/>
            honour, that he seems to have enjoyed the most blessed <lb/>
            fate possible. For as Æsop says, the death of the <lb/>
            fortunate is not grievous, but blessed, since it secures <lb/>
            their felicity, and puts it out of Fortune's power. That <lb/>
            Spartan spoke well, who, when Diagoras, the Olympic <lb/>
            victor, was looking at his sons being in their turn <lb/>
            crowned as victors at Olympia, with his grandchildren <lb/>
            about him, embraced him and said, “ Die, Diagoras; <lb/>
            for you cannot rise to Olympus and be a god there." <lb/>
            Yet I do not suppose that any one would compare all <lb/>
            the Olympian and Pythian prizes together with one of. <lb/>
            Pelopidas's achievements, of which he performed many, <lb/>
            and lived the most part of his life esteemed and looked up <lb/>
            to, and at last, in his thirteenth Bœotarchy, when fighting <lb/>
            gloriously against a tyrant, he died in defence of the <lb/>
            liberties of Thessaly.</p>
          <p>XXXV. His death caused great sorrow to his allies, <lb/>
            but likewise benefited them; for the Thebans as soon as <lb/>
            they heard of the death of Pelopidas did not delay for a <lb/>
            moment to avenge his fall, but hastily marched with an <lb/>
            army of seven thousand hoplites and seven hundred <lb/>
            cavalry, under Malkitus and Diogeiton, against Alexander. <lb/>
            Finding that he was weakened and shorn of much of his <lb/>
            power, they compelled him to restore to the Thessalians <lb/>
            their cities, which he held, to liberate the Achaean a in <lb/>
            Magnesia and Phthiotis, to withdraw his garrisons from <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            those countries, and to swear to the Thebans, that he would <lb/>
            attack, and assist them to attack, any enemy they might <lb/>
            choose.</p>
          <p>The Thebans were satisfied with these terms; but I <lb/>
            will now recount how, shortly afterwards, Heaven exacted <lb/>
            retribution from him for the death of Pelopidas. Thêbê <lb/>
            his wife, as we have said before, had been taught by <lb/>
            Pelopidas not to fear the outward pomp and body-guard <lb/>
            of the tyrant, since she was within all his defences. She, <lb/>
            dreading his suspicious nature, and hating his cruelty, <lb/>
            made a plot with her three brothers, Tisiphonus, Pytholaus, <lb/>
            and Lykophron, which she carried out in the following <lb/>
            manner. The night patrol of the guard watched in the <lb/>
            house, but their bed-chamber was upstairs, and before <lb/>
            the door there was a dog chained as a guard, very savage <lb/>
            with every one except themselves and one of their <lb/>
            servants who fed it. Now when Thêbê determined to <lb/>
            make the attempt, she got her brothers concealed near at <lb/>
            hand during the day in one of the rooms, and when she <lb/>
            came, as usual, alone to Alexander's chamber, she found <lb/>
            him asleep. In a little time she came out again, and <lb/>
            ordered the servant to take away the dog, as the despot <lb/>
            wished to sleep undisturbed. Fearing that the stairs <lb/>
            would make a noise when the young men mounted, she <lb/>
            covered them with wool, and then brought up her <lb/>
            brothers, with their swords drawn. Leaving them outside <lb/>
            she herself went in, and taking down the sword that hung <lb/>
            over his head, showed it to them as a proof that he was <lb/>
            in their power and asleep. The young men now were <lb/>
            terrified, and hesitated to act; but she reproached them <lb/>
            bitterly, and swore that she would herself awaken <lb/>
            Alexander and tell him the whole plot. Between shame <lb/>
            and terror she got them in and placed them round the <lb/>
            bed, herself holding the light. One of them seized his <lb/>
            feet, another held his head back by the hair, and the third <lb/>
            despatched him with a stab of his sword, a death, perhaps, <lb/>
            easier than he deserved. He was the first, or perhaps the <lb/>
            only despot ever assassinated by his own wife. His body <lb/>
            after death was dragged about and trodden under foot by <lb/>
            the people of Pheræ, a recompense which his villanies <lb/>
            deserved. <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>

          <p>I. Poseidonius tells us that Marcus Claudius, who was <lb/>
            five times consul of the Roman people, was the son of <lb/>
            Marcus, and was the first of his family to receive the <lb/>
            name of Marcellus, which means warlike. Indeed, by his <lb/>
            experience he became a thorough soldier; his body was <lb/>
            strong and his arm powerful. He was fond of war and <lb/>
            bore himself with alordly arrogance, in battle though <lb/>
            otherwise he was of a quiet amiable dispositionfond <lb/>
            of Greek culture and literature, to theextent of respecting <lb/>
            and admiring these who knew it, though he from his <lb/>
            wanteisucould notmake such progress as he wished. <lb/>
            For the Roman chiefs of that period were,if any men eve? <lb/>
            were, condemned, in the words of Homer, <lb/>
            “From youth to age, disastrous wars to wage."*</p>
          <p>In their youth they fought the Carthaginians on the <lb/>
            Sicilian coast; in middle age they fought the Gauls in <lb/>
            defence of Italy itself; when advanced in years they again <lb/>
            contended with Hannibal and the Carthaginians, not, <lb/>
            as common men do, obtaining any relief from constant <lb/>
            service because of their old age, but ever urged by their <lb/>
            courage and nobility of soul to accept the commandin <lb/>
            newcampaigns.</p>
          <p>II. Marcellus was practised in all forms of battle, but <lb/>
            was especially skilful in single combat, so that he never <lb/>
            declined any man's challenge, and slew all who challenged <lb/>
            him. In Sicily he saved the life of his brother Otacilius <lb/>
            when in great peril, by holding his shield over him and <lb/>
            killing his assailants. For this conduct, young as he was, <note type="footnote"> * Il. xiv. 86. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            he received crOWDS- and rewards from the generals, and <lb/>
            as he grew in reputation was elected curule cedile by the <lb/>
            people, and augur by the priests. This is a kind of <lb/>
            priestly office, to which the law especially assigns the <lb/>
            observance of auguries drawn from the flight of birds. <lb/>
            During his tenure of the office of ædile, he was obliged, <lb/>
            much against his will, to commence a law-suit. He had <lb/>
            a son of his own name, in the bloom of youth, of great <lb/>
            beauty, and equally with it admired by his countrymen <lb/>
            for his modesty and education. Capitolinus, Marcellus's <lb/>
            colleague, a licentious and reckless man, made disgraceful <lb/>
            proposals to this lad. He first repelled his attacks alone, <lb/>
            but on a second attempt told his father, and Marcellus, <lb/>
            being much enraged, summoned the man before the Senate. <lb/>
            He attempted many quibbles and subterfuges, and ap­ <lb/>
            pealed to the tribunes of the people to support him, but <lb/>
            as they refused his application he betook himself to plead­ <lb/>
            ing denial of the charge. There being no witnesses of <lb/>
            what he had said, the Senate decided to send for the boy, <lb/>
            and when they saw how he blushed and wept with a <lb/>
            modesty mingled with unquenchable rage, they, without <lb/>
            requiring any other proof, found Capitolinus guilty, and <lb/>
            condemned him to pay a fine, with which Marcellus had <lb/>
            silver libation vessels made, and consecrated them to the <lb/>
            gods.</p>
          <p>III. After twenty-two years the first Punic War came <lb/>
            to an end, and the Romans turned their attention to <lb/>
            Gaulish troubles. The Insubrians, a Celtic tribe dwelling <lb/>
            in Italy at the foot of the Alps, powerful by themselves, <lb/>
            were collecting other forces, and enrolling all those Gauls <lb/>
            who fought for hire, called Gæsatæ.</p>
          <p>It was a wonderful and fortunate circumstance that this <lb/>
            Celtic war did not break out at the same time as that <lb/>
            with Carthage, but that the Gauls, like the gladiator who <lb/>
            waits to fight with the survivor of a pair o<unclear/> combatants, <lb/>
            had remained quiet during the whole of that war, and now <lb/>
            stepped forward and challenged the victors when they <lb/>
            were at leisure. Yet the war caused much terror, because <lb/>
            it would take place on their own frontier against their <note type="footnote"> * Civica corona. The civic crown was made of oak leaves, and was <lb/>
            given only to him who had saved the life of a fellow-citizen in war. </note> <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            neighbour states, and because of the ancient reputation of <lb/>
            the Gauls, whom the Romans seem to fear more than any <lb/>
            other nation. They once lost their city at their hands, <lb/>
            and afterwards passed a law that the priests should be <lb/>
            exempt from all military service, except in case of another <lb/>
            war with Gaul. Their alarm was shown both by their <lb/>
            preparations (for it is said that never before or since were <lb/>
            there so many thousand Romans under arms), and by <lb/>
            their extraordinary sacrifices. For though they never <lb/>
            observe the barbarous ceremonies of foreigners, but as far <lb/>
            as possible are humane and like the Greeks in their <lb/>
            religion, on the outbreak of this war they were compelled <lb/>
            to follow certain prophecies in the Sibylline books, and <lb/>
            bury alive two Greeks, a man and a woman, and likewise <lb/>
            two Gauls, in the place called the Cattle Market: and in <lb/>
            accordance with these prophecies they still up to this day <lb/>
            in the month of November perform religious mysteries, <lb/>
            which may not be seen or spoken of by either Greeks or <lb/>
            Gauls.</p>
          <p>IV. At the beginning of the war the Romanswere some­ <lb/>
            times victorious and sometimes defeated, without coming <lb/>
            to any decisive action, until the consulate of Flaminius <lb/>
            and Furius, who led a great army against the Insubrians. <lb/>
            Then the river that passes through Picenum ran blood, <lb/>
            and it was said that three moons were seen at the city of <lb/>
            Ariminum, and the augurs, who watch the omens at the <lb/>
            consular elections, declared that the appointment of these <lb/>
            consuls was wrong and of evil omen for the people. <lb/>
            Hereupon the Senate immediately sent despatches to the <lb/>
            camp recalling the consuls, that they might as soon as <lb/>
            possible return and lay down their office and so undertake <lb/>
            nothing as consuls against the enemy. Flaminius, when <lb/>
            he received these despatches, did not open them before he <lb/>
            had routed the barbarians in battle and overrun their <lb/>
            country. So when he returned to Rome loaded with spoil, <lb/>
            the people did not go out to meet him, but, because he had <lb/>
            not at once obeyed his orders, and had treated them with <lb/>
            insolent contempt, very nearly refused him his triumph, <lb/>
            and after the triumph reduced him to a private station, <lb/>
            forcing both him and his colleague to give up their office. <lb/>
            So much regard had the Romans for religion, that they <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            would not on occasions of the greatest good fortune over­ <lb/>
            look any neglect of the prophecies and customs of their <lb/>
            ancestors, holding it more important for the safety of the <lb/>
            state that their generals should reverence the gods than <lb/>
            that they should conquer the enemy.</p>
          <p>V. As an example of this, Tiberius Sempronius, a man <lb/>
            second to no one in Rome for courage and virtue, named <lb/>
            as his successors when consul Scipio Nasica and Caius <lb/>
            Marcius, and when they were actually in possession of <lb/>
            their provinces and armies he happened to consult a book <lb/>
            of sacred ritual, and found in it an old custom which he <lb/>
            did not know before. It was to this effect. When a consul <lb/>
            has hired a house or tent outside the city to watch the <lb/>
            flight of birds, if he be obliged before any certain omen <lb/>
            appears, to return to the city for what cause soever, he <lb/>
            must give up the place which he hired and take another, <lb/>
            and make his observation over again from the beginning. <lb/>
            This, it seems, Tiberius did not know, and it was after <lb/>
            rising the same place twice that he named these men consuls. <lb/>
            Afterwards, having discovered his error, he laid the matter <lb/>
            before the Senate; and that body did not despise this <lb/>
            apparently slight irregularity, but sent despatches to the <lb/>
            men, who at once left their provinces, returned to Rome, <lb/>
            and resigned their office. Now this happened in later <lb/>
            times ; but in the very times of which we write two men of <lb/>
            the best family were deprived of the priesthood: .Cornelius <lb/>
            Cethegus, because he handled the entrails improperly at a <lb/>
            sacrifice, and Quintus Sulpicius, because when he was <lb/>
            sacrificing, the created hat which he wore as flamen, fell <lb/>
            off his head. And because, when Minucius the dictator <lb/>
            was appointing Caius Flaminius his master of the knights, <lb/>
            the mouse which is called the coffin-mouse was heard to <lb/>
            squeak, they turned them out of their office and elected <lb/>
            others. But, though so elaborately careful in trifles, they <lb/>
            never admitted any superstitious observance, and neither <lb/>
            altered nor added anything to their ancestral ritual.</p>
          <p>VI. When Flaminius and his colleague had resigned <lb/>
            their offices, Marcellus was designated consul by the <lb/>
            interreges.† On entering upon his office he nominated <lb/>
            Cnæus Cornelius as his colleague. It was said that the <note type="footnote"> * Consul B.C. 204. </note><note type="footnote"> t Interreges were appointed when there were no consuls, to hold <lb/>
            comitia for the election of new ones. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            Gauls were offering terms of reconciliation, and that the <lb/>
            Senate wished for peace with them, but that Marcellus <lb/>
            raised the spirit of the people and excited them to con­ <lb/>
            tinue the war. But still a peace was concluded; and it <lb/>
            seems to have been the Gæsatæ who renewed the war, <lb/>
            by crossing the Alps and stirring up the Insubrians. <lb/>
            Thirty thousand in number, they joined that tribe, which <lb/>
            was many times larger, and in high spirits at once <lb/>
            attacked Acerræ, a city beyond the river Po. From that <lb/>
            place Britomartus with ten thousand Gæsatæ proceeded to <lb/>
            plunder the country near the Po.</p>
          <p>Marcellus hearing this left his colleague before Acerræ <lb/>
            with the infantry, heavy baggage, and one third of the <lb/>
            cavalry, and himself, with the rest of the cavalry and <lb/>
            about six hundred of the most active foot soldiers, marched <lb/>
            night and day till he fell in with the ten thousand Gæsatæ <lb/>
            at Clastidium, a Gaulish village which not long before <lb/>
            had been subject to the Romans. There was no time for <lb/>
            rest or refreshment; for his arrival was at once perceived <lb/>
            by the enemy, and his force despised, as he had so little <lb/>
            infantry with him, for the Celts thought nothing of his <lb/>
            cavalry. Admirable horsemen and proud of their superior <lb/>
            skill, they also had greatly the advantage of Mar­ <lb/>
            cellus in numbers, and at once, their king riding foremost, <lb/>
            charged the Romans with great impetuosity and terrible <lb/>
            threats, expecting to sweep them away. Marcellus, <lb/>
            fearing that they might surround and outflank his small <lb/>
            body, spread out his cavalry, thinning and widening his <lb/>
            line, until he presented a front nearly equal to that of the <lb/>
            enemy. He was now advancing to the charge, when his <lb/>
            horse, scared at the terrible display of the enemy, turned <lb/>
            short round, and forcibly carried him back. Marcellus, <lb/>
            fearing that this might cause superstitious terror to the <lb/>
            Romans, hastily wheeled his horse round on the bridle <lb/>
            hand, and having again directed him against the enemy, <lb/>
            paid his adorations to the sun, as though he had made this <lb/>
            circle not by chance, but of set purpose ; for the Romans <lb/>
            have this custom, of turning round to worship the gods, <lb/>
            and so he, as he was on the point of joining battle, vowed <lb/>
            that he would consecrate the finest of the enemies' arms <lb/>
            to Jupiter Feretrius.</p>
          <p>VII. At this moment the king of the Gauls, seeing him, <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            and conjecturing from his dress that he was the Roman <lb/>
            leader, rode out far beyond the rest, and made directly for <lb/>
            him, defiantly shouting a challenge, and brandishing his <lb/>
            spear. He was a man distinguished from the rest of the <lb/>
            Gauls by his tall stature and his complete armour, which <lb/>
            glittered like the lightning with gold and silver and all <lb/>
            kinds of gay devices with which it was incrusted. Mar­ <lb/>
            cellus, as he looked along the enemy's line, thought that <lb/>
            these were the finest arms, and were those about which he <lb/>
            had made his vow to Jupiter Feretrius. He rushed upon <lb/>
            the Gaul, pierced his breastplate with his spear, and by <lb/>
            the impetus of his horse bore him to the ground alive, and <lb/>
            with a second and third thrust killed him at once. <lb/>
            Leaping from his horse and seizing the armour of the dead <lb/>
            man, he said, looking up to heaven, " Jupiter Feretrius, <lb/>
            thou that seest the great deeds of generals and captains <lb/>
            in war, I call thee to witness that I am the third Roman <lb/>
            general that has slain the enemy's general and king, by <lb/>
            killing this man here with my own hand : and having <lb/>
            killed him I consecrate to thee the first and fairest of the <lb/>
            spoils. But do thou grant us like good fortune in the <lb/>
            rest of this war."</p>
          <p>Hereupon the Roman cavalry charged, not against <lb/>
            cavalry by itself, but they fought against infantry and <lb/>
            cavalry mixed together, and won a victory of an unparal­ <lb/>
            leled and wonderful kind; for never before or since that <lb/>
            day did such a body of horsemen rout such numbers of <lb/>
            horse and foot.</p>
          <p>Having slain the greater part of them, and collected <lb/>
            their arms and stores, he returned to his colleague, who <lb/>
            was with difficulty holding his own against the Celts <lb/>
            before the walls of the largest and most populous of <lb/>
            Gaulish cities. It is called Mediolanum, and is regarded <lb/>
            by the Cisalpine Gauls as their metropolis: consequently <lb/>
            they fought vigorously in its defence, and more besieged <lb/>
            Cornelius than were besieged by him. But when Marcellus <lb/>
            arrived, the Gæsatæ, as soon as they heard of the defeat <lb/>
            and death of their king, went home. Mediolanum fell, <lb/>
            and the Celts of their own accord surrendered the other <lb/>
            cities, and threw themselves upon the mercy of the Romans. <lb/>
            They received moderate terms of peace.</p><pb n="40"/>
            
          <p>VIII. By a decree of the Senate Marcellus alone <lb/>
            triumphed. His procession was glorious, as few others <lb/>
            have been, with the splendour and value of the booty <lb/>
            exhibited, and the great stature of the captives; but the <lb/>
            strangest and most interesting sight of all was the general <lb/>
            himself, as he appeared carrying the suit of armour of the <lb/>
            Gaul to offer it to the god. He had cut and trimmed the <lb/>
            trunk of a tall young oak tree, and had tied and hung <lb/>
            the spoils upon it, each put in its proper place. When <lb/>
            the procession began, he himself mounted his chariot <lb/>
            and four, and carried in state through the city, this <lb/>
            the most glorious of all his trophies of victory. The <lb/>
            army marched after him with their finest armour, <lb/>
            singing as they went songs and pæans of victory <lb/>
            in honour of the gods and their leader. Thus he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded till he reached the temple of Jupiter Feretrius. <lb/>
            Here he dismounted, and dedicated his spoils, being the <lb/>
            third, and, up to our day, the last who ever did so: first <lb/>
            comes Romulus, with the spoils of Acron of Cæninum; <lb/>
            second, Cornelius Cossus offered the spoils of Tolumnius <lb/>
            the Etruscan; third, Marcellus offered these spoils of <lb/>
            Britomartus, the king of the Gauls; after Marcellus, no <lb/>
            man.</p>
          <p>The god to whom they are offered is called Jupiter <lb/>
            Feretrius, according to some, from the trophy being carried <lb/>
            upon a feretrum, or bier, as it is called in the Greek tongue, <lb/>
            which then was much mixed with the Latin; but ac­ <lb/>
            cording to others, it is an attribute of Jupiter the Thun­ <lb/>
            derer, for the Romans call striking ferire. Others say <lb/>
            that the name comes from striking the enemy; fbr even <lb/>
            now in battle when they are pursuing the enemy they <lb/>
            keep shouting, " Feri,” that is, " Strike," to one another. <lb/>
            The word for ordinary spoils is spolia, but for these 8polia <lb/>
            opima. Yet it is said that Numa Pompilius speaks of first, <lb/>
            second, and third degrees of spolia opima, ordering the first <lb/>
            to be offered to Jupiter Feretrius, the second to Mars, and <lb/>
            the third to Quirinus; and that for the first the prize is <lb/>
            three hundred ases, two hundred for the second, and one <lb/>
            hundred for the third. But the most common story runs <lb/>
            that those spoils alone are spolia opima which are taken <lb/>
            at a pitched battle, and first of all, and by the general of <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            the one side from the general of the other. But of these <lb/>
            things enough.</p>
          <p>The Roman people were so overjoyed at that victory <lb/>
            and the end of the war that they made from the money <lb/>
            paid to ransom captives, a golden statue, and sent it to <lb/>
            Apollo at Delphi as a thank-offering, and gave a magni­ <lb/>
            ficent share of the booty to their allies, and even sent <lb/>
            many presents to Hiero the king of Syracuse, their friend <lb/>
            and ally.</p>
          <p>IX. When Hannibal invaded Italy, Marcellus was sent <lb/>
            with an army to Sicily: but when the disaster at Cannæ <lb/>
            took place, where many thousand Romans perished, and <lb/>
            only a few fugitives collected at Canusium, it was expected <lb/>
            that Hannibal would at once march to attack Rome, as he <lb/>
            had cut off the greater part of the army. Marcellus at once <lb/>
            sent a garrison of fifteen hundred men to guard the city, <lb/>
            and afterwards, in obedience to a senatus-consultum, went <lb/>
            to Canusium, and taking command of the fugitives <lb/>
            collected there, led them out of their fortified camp, to <lb/>
            show that he would not deliver up the country to the <lb/>
            enemy. The Romans had lost many of their most <lb/>
            capable leaders in the wars, and Fabius Maximus, who <lb/>
            had the greatest reputation, was blamed by them for <lb/>
            sloth and want of enterprise because of his excessive <lb/>
            caution in avoiding a defeat. Thinking, therefore, that <lb/>
            he was an excellent general for defence, not for attack, <lb/>
            they cast their eyes upon Marcellus, and in order to <lb/>
            combine his vigour and daring with the cautious and fat <lb/>
            seeing tactics of the other, they at one time elected them <lb/>
            both consuls, at another made the one consul with the <lb/>
            other serving as proconsul. Poseidonius tells us that <lb/>
            Fabius was called the shield of the state, and Marcellus <lb/>
            the sword. And Hannibal himself said that he feared <lb/>
            Fabius as a schoolmaster, but regarded Marcellus as an <lb/>
            antagonist, for the former prevented his doing any <lb/>
            mischief, while the latter might make him suffer some.</p>
          <p>X. At first Hannibal's soldiers, elated with their victory, <lb/>
            roamed with careless confidence out of their camp and <lb/>
            plundered the country; where Marcellus fell upon them, <lb/>
            and by a series of defeats considerably weakened them. <lb/>
            Next he went to Naples and Nola. At Naples he <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            encouraged the citizens, who of their own accord wished <lb/>
            well to the Roman cause; but at Kola he found the city <lb/>
            in a state of faction, as the senate were unable to restrain <lb/>
            the populace, who favoured Hannibal. There was one <lb/>
            Bandius, a man of the first nobility of the city, and <lb/>
            renowned for bravery. This man had fought at Cannæ <lb/>
            with conspicuous valour, and had slain many Carthaginians. <lb/>
            When after the battle he was found in a heap of slain <lb/>
            with his body pierced with darts, Hannibal, in admiration <lb/>
            of his courage, not only dismissed him without ransom, <lb/>
            but gave him presents and made him a personal friend. <lb/>
            Bandius, out of gratitude, was one of the most eager <lb/>
            partisans of Hannibal, and, having great influence with <lb/>
            the people, was urging them to revolt. Marcellus thought <lb/>
            that it Would be a crime to put to death a man of such <lb/>
            glorious antecedents, and who had taken part in one of <lb/>
            the greatest struggles of the Romans; and, besides his <lb/>
            natural kindliness, being able by his conversation to win <lb/>
            over any man of noble nature, he on one occasion when <lb/>
            greeted by Bandius inquired who he might be, though he <lb/>
            knew very well, but merely wanted a pretext and oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity for conversation with him. For, when he answered, <lb/>
            “ Lucius Bandius," Marcellus, as though surprised and <lb/>
            pleased, said, "Are you indeed that Bandius, of whom <lb/>
            all those who fought at Cannæ told us at Rome, the only <lb/>
            man who did not desert Paulus Æmilius the consul, but <lb/>
            who received upon his own body the greater part of <lb/>
            the darts which were aimed at him ? " Bandius admitted <lb/>
            that he was the man, and endeavoured to speak lightly of <lb/>
            his wounds, but Marcellus went on : “ Then, as you bear <lb/>
            about you such marks of your devotion to our cause, why <lb/>
            did you not at once come to me ? Do you think us slow to <lb/>
            requite the valour of our friends, when it is honoured even <lb/>
            by the enemy." Having spoken to him thus courteously, <lb/>
            he embraced him, and presented him with a war-horse and <lb/>
            five hundred silver drachmas.</p>
          <p>XI. After this Bandius became the firmest partisan and <lb/>
            ally of Marcellus, and a terrible denouncer and assailant of <lb/>
            the opposite party. This was a numerous one; and their <lb/>
            design was, when the Romans should march out of the <lb/>
            town against the enemy, to attack their baggage. Mar. <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            celIna, therefore, having marshalled his troops within the <lb/>
            city, brought the baggage to the gates, and by proclama­ <lb/>
            tion forbade the people of Nola to approach the walls. <lb/>
            Thus no force was visible, and he induced Hannibal to <lb/>
            march up to the city in disorderly array, as he supposed that <lb/>
            within it all was confusion. Then Marcellus ordered the <lb/>
            gate nearest him to be thrown open, and with the best <lb/>
            equipped of his cavalry charged out of it and fell upon the <lb/>
            enemy hand to hand. Presently the infantry poured out <lb/>
            of another gate, running with loud shouts: and while <lb/>
            Hannibal was dividing his forces to deal with them a <lb/>
            third gate opened, and from it issued the remainder of the <lb/>
            army, and from all sides attacked the Carthaginians, who <lb/>
            were bewildered at the unexpectedness of the attack, and <lb/>
            fought without spirit against their immediate assailants, <lb/>
            because of the others who they saw would soon beset <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>There first did Hannibal's troops give way before the <lb/>
            Romans, and were chased with great loss into their camp. <lb/>
            It is said that more than five thousand perished, and that <lb/>
            no more than five hundred Romans fell. But Livy does <lb/>
            not consider that a great defeat took place, or that so <lb/>
            many of the enemy fell, but he points out that Marcellus <lb/>
            gained much glory by that battle, and that the Roman <lb/>
            people took courage after their misfortunes, thinking that <lb/>
            it was not against an unconquerable and invulnerable foe <lb/>
            that they were fighting, but one who could be made to <lb/>
            Buffer as well as themselves.</p>
          <p>XII. For this reason, as one of the consuls was dead, <lb/>
            the people called for Marcellus, though he was absent, <lb/>
            to become his successor; and in spite of the efforts of the <lb/>
            government they put off the day of election until he came <lb/>
            to Rome from the army. He was elected consul by the <lb/>
            votes of all the tribes, but it thundered at the time, and <lb/>
            as the priests declared this an unpropitious omen, but did <lb/>
            not dare openly to oppose his election for fear of the people, <lb/>
            he himself voluntarily resigned his office. But he did not <lb/>
            avoid military service, but was created proconsul, and <lb/>
            returning to Nola and his army he harassed those who <lb/>
            had chosen the side of Hannibal. When the latter hastily <lb/>
            marched to the assistance of his friends, and offered to <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            fight a pitched battle with Marcellus, he declined ; but <lb/>
            subsequently, when the greater part of the Carthaginian <lb/>
            army was scattered in search of plunder, and no longer <lb/>
            expecting an attack, he fell upon it. He had distributed <lb/>
            long lances, such as are used on ship-board, among his <lb/>
            infantry, and instructed them to watch their opportunity <lb/>
            and hurl these from a distance at the Carthaginians, who <lb/>
            had no javelin-men, and whose heavy spears were only <lb/>
            used to thrust with at close quarters. In consequence, <lb/>
            it seems, of this, all who engaged with the Romans that <lb/>
            day turned their backs and shamefully fled, losing five <lb/>
            thousand killed, six hundred prisoners; while of their <lb/>
            elephants, four were killed and two taken alive. And, <lb/>
            what was of the greatest importance of all, on the third <lb/>
            day after the above battle, three hundred Spanish and <lb/>
            Numidian cavalry deserted to the Romans, a thing which <lb/>
            never had happened to Hannibal before, as, although his <lb/>
            army was composed of so many different nations, he had <lb/>
            been able for a very long time to inspire it with the same <lb/>
            spirit. These men faithfully served Marcellus and the <lb/>
            generals who succeeded him.</p>
          <p>XIII. Marcellus, when elected consul for the third time, <lb/>
            sailed to Sicily; for Hannibal's successes in the war had <lb/>
            encouraged the Carthaginians to recover that island, <lb/>
            especially as Syracusan politics were in a disturbed stato <lb/>
            in consequence of the death of the despot Hieronymus; <lb/>
            and on this account a Roman army under Appius had <lb/>
            already been sent there. When Marcellus had taken the <lb/>
            command of this army, he received a large accession of <lb/>
            Roman soldiers, whose misfortune was as follows. Of <lb/>
            the troops who fought with Hannibal at Cannae, some <lb/>
            fled, and some were taken alive, in such numbers that the <lb/>
            Romans scarcely thought that they had left sufficient <lb/>
            citizens to man the city walls, but this remnant was so <lb/>
            full of pride and so great of soul, that, though Hannibal <lb/>
            offered to release the captives for a small ransom, they <lb/>
            would not take them, but refused by a decree of the Senate, <lb/>
            and endured to see some of them put to death, and others <lb/>
            sold out of Italy as slaves. The mass of those who had <lb/>
            saved themselves by flight they sent to Sicily, with orders <lb/>
            not to set foot on the soil of Italy until the war with <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            Hannibal was over. So when Marcellus went to Sicily, <lb/>
            these men came in a body into his presence, and falling <lb/>
            on the ground before him besought him to permit them to <lb/>
            serve as honourable soldiers, promising with cries and <lb/>
            tears that they would prove by their actions that it was <lb/>
            more by their bad fortune than their cowardice that the <lb/>
            defeat at Canna) took place. Marcellus was touched with <lb/>
            compassion, and wrote to the Senate asking to be allowed <lb/>
            to fill up from these men the vacancies which would occur <lb/>
            in the ranks of his army. Much discussion followed ; and <lb/>
            at last the Senate decreed that Rome did not require the <lb/>
            services of cowardly citizens, but, if Marcellus nevertheless <lb/>
            wished to make use of them, they must not receive any <lb/>
            of the crowns and other rewards which are commonly <lb/>
            bestowed by generals as the prizes of valour. This decree <lb/>
            vexed Marcellus, and after the war in Sicily he returned <lb/>
            to Rome and blamed the Senate that, in spite of all that he <lb/>
            had done for them, they would not allow him to relieve so <lb/>
            many citizens from such a miserable position.</p>
          <p>XIV. In Sicily, at this time, he had just cause of <lb/>
            complaint against Hippokrates the Syracusan general, who, <lb/>
            favouring the Carthaginian side, and wishing to establish <lb/>
            himself as despot, put to death many Romans at Leontini. <lb/>
            Marcellus took Leontini by storm, and did no harm to the <lb/>
            inhabitants, but flogged and executed all the deserters <lb/>
            whom he found Hippokrates first sent to Syracuse a <lb/>
            story that Maicellus was exterminating the people of <lb/>
            Leontini, and when this report had thrown the city into <lb/>
            confusion he fell upon it and made himself master of it. <lb/>
            Marcellus hereupon proceeded to Syracuse with his whole <lb/>
            army, and encamping near the city sent ambassadors to <lb/>
            tell them what had really happened in Leontini. By this, <lb/>
            however, he gained nothing, as the Syracusans would not <lb/>
            listen to him (for the party of Hippokrates was in the <lb/>
            ascendant). He now attacked the city both by sea and <lb/>
            land, Appius commanding the land forces, while Marcellus <lb/>
            directed a fleet of sixty quinqueremes * full of armed men <lb/>
            and missile weapons. He raised a vast engine upon a raft <lb/>
            made by lashing eight ships together, and sailed with it <lb/>
            to attack the wall, trusting to the numbers and excellency <note type="footnote"> * Vessels of five banks of oars. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            of his siege engines, and to his own personal prestige. But <lb/>
            Archimedes and his machines cared nothing for this, <lb/>
            though he did not speak of any of these engines as being <lb/>
            constructed by serious labour, but as the more holiday <lb/>
            sports of a geometiician. He would not indeed have <lb/>
            constructed them but at the earnest request of King <lb/>
            Hiero, who entreated him to leave the abstract for the <lb/>
            concrete, and to bring his ideas within the comprehension <lb/>
            of the people by embodying them in tangible forms.</p>
          <p>Eudoxus and Archytas were the first who began to <lb/>
            treat of this renowned science of mechanics, cleverly <lb/>
            illustrating it, and proving such problems as were hard to <lb/>
            understand, by means of solid and actual instruments, as, <lb/>
            for instance, both of them resorted to mechanical means <lb/>
            to find a mean proportional, which is necessary for the <lb/>
            solution of many other geometrical questions. This they <lb/>
            did by the construction, from various curves and sections, <lb/>
            of certain instruments called mesographs. Plato was <lb/>
            much vexed at this, and inveighed against them for <lb/>
            destroying the real excellence of geometry by making it <lb/>
            leave the region of pure intellect and come within that of <lb/>
            the senses, and become mixed up with bodies which require <lb/>
            much base servile labour. So mechanics became separated <lb/>
            from geometry, and, long regarded with contempt by <lb/>
            philosophy, was reckoned among the military arts. How­ <lb/>
            ever Archimedes, who was a relative and friend of Hiero, <lb/>
            wrote that with a given power he could move any given <lb/>
            weight whatever, and, as it were rejoicing in the strength <lb/>
            of his demonstration, he is said to have declared that if he <lb/>
            were given another world to stand upon, he could move <lb/>
            this upon which we live. Hiero wondered at this, and <lb/>
            begged him to put this theory into practice, and show him <lb/>
            something great moved by a small force. Archimedes <lb/>
            took a three-masted ship, a transport in the king's navy, <lb/>
            which had just been dragged up on land with great labour <lb/>
            and many men ; in this he placed her usual complement <lb/>
            of men and cargo, and then sitting at some distance, <lb/>
            without any trouble, by gently pulling with his hand the <lb/>
            end of a system of pullies, he dragged it towards him <lb/>
            with as smooth and even a motion as if it were passing <lb/>
            over the sea. The king wondered greatly at this, and <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            perceiving the value of his arts, prevailed upon Archimedes <lb/>
            to construct for him a number of machines, some for the <lb/>
            attack and some for the defence of a city, of which he <lb/>
            himself did not make use, as he spent most of his life in <lb/>
            unwarlike and literary leisure, but now these engines were <lb/>
            ready for use in Syracuse, and also, the inventor was <lb/>
            present to direct their working.</p>
          <p>XV. So when the Romans attacked by sea and land at <lb/>
            once, the Syracusans were at first terrified and silent, <lb/>
            dreading that nothing could resist such an armament. <lb/>
            But Archimedes opened fire from his machines, throwing <lb/>
            upon the land forces all manner of darts and great stones, <lb/>
            with an incredible noise and violence, which no man could <lb/>
            withstand ; but those upon whom they fell were struck <lb/>
            down in heaps, and their ranks thrown into confusion, <lb/>
            while some of the ships were suddenly seized by iron hooks, <lb/>
            and by a counter-balancing weight were drawn up and <lb/>
            then plunged to the bottom. Others they caught by irons <lb/>
            like hands or claws suspended from cranes, and first pulled <lb/>
            them up by their bows till they stood upright upon their <lb/>
            sterns, and then cast down into the water, or by means of <lb/>
            windlasses and tackles worked inside the city, dashed them <lb/>
            against the cliffs and rocks at the base of the walls, with <lb/>
            terrible destruction to their crews. Often was seen the <lb/>
            fearful sight of a ship lifted out of the sea into the air, <lb/>
            swaying and balancing about, until the men were all <lb/>
            thrown out or overwhelmed with stones from slings, when <lb/>
            the empty vessel would either be dashed against the forti­ <lb/>
            fications, or dropped into the sea by the claws being let <lb/>
            go. The great engine which Marcellus was bringing up <lb/>
            on the raft, called the Harp, from some resemblance to that <lb/>
            instrument, was, while still at a distance, struck by a stone <lb/>
            of ten talents weight, and then another and another, which <lb/>
            fell with a terrible crash, breaking the platform on which <lb/>
            the machine stood, loosening its bolts, and tearing asunder <lb/>
            the hulks which supported it. Marcellus, despairing of <lb/>
            success, drew off his ships as fast as possible, and sent <lb/>
            orders to the land forces to retreat. In a council of war, <lb/>
            it was determined to make another assault by night; for <lb/>
            they argued that the straining cords which Archimedes <lb/>
            used to propel his missiles required a long distance to work <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            in, and would make the shot fly over them at close quar­ <lb/>
            ters, and be practically useless, as they required a long <lb/>
            stroke. But he, it appears, had long before prepared <lb/>
            engines suited for short as well as long distances, and <lb/>
            short darts to use in them; and from many small loop­ <lb/>
            holes pierced through the wall small scorpions, as they <lb/>
            are called, stood ready to shoot the enemy, though invisible <lb/>
            to them.</p>
          <p>XVI. When then they attacked, expecting that they <lb/>
            would not be seen, they again encountered a storm of <lb/>
            blows from stones which fell perpendicularly upon their <lb/>
            heads and darts which were poured from all parts of the <lb/>
            wall. They were forced to retire, and when they came <lb/>
            within range of the larger machines missiles were <lb/>
            showered upon them as they retreated, destroying many <lb/>
            men and throwing the ships into great disorder, without <lb/>
            their being able to retaliate. For most of the engines <lb/>
            on the walls had been devised by Archimedes, and the <lb/>
            Romans thought that they were fighting against gods and <lb/>
            not men, as destruction fell upon them from invisible <lb/>
            hands.</p>
          <p>XVII. However, Marcellus escaped unhurt, and sar­ <lb/>
            castically said to his own engineers: “ Are we to give in <lb/>
            to this Briareus of a geometrician, who sits at his ease by <lb/>
            the sea-shore and plays at upsetting our ships, to our <lb/>
            lasting disgrace, and surpasses the hundred-handed giant <lb/>
            of fable by hurling so many weapons at us at once?" <lb/>
            For indeed all the other Syracusans were merely the <lb/>
            limbs of Archimedes, and his mind alone directed and <lb/>
            guided everything. All other arms were laid aside and <lb/>
            the city trusted to his weapons solely for defence and <lb/>
            safety. At length Marcellus, seeing that the Romans had <lb/>
            become so scared that if only a rope or small beam were <lb/>
            seen over the wall they would turn and fly, crying out <lb/>
            that Archimedes was bringing some engine to bear upon <lb/>
            them, ceased assaulting the place, and trusted to time <lb/>
            alone to reduce it. Yet Archimedes had so great a mind <lb/>
            and such immense philosophic speculations that although <lb/>
            by inventing these engines he had acquired the glory of a <lb/>
            more than human intellect, he would not condescend to <lb/>
            leave behind him any writings upon the subject, regarding <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            the whole business of mechanics and the useful arts as <lb/>
            base and vulgar, but placed his whole study and delight <lb/>
            in those speculations in which absolute beauty and <lb/>
            excellence appear unhampered by the necessities of life, <lb/>
            and argument is made to soar above its subject matter, <lb/>
            since by the latter only bulk and outward appearance, <lb/>
            but by the other accuracy of reasoning and wondrous <lb/>
            power, can be attained: for it is impossible in the whole <lb/>
            science of geometry to find more difficult hypotheses <lb/>
            explained on clearer or more simple principles than in his <lb/>
            works. Some attribute this to his natural genius, others <lb/>
            say that his indefatigable industry made his work seem as <lb/>
            though it had been done without labour, though it cost <lb/>
            much. For no man by himself could find out the solution <lb/>
            of his problems, but as he reads, he begins to think that <lb/>
            he could have discovered it himself, by so smooth and <lb/>
            easy a road does he lead one up to the point to be proved. <lb/>
            One cannot therefore disbelieve the stories which are told <lb/>
            of him: how he seemed ever bewitched by the song of <lb/>
            some indwelling syren of his own so as to forget to eat <lb/>
            his food, and to neglect his person, and how, when dragged <lb/>
            forcibly to the baths and perfumers, he would draw <lb/>
            geometrical figures with the ashes on the hearth, and <lb/>
            when his body was anointed would trace lines on it <lb/>
            with his finger, absolutely possessed and inspired by the <lb/>
            joy he felt in his art. He discovered many beautiful <lb/>
            problems, and is said to have begged his relatives and <lb/>
            friends to place upon his tomb when he died a cylinder <lb/>
            enclosing a sphere, and to write on it the proof of the <lb/>
            ratio of the containing solid to the contained.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Such was Archimedes, who at this time <lb/>
            rendered himself, and as far as lay in him, the city, invin­ <lb/>
            cible.</p>
          <p>During the blockade Marcellus took Megara, one of the <lb/>
            most ancient of the Greek cities in Sicily, and also captured <lb/>
            Hippokrates' camp at Acrillæ, with a destruction of more <lb/>
            than eight thousand of his men, attacking them just as <lb/>
            they were planting the palisades of the rampart. He <lb/>
            overran a great part of Sicily, induced cities to revolt <lb/>
            from Carthage, and beat all forces that opposed him. A. <lb/>
            time went on, he took prisoner one Damippus, a Spartan, <note type="footnote"> VCL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            as he was sailing out of the harbour of Syracuse. The <lb/>
            Syracusans desired to ransom this man, and Marcellus, in <lb/>
            the course of many negotiations and conferences about <lb/>
            him, noticed that a certain tower was carelessly guarded, <lb/>
            and that men might be introduced into it secretly, as the <lb/>
            wall near it was easy to climb. Having, from his frequent <lb/>
            journeys to confer with the besieged near this tower, <lb/>
            gained a good idea of its height, he prepared scaling- <lb/>
            ladders, and waited till the Syracusans were engaged in <lb/>
            celebrating the feast of Artemis, and given up to drinking <lb/>
            and amusement. Not only did he gain the tower un­ <lb/>
            observed, but was able to occupy the whole circuit of <lb/>
            wall with his troops, and to break into the Hexapylon.* <lb/>
            When the Syracusans began to discover their position <lb/>
            and muster for their defence, he ordered trumpets to sound <lb/>
            on all sides, which produced great terror and tumult, as <lb/>
            they imagined that no part of the walls remained untaken. <lb/>
            Yet the strongest, and that too the largest and finest part <lb/>
            of the city, was still left, called Achradina, because it is <lb/>
            fortified on the side near the outer town, part of which is <lb/>
            called Neapolis, and part Tyche.</p>
          <p>XIX. These parts of the city were captured, and at day­ <lb/>
            break Marcellus moved down through the Hexapylon, <lb/>
            amidst the congratulations of his officers. It is said that <lb/>
            when, from the high ground he surveyed that great <lb/>
            and fair city, he burst into tears, thinking how sadly it <lb/>
            would soon be changed in appearance when sacked by <lb/>
            his soldiers. For none of his officers dared to oppose the <lb/>
            soldiers when they demanded the privilege of plunder, <lb/>
            and many encouraged them to burn and destroy. But <lb/>
            Marcellus would not so much as entertain the idea of this, <lb/>
            but, much against his will, was forced to permit them to <lb/>
            carry off the movable property and slaves, though he for­ <lb/>
            bade them to touch freemen, and gave strict orders that none <lb/>
            of the citizens of Syracuse should be slain, dishonoured, or <lb/>
            enslaved. Yet even after moderating their license to this <lb/>
            extent he thought that the city was sadly ill-treated, and <lb/>
            even in such a moment of triumph he showed great sorrow <lb/>
            and sympathy for it, as he saw such great wealth and <unclear/> <lb/>
            mfort swept away in a few hours; for the treasure was <note type="footnote"> * Hexapyloc, the place with six gates. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            said to DO not less than that which was afterwards taken <lb/>
            in Carthage itself. The rest of the city was taken after a <lb/>
            short time by treachery, and the soldiers insisted upon <lb/>
            plundering it, with the exception of the royal treasury, <lb/>
            which was confiscated to the state.</p>
          <p>Marcellus was especially grieved at the fate of Archi­ <lb/>
            medes. He was studying something by himself upon a <lb/>
            figure which he had drawn, to which he had so utterly <lb/>
            given up his thoughts and his sight that he did not notice <lb/>
            the assault of the Romans and the capture of the city, and <lb/>
            when a soldier suddenly appeared before him and ordered <lb/>
            him to follow him into the presence of Marcellus, he <lb/>
            refused to do so before he had finished his problem and its <lb/>
            solution. The man hereupon in a rage drew his sword <lb/>
            and killed him. Others say that the Roman fell upon him <lb/>
            at once with a sword to kill him, but he, seeing him, <lb/>
            begged him to wait for a little while, that he might not <lb/>
            leave his theorem imperfect, and that while he was <lb/>
            reflecting upon it, he was slain. A third story is that as <lb/>
            he was carrying into Marcellus's presence his mathematical <lb/>
            instruments, sundials, spheres, and quadrants, by which <lb/>
            the eye might measure the magnitude of the sun, some <lb/>
            soldiers met with him, and supposing that there was gold <lb/>
            in the boxes, slew him. But all agree that Marcellus was <lb/>
            much grieved, that he turned away from his murderer as­ <lb/>
            though he were an object of abhorrence to gods and men, <lb/>
            and that he sought out his family and treated them well.</p>
          <p>XX. The Romans up to this time had given foreign <lb/>
            nations great proofs of their skill in war and their courage <lb/>
            in battle, but had not shown any evidences of kindness of <lb/>
            heart, clemency, or any social virtue. Marcellus seems to <lb/>
            have been the first who exhibited the Romans in a more <lb/>
            amiable light to the Greeks. For he so dealt with his <lb/>
            adversaries, and treated so many individuals and cities <lb/>
            with kindness that even if any harsh treatment did befall <lb/>
            Enna, or Megara, or Syracuse, it was thought to be more <lb/>
            by the fault of the vanquished than of the victors. I will <lb/>
            mention one instance out of many. There is a city in <lb/>
            Sicily called Engyion, of no great size, but very ancient, <lb/>
            and renowned for the appearance there of the goddesses <lb/>
            called ‛ Mothers.' The foundation of the temple is ascribed <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            to the Cretans, and they used to show certain lancet <lb/>
            and helmets inscribed, some with the name of Meriones, <lb/>
            some of Ulixes, that is, Odysseus, which were dedicated to <lb/>
            these goddesses. This city was eager to espouse the <lb/>
            Carthaginian side, but was prevailed upon by one Nikias, <lb/>
            the leading man of the city, to join the Romans, by freely <lb/>
            speaking his mind in the public assembly and proving <lb/>
            that his opponents did not consult the true interests of the <lb/>
            state. These men, fearing his power and high reputation, <lb/>
            determined to kidnap him, and deliver him up to the <lb/>
            Carthaginians. Nikias, discovering this plot, quietly took <lb/>
            measures for his own security, but publicly made unseemly <lb/>
            speeches about the “ Mothers," and spoke of the received <lb/>
            tradition of their appearance with doubt and contempt, to <lb/>
            the delight of his enemies, as he seemed to be by these <lb/>
            actions justifying the treatment which they meant to inflict <lb/>
            upon him. When all their preparations for seizing him <lb/>
            were complete there was a public assembly of the citizens, <lb/>
            and Nikias, in the midst of a speech upon state policy, <lb/>
            suddenly fell to the ground, and after a short time, as all <lb/>
            men were, naturally, silent with surprise, he raised his <lb/>
            head, and turning it round he began to speak in deep and <lb/>
            trembling tones, which he gradually made shriller and <lb/>
            more intense, until, seeing the whole theatre, where the <lb/>
            meeting was, silent with horror, he threw off his cloak, <lb/>
            tore his tunic, and, half naked, rushed to the gate of the <lb/>
            theatre, crying out that he was pursued by the “ Mothers." <lb/>
            As no one dared to touch or stop him, from fear of the <lb/>
            gods, but all made way for him, he passed out of the city <lb/>
            gate, not omitting any of the cries and trembling of body <lb/>
            of a person under demoniacal possession. His wife, who was <lb/>
            in the secret, and her husband's confederate, first brought <lb/>
            her children and prostrated herself as a suppliant before <lb/>
            the goddesses, and then under pretence of seeking her <lb/>
            wandering husband managed to leave the city without <lb/>
            opposition. Thus they safely reached Marcellus at <lb/>
            Syracuse; and when, after enduring many affronts and <lb/>
            insolent proceeding from the people of Engyion Marcellus <lb/>
            took them all prisoners, and imprisoned them, meaning to <lb/>
            put them all to death, Nikias at first stood by weeping, but <lb/>
            at length, embracing Marcellus as a suppliant, he begged for <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            the lives of his countrymen, beginning with his own <lb/>
            personal enemies, until he relented, and set them all at <lb/>
            liberty. Nor did he touch their city, but gave Nikias <lb/>
            ample lands and rich presents. This story is told by <lb/>
            Poseidonius the philosopher.</p>
          <p>XXI. When the Romans recalled Marcellus, to conduct <lb/>
            the war in their own country, ho removed most of the <lb/>
            beautiful ornaments of the city of Syracuse, to be admired <lb/>
            at his triumphal procession, and to adorn Rome. For at <lb/>
            that time Rome neither possessed nor knew of any works <lb/>
            of art, nor had she any delicacy of taste in such matters. <lb/>
            Filled with the blood-stained arms and spoils of barbarians, <lb/>
            and crowded with trophies of war and memorials of <lb/>
            triumphs, she was no pleasant or delightful spectacle, <lb/>
            fit to feed the eyes of unwarlike and luxurious spectators, <lb/>
            but, as Epameinondas called the plain of Bœotia "the <lb/>
            Stage of Ares," and Xenophon called Ephesus " the Work­ <lb/>
            shop of War," so, in my opinion, you might call Rome at <lb/>
            that time, in the words of Pindar, " the Domain of Ares, <lb/>
            who revels in war." Wherefore Marcellus gained the greater <lb/>
            credit with the vulgar, because he enriched the city with <lb/>
            statues possessing the Hellenic grace and truth to nature, <lb/>
            while Fabius Maximus was more esteemed by the elders. <lb/>
            He neither touched nor removed anything of the kind <lb/>
            from the city of Tarentum, which he took, but carried off <lb/>
            all the money and other property, and let the statues <lb/>
            remain, quoting the proverb: " Let us," said he, " leave <lb/>
            the Tarentines their angry gods." They blamed Marcellus's <lb/>
            proceedings as being invidious for Rome, because he had <lb/>
            led not only men, but also gods as captives in his triumph, <lb/>
            and also because the people, who before this were ac­ <lb/>
            customed either to fight or to till the ground, and were <lb/>
            ignorant of luxury and indolent pleasures, like the Herakles <lb/>
            of Euripides, <lb/>
            “Unpolished, rough, but skilled in useful arts.” <lb/>
            were made by Marcellus into idle, babbling connoisseurs of <lb/>
            the fine arts and wasted the greater part of the day in talk <lb/>
            about them. He, however, prided himself upon this even <lb/>
            before creeks, saying that he had taught the ignorant <lb/>
            Romans to prize and admire the glories of Greek art. <pb n="54"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXII. Marcellus, whose enemies opposed his claim to <lb/>
            a triumph, on the ground that the campaign in Sicily <lb/>
            was not completely finished, and that he did not deserve <lb/>
            a third triumph, so far gave way as to lead the greater <lb/>
            triumphal procession as far as the Alban Mount, and only <lb/>
            to enter the city in the lesser form which the Greeks call <lb/>
            evan, and the Romans an ovation. The general conducts <lb/>
            this, not, as in the triumph, riding in a chariot, and four <lb/>
            with a crown of laurel, and with trumpets sounding before <lb/>
            him, but walking on foot in low shoes surrounded by flute <lb/>
            players, and crowned with myrtle, so as to look unwarlike <lb/>
            and joyous rather than terrible. And this is a great proof <lb/>
            to me that in old times it was the manner and not the <lb/>
            importance of the things achieved that settled the form of <lb/>
            triumph. Those generals who had gained their point by <lb/>
            battle and slaughter probably made their entry in that <lb/>
            martial and terrible fashion, having, as is customary in <lb/>
            lustrations of armies, crowned the men and wreathed their <lb/>
            arms with abundance of laurel: whereas the generals who <lb/>
            without an appeal to arms had settled matters satisfactorily <lb/>
            by negotiation and persuasive eloquence, were given by <lb/>
            custom this peaceful and festive entry into the city. For <lb/>
            the flute is a peaceful instrument, and the myrtle is the <lb/>
            favourite plant of Aphrodite, who above all the gods <lb/>
            hates violence and war. This form of triumph is called <lb/>
            ovation, not from the cry of " Evan," as most people think, <lb/>
            for the other also is accompanied with shouts and songs, <lb/>
            but the word had been twisted by the Greeks into one <lb/>
            that has a meaning in their language, and also they are <lb/>
            convinced that some honour is paid to Dionysus in this <lb/>
            ceremony, which God we name Evius and Thriambos. It <lb/>
            is curious to observe that the great Laconian lawgiver <lb/>
            arranged the sacrifices differently to those of Rome. In <lb/>
            Sparta those ex-generals who have accomplished their <lb/>
            purpose by persuasion or fraud sacrifice an ox, while those <lb/>
            who have done it by battle offer a cock. For, though <lb/>
            warlike to excess, they thought that a victory gained by <lb/>
            clever negotiation was greater and more befitting human <lb/>
            beings than one gained by force and courage. Which is <lb/>
            to be preferred, I leave to my readers' consideration.</p>
          <p>XXIII. When Marcellus entered upon his fourth <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            consulship, his enemies induced the Syracusans to send a <lb/>
            deputation to Rome, to complain loudly to the Senate of <lb/>
            the cruel and unjust treatment which they had received <lb/>
            from him. Marcellus chanced to be performing some <lb/>
            sacrifice in the Capitol; so when the Syracusans came to <lb/>
            the assembled Senate, begging for a hearing that justice <lb/>
            might be done them, the other consul stopped them, <lb/>
            feeling that Marcellus ought not to be attacked in his <lb/>
            absence. But Marcellus as soon as he heard of it, came to <lb/>
            the Senate-house, seated himself as consul, on the curule <lb/>
            chair, and despatched business; then, when this was <lb/>
            finished, he came down and placed himself as a private <lb/>
            person in the place where men on their trial usually <lb/>
            stood, and called on the Syracusans to prove their charges <lb/>
            against him. They were abashed at his majestic con­ <lb/>
            fidence of demeanour, and he who had been invincible in <lb/>
            arms seemed to them yet more terrible and unapproach <lb/>
            able in his consular purple. Nevertheless, encouraged by <lb/>
            the enemies of Marcellus, they began their impeachment, <lb/>
            and pleaded their cause in a piteous fashion, their chief <lb/>
            point being that they, who were friends and allies of the <lb/>
            Romans, had been treated in a way in which many other <lb/>
            generals had forborne to treat hostile cities. Marcellus <lb/>
            answered that they had done the Romans much harm, for <lb/>
            which they had received no punishment, except such as <lb/>
            could not be prevented in war, because victorious soldiers <lb/>
            cannot be restrained from sacking a town which they <lb/>
            have won, and their city, he said, was taken because they <lb/>
            had refused his frequent offers of terms of agreement. <lb/>
            They could not urge that they had been forced into war <lb/>
            by their despots, for they had themselves chosen those <lb/>
            very despots with the intention of going to war. After <lb/>
            both parties had been heard, the Syracusans, according to <lb/>
            custom, left the Senate-house. Marcellus came out with <lb/>
            them, leaving his colleague to preside over the assembly, <lb/>
            and stood outside the doors, without altering his usual <lb/>
            demeanour, either from fear of the result or anger against <lb/>
            the Syracusans, but serenely awaiting the verdict of the <lb/>
            Senate.</p>
          <p>When the question was voted upon, and he was an­ <lb/>
            nounced successful, the Syracusans prostrated themselves <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            before him, beseeching him with tears to put away his <lb/>
            anger against themselves, and to show pity on the city, <lb/>
            which was sensible to kindness, and would be grateful <lb/>
            to him. Maroellus was touched by their appeal; he <lb/>
            became reconciled to them, and was a constant benefactor <lb/>
            to their city. He restored them their freedom, their laws, <lb/>
            and what remained of their property, and the Senate con­ <lb/>
            firmed his acts. In return for this, besides many other <lb/>
            honours they passed a law that whenever Marcellus or <lb/>
            any of his descendants should land in Sicily, the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans should wear garlands of flowers and hold a festival <lb/>
            with sacrifices to the gods.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Next he proceeded against Hannibal; and <lb/>
            whereas nearly all the other consuls and generals, after <lb/>
            the disaster at Cannæ, had thought of nothing but <lb/>
            avoiding battles with him, and no one had dared to <lb/>
            measure himself with him in the field, he adopted the <lb/>
            opposite course, arguing that while they fancied that <lb/>
            they were wearing out Hannibal's army they did not <lb/>
            perceive that Italy was being consumed by it. Fabius, he <lb/>
            urged, thought too much of safety, and by his policy of <lb/>
            waiting, Rome, already drooping under its burdens, would <lb/>
            at the end of the war perish as well as Hannibal. He <lb/>
            was, he said, like those timid surgeons who shrink from <lb/>
            using decisive remedies, and who mistake the sinking <lb/>
            strength of the patient for the abatement of disease. His <lb/>
            first act was to take some important Samnite towns which <lb/>
            had revolted. Here he found great stores of corn and <lb/>
            money, and took three thousand of Hannibal's soldiers who <lb/>
            were there as garrison. Next, when Hannibal defeated <lb/>
            and killed Cnæus Fulvius, the proconsul in Apulia, with <lb/>
            a loss of eleven military tribunes and the greater part of <lb/>
            his army, Marcellus sent despatches to Rome, bidding the <lb/>
            citizens be of good courage, for he was already on the <lb/>
            march, and would abate Hannibal's exultation. Livy <lb/>
            tells us that these despatches when read did not diminish <lb/>
            the grief of the Romans, but added to their fear, as they <lb/>
            reflected that the risk they were about to run was so <lb/>
            much more serious than the defeat they had sustained, as <lb/>
            Marcellus was superior to Fulvius.</p>
          <p>According to his despatch, he instantly marched <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            against Hann bal into Lucania, and finding him en­ <lb/>
            trenched on some strong hills near the city of Numistro, <lb/>
            he himself encamped in the plain. On the following day <lb/>
            he was the first to draw out his army in battle array. <lb/>
            Hannibal descended from his position, and fought a great <lb/>
            and well-contested battle, for it began at the third hour, <lb/>
            and was scarcely over by dark, but without any decisive <lb/>
            result. At daybreak he again led out his army and defied <lb/>
            Hannibal to fight. But Hannibal retired; and Marcellus, <lb/>
            after stripping the corpses of the enemy, and burying his <lb/>
            own dead, pursued. His skill and good fortune were <lb/>
            greatly admired in this campaign, as he did not fall into <lb/>
            any of the numerous ambuscades which were prepared for <lb/>
            him by Hannibal, and in all his skirmishes came off <lb/>
            victorious. For this reason, as the comitia were impend­ <lb/>
            ing, the Senate thought that it would be better to call the <lb/>
            other consul away from Sicily than to recall Marcellus <lb/>
            just as he was thoroughly engaged with Hannibal. When <lb/>
            the other consul arrived, they bade him name Quintus <lb/>
            Fulvius dictator. For a dictator is not chosen by the <lb/>
            people or by the Senate, but one of the consuls or prætors <lb/>
            comes forward publicly and names whom he pleases <lb/>
            dictator. And this is the reason that the man so named is <lb/>
            called dictator; for dicere in Latin means to name. But <lb/>
            some think that the dictator is so called because he does <lb/>
            not require any vote or show of hands, but on his own <lb/>
            responsibility dictates his orders; indeed, the orders of <lb/>
            magistrates which are called by the Greeks diatagmata, <lb/>
            are called edicts by the Romans.</p>
          <p>XXV. When Marcellus's colleague came to Rome from <lb/>
            Sicily, he wished to name another person dictator, and, <lb/>
            that he might not be forced to act against his inclination, <lb/>
            he sailed away by night back to Sicily. Under these <lb/>
            circumstances the people nominated Quintus Fulvius <lb/>
            dictator, and the Senate wrote to Marcellus bidding him <lb/>
            vote for this person. He did so, confirming the choice of <lb/>
            the people, and was himself elected proconsul for the <lb/>
            following year. After a conference with Fabius Maximus, <lb/>
            at which it was arranged that the latter should make an <lb/>
            attempt on Tarentum, while Marcellus should constantly <lb/>
            engage Hannibal and so prevent his affording the town any <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            assistance, he set out, and came upon Hannibal near <lb/>
            Canusium. Hannibal frequently shifted his camp, and <lb/>
            tried to avoid a battle, but Marcellus was not to be shaken <lb/>
            off, and at length attacked his position, and by skirmishing <lb/>
            provoked him to fight. Marcellus sustained his attack, <lb/>
            and the battle was put an end to by night. Next morning <lb/>
            his troops were again beheld under arms, so that Hannibal <lb/>
            in great anxiety called together the Carthaginians and <lb/>
            besought them to fight as they had never done before. <lb/>
            “ You see," said he, " that even after our great victories, <lb/>
            we cannot rest in peace, unless we drive away this fellow." <lb/>
            The armies met; and Marcellus seems to have lost the <lb/>
            day by an unseasonable manoeuvre. His right wing was <lb/>
            suffering, and he ordered up one of the legions to support <lb/>
            it; but this change produced confusion in the ranks, and <lb/>
            gave the victory to the enemy, with a loss of two thousand <lb/>
            seven hundred men to the Romans. Marcellus, after retir­ <lb/>
            ing to his fortified camp, called together his soldiers, and <lb/>
            reproached them, saying that he saw before him the arms <lb/>
            and bodies of many Romans, but not one true Roman. <lb/>
            They begged forgiveness, but he answered that he could <lb/>
            not forgive them when defeated, but would forgive them <lb/>
            if victorious. On the morrow he said that he would renew <lb/>
            the battle, in order that the Romans might hear of their <lb/>
            victory before they heard of their defeat. After these <lb/>
            words he gave orders that the troops which had given way <lb/>
            should be supplied with rations of barley instead of corn; <lb/>
            which had such an effect upon them, that although many <lb/>
            were suffering from the hurts in the battle, yet, there was <lb/>
            not one who did not suffer more from the reproaches of <lb/>
            Marcellus than from his wounds.</p>
          <p>XXVI. At daybreak the scarlet robe, the well known <lb/>
            signal of battle, was displayed from the general's tent. <lb/>
            The disgraced troops, at their own request, were placed <lb/>
            in the first rank; the rest of the army followed under <lb/>
            their officers. Hannibal hearing of this exclaimed: <lb/>
            " Hercules ! What can one do with a man who knows not <lb/>
            how to bear either good or bad fortune. This is the only <lb/>
            general who, when victorious allows his foe no rest, and <lb/>
            when defeated takes none himself. We shall always, it <lb/>
            seems, have to be fighting this man, who is equally excited <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            to attack by his confidence when victor, and his shame <lb/>
            when vanquished."</p>
          <p>In the battle the men on each side were fighting on <lb/>
            equal terms, when Hannibal ordered his elephants to be <lb/>
            brought into the front rank and to attack the Roman lines. <lb/>
            Great tumult and disturbance was produced by this, but <lb/>
            one of the tribunes, by name Flavius, seizing a standard, <lb/>
            stood his ground, and struck the first elephant with the <lb/>
            spiked end of the staff, till he forced him to turn back. <lb/>
            He then attacked the next one, and those that followed. <lb/>
            Marcellus, seeing this, ordered his cavalry to ride as fast <lb/>
            as they could to the scene of the confusion and complete <lb/>
            the rout of the enemy. They charged briskly and pursued <lb/>
            the flying Carthaginians, cutting them down up to their <lb/>
            very camp. Great havoc was wrought by the wounded <lb/>
            elephants among them; and in all, over eight thousand <lb/>
            are said to have perished. Of the Roman force three <lb/>
            thousand were killed, and almost all the survivors were <lb/>
            wounded, which circumstance enabled Hannibal to leave <lb/>
            his camp by night unmolested, and remove himself from <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of Marcellus; for Marcellus could not <lb/>
            pursue, because of the number of wounded, but marched <lb/>
            in a leisurely manner towards Campania, and passed the <lb/>
            summer at Sinuessa, recruiting the health of his soldiers.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Hannibal, after he had thus torn himself free <lb/>
            from Marcellus, sent his army to plunder Italy as reck­ <lb/>
            lessly as though it were disbanded ; and in Rome Marcellus <lb/>
            was ill spoken of. His enemies induced Publius Bibulus, <lb/>
            a clever and violent partisan, to attack him. This man <lb/>
            frequently addressed assemblies of the people and urged <lb/>
            them to transfer the command to another general, since <lb/>
            “ Marcellus," he said,“ after a little sparring with the enemy <lb/>
            had gone to the hot baths to refresh himself as if after a <lb/>
            gymnastic contest." Marcellus, hearing of this, left the <lb/>
            army in charge of his legates, and went to Rome to clear <lb/>
            his reputation from these slanders; but, in consequence <lb/>
            of them he found that he was to undergo a trial. A day <lb/>
            was fixed; the people assembled in the Circus Flaminius; <lb/>
            Bibulus rose and impeached him. Marcellus spoke <lb/>
            shortly and simply in his own defence, but the highest <lb/>
            and noblest citizens spoke at great length in his praise, <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            calling on the people not to show themselv es by their vote <lb/>
            worse judges of war than Hannibal, who was always as <lb/>
            eager to avoid fighting with Marcellus, as he was to fight <lb/>
            with other generals. After these speeches had been delivered <lb/>
            the accuser was proved to be so far wrong in his impeach­ <lb/>
            ment, that Marcellus was not only honourably acquitted, <lb/>
            but actually elected consul for the fifth time.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. On assuming his office, he first put down an <lb/>
            insurrectionary movement in Etruria, by visiting the <lb/>
            various towns and using conciliatory language ; after this, <lb/>
            he wished to consecrate a temple, which he had built out <lb/>
            of the spoils of Sicily, to Glory and Valour, but being pre­ <lb/>
            vented by the priests on the ground that two gods could <lb/>
            not be included in one temple, he began to build another <lb/>
            one, being very much vexed at the opposition he <lb/>
            encountered, but influenced by omens: for he was dis­ <lb/>
            turbed at this time by many portentous occurrences, such <lb/>
            as several temples being struck by lightning, and the gold <lb/>
            in the temple of Jupiter being gnawed by the mice. It was <lb/>
            also reported that an ox had spoken with a human voice, <lb/>
            and that a child had been born with the head of an <lb/>
            elephant-so the priests kept him in Rome to conduct the <lb/>
            expiatory rites and atonements for these, though he was <lb/>
            fretting and eager to take the field; for no man ever was <lb/>
            so passionately desirous of anything as he was to measure <lb/>
            himself with Hannibal in battle. His one dream by night, <lb/>
            his only talk to his friends and colleagues, his sole prayer <lb/>
            to the gods was that he might meet Hannibal in a fair <lb/>
            field. I believe that he would most willingly have enclosed <lb/>
            both armies within a wall or palisade, and there have <lb/>
            fought out the quarrel. Had it not been that he was now <lb/>
            loaded with honours, and had given proofs of his supe­ <lb/>
            riority in wisdom and conduct to any other general, men <lb/>
            would have said that he showed a more boyish ambition <lb/>
            than befitted a man of his age; for he was over sixty <lb/>
            years old when he entered upon his fifth consulship.</p>
          <p>XXIX. However, when he had completed the necessary <lb/>
            sacrifices and purifications enjoined by the soothsayers, be <lb/>
            took the field with his colleague, and harassed Hannibal <lb/>
            much in the country between the towns of Bantia and <lb/>
            Venusia. Hannibal declined battle, but, learning that a <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            force was detached from the Roman army to attack the <lb/>
            Epizephyiian Lokrians, he laid an ambuscade on the <lb/>
            mountain near Petelia, and defeated them with a loss of <lb/>
            two thousand five hundred men. This excited Marcellus, <lb/>
            and he led his forces nearer to those of Hannibal. There <lb/>
            was between the two camps a hill of some strength as a <lb/>
            military post, overgrown with wood. Its sloping sides <lb/>
            afforded a view of either camp, and upon them appeared <lb/>
            the sources of several mountain streams.</p>
          <p>The Romans were surprised at Hannibal, that, having <lb/>
            had the first choice of so excellent a position as this, ho <lb/>
            had not occupied it, but left it to the enemy. It seems <lb/>
            that he indeed thought it a good place to encamp in, but <lb/>
            much better to lay an ambuscade in; and, wishing to use <lb/>
            it rather for this purpose, he filled the woods and glens <lb/>
            with javelinmen and spearmen, persuaded that the place <lb/>
            itself would, from its excellent qualities, attract the <lb/>
            Romans into it. Nor was he deceived in this expectation ; <lb/>
            for at once there was much talk in the Roman army <lb/>
            about the necessity of occupying the hill, and men pointed <lb/>
            out the advantages which would be gained over the <lb/>
            enemy by encamping on it, or if necessary, by fortifying <lb/>
            it. Now Marcellus determined to ride forward with a few <lb/>
            horsemen and reconnoitre it, so he sent for a soothsayer <lb/>
            and offered sacrifice. When the first victim was slain, <lb/>
            the soothsayer showed him that the liver had no head. <lb/>
            On sacrificing for the second time the head appeared of <lb/>
            unusual size, while all the other organs were excellent, <lb/>
            and this seemed to set at rest the fear which had been caused <lb/>
            by the former. Yet the soothsayers said that they were <lb/>
            even more disturbed and alarmed at this; for when after <lb/>
            very bad and menacing victims unusually excellent ones <lb/>
            appear, the sudden change is itself suspicious. But <lb/>
            “ Not fire, not walls of iron can hinder fate," <lb/>
            as Pindar says. Marcellus rode forth with his colleague <lb/>
            Crispinus and his son, who was military tribune, in all two <lb/>
            hundred and twenty horsemen. Of these none were <lb/>
            Romans; they were Etruscans, with the exception of twenty <lb/>
            men from Fregellæ, who had given constant proofs of their <lb/>
            courage and devotion to Marcellus. On the overhanging <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            crest of the woody hill, a man, unseen by the Romans, wa <lb/>
            watching their army. He signalled to the men in ambush <lb/>
            what was going on, so that they permitted Marcellus to <lb/>
            ride close to them, and then suddenly burst out upon him, <lb/>
            and surrounding his little force on all sides, struck and <lb/>
            threw their darts, pursued such as ran away, and fought <lb/>
            with those who stood their ground. These were the twenty <lb/>
            Fregellans. The Etruscans at the outset ran away panic- <lb/>
            stricken; but these men forming together defended the <lb/>
            consuls until Crispinus, struck by two darts, galloped <lb/>
            away, and Marcellus was pierced through the side with a <lb/>
            lance. Then even the few survivors of the Fregellans <lb/>
            left him lying there, and snatching up his son, who was <lb/>
            wounded, made their way back to the camp. The loss <lb/>
            amounted to little over forty killed, and five lictors and <lb/>
            eighteen horsemen taken. Crispinus, after a few days, died <lb/>
            of his wounds. Such a misfortune as this, losing both <lb/>
            consuls in one battle, never before betel the Romans.</p>
          <p>XXX. Hannibal heard of the fate of all the rest with <lb/>
            indifference, but when he was told that Marcellus had <lb/>
            fallen he himself hastened to the place, and stood for a long <lb/>
            time beside the corpse, admiring its strength and beauty. <lb/>
            He made no boastful speech, and showed no joy in his <lb/>
            countenance, as a man who had slain a troublesome and <lb/>
            dangerous enemy, but, wondering at the strangeness of <lb/>
            his ending, he drew the ring from the dead man'is finger, <lb/>
            and had the corpse decently attired and burned. The <lb/>
            relics he gathered into a silver urn, upon which he placed <lb/>
            a golden crown, and sent it to Marcellus's son. But on the <lb/>
            way some Numidians fell in with the party who were <lb/>
            escorting the urn, and while they tried to take it away <lb/>
            and the others struggled to retain it, the bones were <lb/>
            scattered on the ground. Hannibal, on hearing of this, <lb/>
            said, “Nothing can be done against the will of heaven." <lb/>
            He ordered the Numidians to be punished, but took no <lb/>
            further thought about collecting or sending away the <lb/>
            relics of Marcellus, concluding that some god had decreed <lb/>
            the strange death and strange lack of burial which had <lb/>
            befallen him. This is the story related by Cornelius <lb/>
            Nepos and Valerius Maximus, but Livy and Augustus <lb/>
            Caesar declare that the urn was brought to his son, and <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            that it was splendidly buried. Besides his monuments <lb/>
            at Rome there was a gymnasium at Katana in Sicily <lb/>
            which bore his name, and statues and votive tablets from <lb/>
            the plunder of Syracuse were set up in Samothrace in the <lb/>
            temple of the gods called Kabeiri, and in Lindus (in <lb/>
            Rhodes) in the temple of Athena.</p>
          <p>On his statue there, according to Poseidonius, these <lb/>
            verses are written: <lb/>
            "This monument, 0 stranger, doth enshrine <lb/>
            Marcellus, of the famous Claudian line, <lb/>
            Who seven times was consul, and in fight <lb/>
            His country's foes o'erthrew and put to flight.”</p>
          <p>For the writer of this epitaph counted his two procon­ <lb/>
            sulates as well as his five consulates. His family re­ <lb/>
            mained one of the chief in Rome down to the time of <lb/>
            Marcellus, the nephew of Augustus, who was the son of <lb/>
            Octavia, Augustus's sister, and Caius Marcellus. He died <lb/>
            in the office of ædile while yet a bridegroom, having just <lb/>
            married Augustus's daughter Julia. In honour of his <lb/>
            memory his mother Octavia established a library, and <lb/>
            Augustus built a theatre, both of which bore his name. <pb n="64"/>

            <title type="sub">THE COMPARISON OF PELOPIDAS WITH MARCELLUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. THE particulars which we thought worth extracting <lb/>
            from the histories of Pelopidas and Marcellus are related <lb/>
            above. Their dispositions and habits were so nearly <lb/>
            identical (for both were brave, laborious, and high- <lb/>
            spirited) that the only point in which they differ appears <lb/>
            to be that Marcellus put the inhabitants of several <lb/>
            captured cities to the sword, whereas Epameinondas and <lb/>
            Pelopidas never slew any one after they had conquered <lb/>
            him, nor enslaved any captured city; indeed, had they been <lb/>
            alive, it is said that the Thebans never would have so <lb/>
            treated the town of Orchomenus. As to their exploits, <lb/>
            that of Marcellus against the Gauls was great and wonder­ <lb/>
            ful, when he drove before him with his little band of <lb/>
            horsemen so great a multitude of horse and foot together, <lb/>
            the like of which one cannot easily find to have been done <lb/>
            by any other general, and the killing of the chief of the <lb/>
            enemy. The same thing was attempted by Pelopidas, but <lb/>
            the despot was too quick for him, and he perished without <lb/>
            succeeding in his effort. Yet with these we may compare <lb/>
            his deeds at Leuktra and Tegyra, the most important and <lb/>
            glorious of all his feats of arms, while we have no exploit <lb/>
            of Marcellus which corresponds to his management of the <lb/>
            ambuscade by which he brought back the exiled popular <lb/>
            party to Thebes, and destroyed the despots. Indeed, of <lb/>
            all deeds performed by secrecy and stratagem, this takes <lb/>
            the van. Hannibal, no doubt, was a terrible enemy to <lb/>
            Rome, as were the Lacedæmonians to Thebes; yet it is <lb/>
            an established fact that at Tegyra and at Leuktra they <lb/>
            gave way before Pelopidas, whereas Marcellus, according <lb/>
            to Polybius, never once defeated Hannibal, but that general <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            appears to have remained undefeated until the time of <lb/>
            Scipio. But we believe, following Livy, Cæsar, Cornelius <lb/>
            Nepos, and, among Greek historians, king Juba, that <lb/>
            Hannibal suffered some defeats at the hands of Marcellus ; <lb/>
            yet they never produced any signal result, and we may sus­ <lb/>
            pect that the African sometimes only pretended to have lost <lb/>
            the day. But what Marcellus is so justly admired for, is <lb/>
            that after such great armies had been routed, their generals <lb/>
            killed, and the whole military system of Rome thrown <lb/>
            into confusion, he inspired his troops with a confidence <lb/>
            that enabled them to hold their own against the enemy. He <lb/>
            roused his men from their former timid and disheartened <lb/>
            condition, making them eager to distinguish themselves <lb/>
            in battle, and, what is more, never to yield the victory <lb/>
            without a determined struggle. And all this, as far as any <lb/>
            single man could, was effected by Marcellus; for whereas <lb/>
            his troops had been accustomed to be well satisfied if they <lb/>
            escaped with their lives from Hannibal, he taught them <lb/>
            to be ashamed of surviving defeat, to blush to give way <lb/>
            ever so little, and to grieve if they were not victorious.</p>
          <p>II. Since, then, Pelopidas never was defeated when he was <lb/>
            in command, and Marcellus gained more victories than any <lb/>
            Roman of his time; perhaps he who was so hard to conquer <lb/>
            may, in consideration of his many successes, be held equal <lb/>
            to him who never suffered a reverse. Moreover, the one <lb/>
            took Syracuse, while the other failed before Lacedæmon. <lb/>
            But I hold it a greater feat than taking Sicily, to have <lb/>
            marched upon Sparta, and been the first man to cross the <lb/>
            Eurotas, unless indeed it should be said that the credit of <lb/>
            this exploit belongs more to Epameinondas than to Pelopi­ <lb/>
            das, as also does the battle of Leuktra, whereas the glory <lb/>
            of Marcellus's achievements is all his own. For he took <lb/>
            Syracuse alone, and beat the Gauls without his colleague, <lb/>
            and, with no one to assist him, but every one hanging <lb/>
            back, he measured himself with Hannibal and changed <lb/>
            the whole complexion of the war, by being the first to <lb/>
            introduce a daring policy.</p>
          <p>III. As for their deaths, I can praise neither one nor <lb/>
            the other, but I am grieved at the unworthy manner of <lb/>
            their end. It is strange, that Hannibal was never even <lb/>
            wounded in a number of battles which it would weary <note type="footnote"> VOL. U. </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            one to recount; and I admire the conduct of Chrysantas <lb/>
            in Xenophon's * Cyropædia,’ who, when standing with his <lb/>
            weapon drawn, about to strike an enemy, heard the <lb/>
            trumpet sound the recall, and leaving his man, quietly <lb/>
            and orderly retreated. Yet Pelopidas may be excused by <lb/>
            his excitement during a battle, and his courage, which <lb/>
            urged him to avenge himself on the enemy, for the best <lb/>
            thing is for the general to be victorious and to survive, <lb/>
            and the next, for him to die “ breathing forth his life in <lb/>
            valour " as Euripides says. Thus his death becomes no <lb/>
            accident, but a premeditated act. And besides Pelopidas's <lb/>
            spirit, the assured victory which he saw within his grasp, <lb/>
            could he but kill the despot, not unreasonably made him <lb/>
            make his desperate attack; for it would have been hard <lb/>
            for him to obtain another opportunity of distinguishing <lb/>
            himself so gloriously. But Marcellus, without any neces­ <lb/>
            sity, without the excitement which sometimes in perilous <lb/>
            circumstances overpowers men's reason, pushed heedlessly <lb/>
            into danger, and died the death of a spy rather than a <lb/>
            general, risking his five consulships, his three triumphs, <lb/>
            his spoils and trophies won from kings against the worth­ <lb/>
            less lives of Iberian and Numidian mercenaries. They <lb/>
            themselves must have felt ashamed at their success, that <lb/>
            the bravest, most powerful, and most celebrated of the <lb/>
            Romans should have fallen among a reconnoitring party of <lb/>
            Fregellans. Still, let not this be regarded as a reproach <lb/>
            to these great men, but rather a complaint addressed on <lb/>
            their own behalf to them, especially to that courage, to <lb/>
            which they sacrificed all their other virtues, disregarding <lb/>
            their lives, as though their loss would fall upon themselves <lb/>
            only, and not upon their friends and native country. <lb/>
            After his death, Pelopidas was buried by his allies, fight <lb/>
            ing for whom he died; but Marcellus was buried by the <lb/>
            enemy at whose hands he fell. The first was an enviable <lb/>
            end, but the other is greater, as the spectacle of an enemy <lb/>
            honouring the valour by which he has suffered is greater <lb/>
            than that of a friend showing gratitude to a friend. <lb/>
            In the one case it is the man's glory alone that is respected, <lb/>
            in the other, his usefulness and value are as much thought <lb/>
            of as his courage.</p><pb n="67"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ARISTEIDES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ARISTEIDES, the son of Lysimachus, was of the tribe <lb/>
            Antiochis, and the township of Alopekæ. There are <lb/>
            various reports current about his property, some saying <lb/>
            that he lived in poverty, and that on his death he left two <lb/>
            daughters, who remained a long while unmarried because <lb/>
            of their poverty; while this general opinion is contra­ <lb/>
            dicted by Demetrius of Phalerum in his book on Sokrates, <lb/>
            where he mentions an estate at Phalerum which he knew <lb/>
            had belonged to Aristeides, in which he was buried, and <lb/>
            also adduces other grounds for supposing him to have <lb/>
            been a wealthy man. First, he points out that Aristeides <lb/>
            was Archon Eponymus, an office for which men were <lb/>
            chosen by lot from the richest class, that of the Penta­ <lb/>
            kosiomedimni, or citizens who possessed a yearly income <lb/>
            of five hundred medimni * of dry or liquid produce. <lb/>
            Secondly, he mentions the fact that he was ostracised: <lb/>
            now, ostracism never was used against poor men, but <lb/>
            against those who descended from great and wealthy <lb/>
            houses, and whose pride made them feared and disliked <lb/>
            by their fellow citizens. Thirdly, and lastly, he writes <lb/>
            that Aristeides placed in the temple of Dionysus tripods <lb/>
            dedicated to the god by a victorious chorus, which even <lb/>
            in my own time are still to be seen, and which bear the <lb/>
            inscription: “ The tribe Antiochis won the prize; Aris­ <lb/>
            teides was choragus; Archestratus taught the chorus." <lb/>
            Now this, which seems to be the strongest argument of <lb/>
            all, is really the weakest. Epameinondas, whom all men <lb/>
            know to have been born and to have passed his life in <lb/>
            the greatest possible poverty, and Plato the philosopher, <lb/>
            both exhibited excellent choruses, the former bearing the <lb/>
            expense of a chorus of men playing on the flute, while the <note type="footnote"> * The Attic medimnus contained 12 imperial gallons, or 1<unclear/> tr shels. </note> <note type="footnote"> F I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            latter exhibited a cyclic. chorus of boys. Plato's ex. <lb/>
            penses were borne by Dionysius of Syracuse, and those <lb/>
            of Epameinondas by Pelopidas and his friends. Good men <lb/>
            do not always refuse to receive presents from their friends, <lb/>
            but, though they would scorn to make money by them, <lb/>
            they willingly receive them to further an honourable <lb/>
            ambition. Panætius, moreover, proves that Demetrius is <lb/>
            wrong in the matter of the tripods, because from the time <lb/>
            of the Persian war to the end of the Peloponnesian war <lb/>
            there are only two Aristeides recorded as victors, neither <lb/>
            of whom can be identified with the son of Lysimachus, as <lb/>
            the father of one of them was Xenophilus, and the other <lb/>
            was a much more modern personage, as is proved by his <lb/>
            name being written in the characters which came into use <lb/>
            after the archonship of Eukleides, and from the name of <lb/>
            the poet or teacher of the chorus, Archestratus, whose <lb/>
            name we never meet with in the time of the Persian war, <lb/>
            but who taught several choruses (that is, wrote several <lb/>
            successful plays) during the Peloponnesian war. These <lb/>
            remarks of Panætius must, however, be received with <lb/>
            caution. As to ostracism, any man of unusual talent, <lb/>
            nobility of birth, or remarkable eloquence, was liable to <lb/>
            suffer from it, for Damon, the tutor of Perikles, was <lb/>
            ostracised, because he was thought to be a man of superior <lb/>
            intellect. Idomeneus tells us that Aristeides obtained the <lb/>
            office of archon, not by lot, but by the universal voice of <lb/>
            the people. Now, if he, was archon after the battle of <lb/>
            Platæa, as Demetrius himself admits, it is highly <lb/>
            probable that his great reputation after such glorious <lb/>
            successes may have obtained for him an office usually <lb/>
            reserved for men of wealth. Indeed, Demetrius evidently <lb/>
            tries to redeem both Aristeides and Sokrates from the <lb/>
            reproach of poverty, as though he imagined it to be a <lb/>
            great misfortune, for he tells us that Sokrates not only <lb/>
            possessed a house, but also seventy minæ which were <lb/>
            borrowed by Krito.</p>
          <p>II. Aristeides became much attached to Kleisthenes, <lb/>
            who established the democratic government after the <note type="footnote"> * A circular or cyclic chorus was strictly one which danced and sang <lb/>
            round an altar, but especially refers to the dithyrambic choruses <lb/>
            appropriated to Bacchus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            expulsion of the sons of Peisistratus; but his reverence <lb/>
            and admiration for Lykurgus the Lacedæmonian led him <lb/>
            to prefer an aristocratic form of government, in which he <lb/>
            always met with an opponent in Themistokles, the son <lb/>
            of Neokles, the champion of democracy. Some say that <lb/>
            even as children they always took opposite sides, both in <lb/>
            play and in serious matters, and so betrayed their several <lb/>
            dispositions: Themistokles being unscrupulous, daring, <lb/>
            and careless by what means he obtained success, while <lb/>
            the character of Aristeides was solid and just, incapable of <lb/>
            deceit or artifice even in sport. Ariston of Keos tells us <lb/>
            that their hatred of one another arose from a love affair. <lb/>
            Stesilaus of Keos, the most beautiful youth of his time, <lb/>
            was passionately adored by both of them with an affection <lb/>
            which passed all bounds. Nor did they cease their rivalry <lb/>
            when this boy's youthful bloom had passed away, but, as <lb/>
            if this had merely been a preliminary trial, they each <lb/>
            plunged into politics with great vigour and with utterly <lb/>
            different views. Themistokles obtained a large following, <lb/>
            and thus became an important power in the state, so that, <lb/>
            when some one said to him that he would make a very <lb/>
            good governor of Athens, provided he were just and <lb/>
            impartial with all, he answered, " Never may I bear rule <lb/>
            if my friends are to reap no more benefit from it than <lb/>
            any one else."</p>
          <p>Aristeides, on the other hand, pursued his way through <lb/>
            political life unattended, because, in the first place, he <lb/>
            neither wished to do wrong in order to please his friends, <lb/>
            nor to vex them by refusing to gratify their wishes; and <lb/>
            also because he observed that many men when they were <lb/>
            supported by a strong party of friends were led into the <lb/>
            commission of wrong and illegal acts. He, therefore, <lb/>
            conceived that a good citizen ought to trust entirely to <lb/>
            his own rectitude, both in word and in deed.</p>
          <p>III. In spite of this, however, when Themistokles was <lb/>
            using every kind of political manoeuvre to thwart him, <lb/>
            he was forced to retaliate by similar measures, partly in <lb/>
            order to defend himself, and partly to check the power <lb/>
            of his opponent, which depended on the favour shown <lb/>
            him by the people. He thought it better that he should <lb/>
            occasionally do the people some slight wrong than that <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            Themistokles should obtain unlimited power. At last, <lb/>
            when Themistokles even proposed some useful measure, <lb/>
            he opposed it and threw it out. On this occasion he <lb/>
            could not refrain from saying, as he left the public <lb/>
            assembly, that the Athenians could not be saved unless <lb/>
            they threw both himself and Themistokles into the <lb/>
            barathrum.* Another time he brought forward a bill, <lb/>
            which was vehemently debated upon, but was at length <lb/>
            carried. But just before the votes of the people were <lb/>
            given, he, perceiving from what had been said that it <lb/>
            would prove a bad law, withdrew it. Frequently he <lb/>
            made use of other persons to bring forward propositions, <lb/>
            lest the public should suffer from the contest which would <lb/>
            otherwise take place between Themistokles and himself. <lb/>
            Indeed, his evenness of temper was the more remarkable <lb/>
            when contrasted with the changefulness of other poli­ <lb/>
            ticians, for he was never unduly excited by the honours <lb/>
            which were bestowed upon him, and bore misfortune with <lb/>
            a quiet cheerfulness, thinking it to be his duty to serve <lb/>
            his country, not merely without being paid for it in <lb/>
            money, but without even gaining honour for so doing. <lb/>
            This was the reason, I suppose, that when Æschylus's <lb/>
            verses on Amphiaraus were being recited in the theatre : <lb/>
            " Not just to seem, but just he loves to be; <lb/>
            And deep lie ploughs his noble mind with thought, <lb/>
            To reap a harvest thence of great designs,” <lb/>
            all men turned and looked towards Ariste<unclear>des</unclear>, thinking <lb/>
            that he came nearest to this ideal virtue.</p>
          <p>IV. He stood up vigorously for justice, not merely when <lb/>
            it was his interest and that of his friends, but when it <lb/>
            was in favour of his enemies and contrary to his own <lb/>
            personal feelings to do so. It is said that once when <lb/>
            arguing a cause against one of his enemies in a court of <lb/>
            law, the judges refused to hear the other party speak <lb/>
            in his own defence, after listening to the speech of <lb/>
            Aristeides, but were about to condemn him unheard. At <lb/>
            this Aristeides came forward and vigorously supported <lb/>
            his antagonist's claim to be allowed his legal right of <note type="footnote"> * The barathrum at Athens was a deep pit, with hooks on the sides, <lb/>
            into which criminals were caat. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            reply. Again, when acting as arbitrator between two <lb/>
            persons, one of them said that his adversary had done <lb/>
            much wrong to Aristeides. “My good man," said he, <lb/>
            " do not tell me of this, but tell me whether he has <lb/>
            wronged you or not, for I am judging your cause, not <lb/>
            my own."</p>
          <p>When elected to administer the revenues of the state <lb/>
            he proved that not only his own colleagues, but those <lb/>
            who had previously held office, had embezzled large sums, <lb/>
            especially Themistokles, <lb/>
            .. A clever man, but with an itching palm."</p>
          <p>For this cause Themistokles, when Aristeides’ accounts <lb/>
            were audited, prosecuted him on a charge of malversation, <lb/>
            and, according to Idomeneus, obtained a verdict.</p>
          <p>However, the better class of citizens being grieved at <lb/>
            this, not only remitted the fine, but at once elected him to <lb/>
            the same office. He now pretended to regret his former <lb/>
            rigour, and was much more remiss in performing his duties, <lb/>
            which rendered him very popular with those who were in <lb/>
            the habit of embezzling the public money, so that they <lb/>
            were loud in his praise, and canvassed the people on his <lb/>
            behalf, trusting that he might be re-elected archon. But <lb/>
            when the voting was about to begin, he rose and rebuked <lb/>
            the Athenians. " When," he said, “ I did you true and <lb/>
            honourable service, I was disgraced by you; now, when I <lb/>
            have permitted much of the public money to be stolen, I <lb/>
            am thought to be an excellent citizen. But I myself am <lb/>
            more ashamed of the honour which you now pay me, than <lb/>
            I am of my former conviction, and I am sorry for you, <lb/>
            because among you it is esteemed more honourable to abet <lb/>
            evil-doers than to guard the national property."</p>
          <p>By speaking thus and exposing the peculation which <lb/>
            was being practised, he closed the mouths of all those who <lb/>
            wore so loudly commending him as an honest man, but <lb/>
            gained the applause of all true and honourable men.</p>
          <p>V. When Datis was sent by Darius, nominally to punish <lb/>
            the Athenians for the burning of Sardis, but really to <lb/>
            enslave the whole of Greece, he landed at Marathon, and <lb/>
            commenced laying waste the country. Of the ten generals <lb/>
            appointed by the Athenians for the conduct of the war, <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            Miltiades had the highest reputation, while Aristeides held <lb/>
            the second place. He used his influence in the council of <lb/>
            war to support the proposition of Miltiades to fight the <lb/>
            enemy at once, and also, as each general had sole command <lb/>
            for one day, when his day came round, he gave it to <lb/>
            Miltiades, thus teaching his colleagues that obedience to <lb/>
            those who know how to command is not any disgrace, but <lb/>
            a noble and useful act. By this means he was enabled to <lb/>
            put an end to the rivalries between the generals, and to <lb/>
            strengthen Miltiades by concentrating in him the power <lb/>
            which had before been passed from hand to hand. In the <lb/>
            battle the Athenian centre was hard pressed, as the Persians <lb/>
            resisted longest in that part of their line which was opposed <lb/>
            to the tribes Leontis and Antiochis. Here Themistokles <lb/>
            and Aristeides each showed conspicuous valour, fighting <lb/>
            side by side, for the former was of the tribe Leontis, the <lb/>
            latter of the tribe Antiochis. After the victory was won, <lb/>
            and the Persians forced into their ships, they were observed <lb/>
            not to sail towards the Archipelago, but to be proceeding <lb/>
            in the direction of Athens. Fearing that they might catch <lb/>
            the city defenceless, the Athenians determined to hurry <lb/>
            back with nine tribes to protect it, and they accomplished <lb/>
            their march in one day. Aristeides, with his own tribe, <lb/>
            was left to guard the prisoners and the plunder, and well <lb/>
            maintained his reputation. Although gold and silver was <lb/>
            lying about in heaps, with all kinds of rich tapestry and <lb/>
            other countless treasures, he would neither touch them <lb/>
            himself nor allow the others to do so, though some helped <lb/>
            themselves without his knowledge. Among these was <lb/>
            Kallias, the torch-bearer in the Eleusinian mysteries. One <lb/>
            of the prisoners, taking him for a king because of his long <lb/>
            hair and fillet, fell on his knees before him, and having <lb/>
            received his hand as a pledge for his safety pointed out <lb/>
            to him a great store of gold concealed in a pit. Kallias <lb/>
            now acted most cruelly and wickedly. He took the gold, <lb/>
            and killed the poor man for fear that he should tell it to <lb/>
            the others. It is said that ever afterwards the descendants <lb/>
            of Kallias were jeered at by the comic poets, as being of <lb/>
            the family of the man who found the gold in the pit.</p>
          <p>Immediately after these events, Aristeides was chosen <lb/>
            as Archon Eponymus, that is, the archon who gives his <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            name to the year. Demetrius of Phalerum says that he <lb/>
            filled this office shortly before his death, and after the <lb/>
            battle of Plataea. But in the public records of Athens one <lb/>
            cannot find any archon of the name of Aristeides among <lb/>
            the many who filled the office after Xanthippides, in whose <lb/>
            archonship Mardonius was defeated at Platæa, whereas <lb/>
            the name of Aristeides does occur next to that of Phanippus, <lb/>
            in whose archonship the victory at Marathon was won.</p>
          <p>VI. Of all the virtues of Aristeides his justice was that <lb/>
            which chiefly commended itself to the people, being that <lb/>
            which is of most value in ordinary life. Hence it was that <lb/>
            he, although a poor man of mean birth, yet gained for <lb/>
            himself the truly imperial title of the Just; a title which <lb/>
            has never been emulated by kings and despots, who delight <lb/>
            in being called the City-taker, the Thunderbolt, or the <lb/>
            Victorious, while some are known as the Eagle or the Hawk, <lb/>
            because apparently they prefer strength and lawless <lb/>
            violence to justice and goodness. Yet for all this, the gods, <lb/>
            to whom they so presumptuously liken themselves, excel <lb/>
            mankind chiefly in three attributes, namely in immortality, <lb/>
            in power, and in goodness, whereof goodness is by far the <lb/>
            most glorious and divine quality. Mere empty space, and <lb/>
            all the elements possess immortality, while earthquakes, <lb/>
            thunderbolts, violent winds and rushing waters have great <lb/>
            power, but justice and equity belong to the gods alone, <lb/>
            because of the reason and intelligence which they possess. <lb/>
            Now most men regard the gods with admiration, with fear, <lb/>
            and with reverence; with admiration, because they are <lb/>
            eternal and unchangeable; with fear, because of their <lb/>
            power and dominion, with reverence and love because of <lb/>
            their justice. Yet men covet immortality, which no flesh <lb/>
            can attain to; and also power, which depends mostly upon <lb/>
            fortune; while they disregard virtue, the only godlike <lb/>
            attribute which it is in our power to obtain; not reflecting <lb/>
            that when a man is in a position of great power and <lb/>
            authority he will appear like a god if he acts justly, and <lb/>
            like a wild beast if he does not.</p>
          <p>VII. The character of Aristeides for justice at first made <lb/>
            him beloved by the people, but afterwards it gained him <lb/>
            their ill-will, chiefly because Themistokles circulated reports <lb/>
            that Aristeides had practically closed the public courts of <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            justice by the fact of all cases being referred to him as <lb/>
            arbitrator, and that he was virtually king of Athens, <lb/>
            although he had not yet surrounded himself with a body­ <lb/>
            guard. By this time too the common people, elated with <lb/>
            their victory at Marathon, and thinking themselves capable <lb/>
            of the greatest exploits, were ill pleased at any private <lb/>
            citizen being exalted above the rest by his character and <lb/>
            virtues. They flocked into the city from all parts of the <lb/>
            country and ostracised Aristeides, veiling their envy of his <lb/>
            glory under the pretence that they feared he would make <lb/>
            himself king. This custom of ostracism was not intended <lb/>
            as a punishment for crime, but was called, in order to give <lb/>
            it a plausible title, a check to excessive power. In reality, <lb/>
            it was nothing more than a safety-valve, providing a vent <lb/>
            for the dislike felt by the people for those whose greatness <lb/>
            offended them. It did no irreparable injury to those who <lb/>
            fell under its operation, but only banished them for a space <lb/>
            of ten years. In later times mean and contemptible persons <lb/>
            were subjected to ostracism, until at last, after the ostracism <lb/>
            of Hyperbolus the practice was discontinued. The ostracism <lb/>
            of Hyperbolus is said to have been brought about in the <lb/>
            following manner. Alkibiades and Nikias, the two most <lb/>
            powerful citizens in the state, were at the head of two rival <lb/>
            parties. The people determined to apply the ostracism to <lb/>
            them, and would certainly have banished one or the other <lb/>
            of them. They, however, came to terms with one another, <lb/>
            combined their several factions, and agreed to have Hyper­ <lb/>
            bolus banished. The people, enraged at this, and thinking <lb/>
            that they had been treated with contempt, abolished the <lb/>
            practice of ostracism. The way in which it was conducted <lb/>
            was as follows. Each man took an oyster-shell, wrote upon <lb/>
            it the name of the citizen whom he wished to be banished, <lb/>
            and then carried it to a place in the market-place which <lb/>
            was fenced off with palings. The archons now first of all <lb/>
            counted the whole number of shells; for if the whole <lb/>
            number of voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism <lb/>
            was null and void. After this, they counted the number <lb/>
            of times each name occurred, and that man against whom <lb/>
            most votes were recorded they sent into exile for ten years, <lb/>
            allowing him the use of his property during that time. <lb/>
            Now while the shells were being written upon, on the <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            occasion of which we have been speaking, a very ignorant <lb/>
            country fellow is said to have brought his shell to Arts­ <lb/>
            teides, who was one of the bystanders, and to have asked <lb/>
            him to write upon it the name of Aristeides. Aristeides <lb/>
            was surprised, and asked him whether Aristeides had ever <lb/>
            done him any harm. “ No," answered the man, “ nor do I <lb/>
            know him by sight, but I am tired of always hearing him <lb/>
            called ‛ The Just.'" When Aristeides heard this he made <lb/>
            no answer, but wrote his name on the man's shell and gavo <lb/>
            it back to him. When he was leaving the city he raised <lb/>
            his hands to heaven, and prayed exactly the opposite prayer <lb/>
            to that of Achilles, that no crisis might befall the Athenians <lb/>
            which would compel them to remember Aristeides.</p>
          <p>VIII. However, three years afterwards, when Xerxes <lb/>
            was advancing upon Attica through Thessaly and Bœotia, <lb/>
            the Athenians annulled their decree, and permitted all <lb/>
            exiles to return, being especially afraid of Aristeides, lest <lb/>
            he should join the enemy and lead many of the citizens to <lb/>
            desert with him. In this they took a very false view of <lb/>
            his character, for even before this decree he had never <lb/>
            ceased to encourage the Greeks to defend their liberty, <lb/>
            and after his return, when Themistokles was in sole com­ <lb/>
            mand of the forces of Athens, he assisted him in every <lb/>
            way by word and deed, cheerfully raising his bitterest <lb/>
            enemy to the highest position in the state, because the <lb/>
            state was benefited thereby.</p>
          <p>When Eurybiades and his party were meditating a <lb/>
            retreat from Salamis, the Persian ships put to sea at night <lb/>
            and hemmed them in, surrounding both the strait and the <lb/>
            islands. No one knew that escape was impossible, but <lb/>
            Aristeides sailed from Ægina, passed safely through the <lb/>
            enemy's fleet by a miracle, and while it was still night <lb/>
            proceeded straight to the tent of Themistokles. Here he <lb/>
            called him out, and when they were alone together, he <lb/>
            said: “ Wo two, Themistokles, if we are wise, must cease <lb/>
            our vain and silly rivalry with one another, and begin a <lb/>
            more generous contest to preserve our country, you acting <lb/>
            as general and chief, while I help and advise you. Already <lb/>
            I perceive that you alone take a right view of the crisis, <lb/>
            and desire to fight a battle in the narrow waters as <lb/>
            quickly as possible. Now, while your allies have been <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            opposing you, the enemy have been playing your game, for <lb/>
            the sea, both in our front and rear, is full of their ships, <lb/>
            go that the Greeks even against their will must play the <lb/>
            man and fight; for no way of escape is left for them." <lb/>
            To this Themistokles answered, " 1 would not willingly, <lb/>
            Aristeides, be overcome by you in generosity on this <lb/>
            occasion ; and I shall endeavour, in emulation of this good <lb/>
            beginning which you have made, to surpass it by the <lb/>
            glory of my exploits." At the same time he explained <lb/>
            the trick * which he had played on the barbarian, and <lb/>
            begged Aristeides to argue with Eurybiades, and point <lb/>
            out how impossible it was for the Greeks to be saved <lb/>
            without fighting; for he thought that the opinion of <lb/>
            Aristeides would have more weight than his own. Con­ <lb/>
            sequently, when in the assembly of the generals Kleokritus <lb/>
            the Corinthian attacked Themistokles, and said that even <lb/>
            Aristeides did not approve of his plans, because he was <lb/>
            present and said nothing, Aristeides answered that he <lb/>
            would not have been silent if Themistokles had not spoken <lb/>
            to the purpose, but that as it was he held his peace, not <lb/>
            for any love he bore him, but because his counsel was the <lb/>
            best. ,</p>
          <p>IX. While the Greek admirals were engaged in these <lb/>
            discussions, Aristeides, perceiving that Psyttaleia, a small <lb/>
            island in the straits near Salamis, was full of the enemy, <lb/>
            placed some of the boldest Athenians on board of small <lb/>
            boats, attacked the Persians, and slew them to a man, <lb/>
            except a few of the chiefs, who were taken alive. Among <lb/>
            these were the three children of Sandauke the sister of <lb/>
            the Persian king, whom he at once sent to Themistokles, <lb/>
            and it is said that in accordance with some oracle they <lb/>
            were sacrificed to Dionysus Omestes,† at the instance of <lb/>
            the prophet Euphrantides. Aristeides now lined the <lb/>
            shores of the islet with soldiers, ready to receive any <lb/>
            vessel which might be cast upon it, in order that neither <lb/>
            any of his friends might be lost, nor any of the enemy <lb/>
            take refuge upon it. Indeed, the severest encounter bo­ <lb/>
            tween the two fleets and the main shook of the battle seems <note type="footnote"> * Alluding to the letter which he had sent to Xerxes. See Life of <lb/>
            Themistokles.’ </note><note type="footnote"> † See ‘ Life of Themistokles.’ </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            to have taken place at that spot; wherefore the trophy <lb/>
            that marks the victory stands on the isle of Psyttaleia.</p>
          <p>After the battle was won, Themistokles, wishing to feel <lb/>
            Aristeides's opinion, said to him that they had done a good <lb/>
            work, but that a greater one remained, which was to <lb/>
            shut up Asia in Europe by sailing as quickly as possible to <lb/>
            the Hellespont, and destroying the bridge of boats there. <lb/>
            Aristeides answered that he must never propose such a <lb/>
            plan, but must take measures to drive the Persians out of <lb/>
            Greece as quickly as possible, for fear that so great a <lb/>
            multitude, shut up there without the means of retreat, <lb/>
            should turn to bay and attack them with the courage of <lb/>
            despair. Upon this, Themistokles again sent the eunuch <lb/>
            Arnakes, a prisoner, on a secret errand to tell the Persian <lb/>
            king that when all the Greeks wished to sail to the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont and destroy the bridge of boats, he had dissuaded <lb/>
            them from doing so, wishing to save the king's life.</p>
          <p>X. At this Xerxes became terrified, and at once hurried <lb/>
            back to the Hellespont. Mardonius, with about three <lb/>
            hundred thousand of the best troops remained behind, and <lb/>
            was a formidable enemy, trusting in his land force, and <lb/>
            sending defiant proclamations to the Greeks. " You," he <lb/>
            said, " with your ships have beaten landsmen that knew not <lb/>
            how to handle an oar; but the land of Thessaly is wide, <lb/>
            and the plain of Bœotia is a fair place for good horsemen <lb/>
            and heavy armed soldiers to fight upon."</p>
          <p>To the Athenians he sent privately proposals from the <lb/>
            Great King, who offered to rebuild their city, present them <lb/>
            with a large sum of money, and make them lords over all <lb/>
            Greece, if they would desist from the war. The Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, hearing this, were much alarmed, and sent <lb/>
            ambassadors to beg the Athenians to send their wives and <lb/>
            children to Sparta, and offering to support their old people, <lb/>
            as the Athenians were in great distress for food, having <lb/>
            lost their city and their country. However, after listen­ <lb/>
            ing to the Lacedæmonian ambassadors, at the instance of <lb/>
            Aristeides they returned a spirited answer, saying that <lb/>
            they could forgive their enemies, who knew no better, for <lb/>
            supposing that everything could be bought with money, <lb/>
            but that they were angry with the Lacedaemonians for <lb/>
            only regarding the present poverty and distress of the <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            Athenians, and that forgetting how bravely they had <lb/>
            fought, they should now offer them food to bribe them to <lb/>
            fight for Greece. Having parsed this motion Aristeidea <lb/>
            called the ambassadors back into the assembly, and bade <lb/>
            them tell the Lacedæmonians that there was not as much <lb/>
            gold in the world, either above or under-ground, as the <lb/>
            Athenians would require to tempt them to betray Greece.</p>
          <p>In answer to the herald sent from Mardonius he pointed <lb/>
            to the sun, and said: “ As long as yonder sun shall con <lb/>
            tinue its course the Athenians will be enemies to the <lb/>
            Persians, because of their ravaged lands and desecrated <lb/>
            temples." Further, he made the priests imprecate curses <lb/>
            on any one who had dealings with the Persians or deserted <lb/>
            the Greek cause.</p>
          <p>When Mardonius invaded Attica a second time, the <lb/>
            Athenians again took refuge in Salamis. Aristeides was <lb/>
            sent to Lacedæmon and upbraided the Spartans with their <lb/>
            slowness and indifference, for allowing the enemy to take <lb/>
            Athens a second time, and begged them to help what <lb/>
            remained of Greece. The Ephors, on hearing this, pre­ <lb/>
            tended to pass the rest of the day in feasting and idleness, <lb/>
            for it was the festival of the Hyacinthia; but at night­ <lb/>
            fall they chose five thousand Spartans, each attended by <lb/>
            seven Helots, and sent them off without the knowledge <lb/>
            of the Athenian embassy. So when Aristeides next day <lb/>
            resumed his reproachful strain, they answered with mock­ <lb/>
            ing laughter, that he was talking nonsense and was asleep, <lb/>
            for that the army was by this time at the tomb of Orestes <lb/>
            in its march against the strangers * (by strangers they <lb/>
            meant the Persians). To this Aristeides answered that <lb/>
            it was a sorry jest to have deceived their friends instead <lb/>
            of their enemies. These particulars are related by Idomen­ <lb/>
            eus, but in the decree of Aristeides for sending ambassadors <lb/>
            it is not his name, but those of Kimon, Xanthippus, and <lb/>
            Myronides that are mentioned.</p>
          <p>XI. He was elected general with unlimited powers, and <lb/>
            proceeded to Platæa with eight thousand Athenians. <lb/>
            Here he was met by Pausanias, the commander-in-chief <lb/>
            of the Greek forces, with the Spartan contingent, and the <note type="footnote"> * So in Latin “ hostis " originally meant both a stranger and an <lb/>
            enemy. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            rest of the Greek troops joined them there. The Persian <lb/>
            army was encamped along the course of the river Asopua <lb/>
            On account of its enormous size it was not contained in a <lb/>
            fortified camp, but a quadrangular wall was constructed <lb/>
            round the baggage and most valuable material. Each <lb/>
            Bide of this square was ten furlongs in length.</p>
          <p>Tisamenus of Elis, the prophet, now told Pausanias and <lb/>
            all the Greeks that they would win the victory if they <lb/>
            stood on the defensive and did r ot attack. Aristeides sent <lb/>
            to Delphi, and received a response from the oracle, that <lb/>
            the Athenians would conquer if they prayed to Zeus, to <lb/>
            Hera of Kithæron, and to Pan and the nymphs Sphragi­ <lb/>
            tides, and if they sacrificed to the heroes Androkrates, <lb/>
            Leukon, Peisander, Damokrates, Hypsion, Aktaion, and <lb/>
            Polyidus, and if they would fight in their own territory, <lb/>
            in the plain of Demeter of Eleusis and her daughter.</p>
          <p>This oracle greatly disturbed Aristeides. The heroes <lb/>
            to whom he was bidden to sacrifice are the original <lb/>
            founders of the city of Platæa, and the cave of the <lb/>
            nymphs called Sphragitides, is on one of the peaks of Kith­ <lb/>
            æron, looking towards the point where the sun sets in <lb/>
            summer. It is said that there was formerly an oracle <lb/>
            there, and that many of the people became possessed, <lb/>
            and were called " nympholeptæ.” But as to the plain of <lb/>
            the Eleusinian Demeter, and the promise of victory to the <lb/>
            Athenians if they fought in their own country, this meant <lb/>
            no less than to recall them to Attica and forbid their <lb/>
            taking any further part in the war. Whilst Aristeides <lb/>
            was thus perplexed, Arimnestus, the general of the Pla­ <lb/>
            tæans, saw a vision in his sleep. In his dreams he thought <lb/>
            that Zeus the Preserver appeared and enquired of him <lb/>
            what the Greeks had decided to do, and that he answered, <lb/>
            “ Lord, to-morrow we shall lead away the army to Eleusis, <lb/>
            and fight the Persians there, according to the oracle." <lb/>
            Upon this the god answered, that they had missed the <lb/>
            meaning of the oracle, for the places mentioned were <lb/>
            near Platæa, where they themselves were encamped, and <lb/>
            if they sought they would find them. Arimnestus, after <lb/>
            this distinct vision, awoke. He at once sent for the <lb/>
            oldest and most learned of the citizens of Platæa, and <lb/>
            after debating the matter with them, discovered that near <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            Hysiae, under Mount Kithæron, stood a very ancient temple, <lb/>
            dedicated to the Eleusinian Demeter and her daughter. <lb/>
            He immediately took Aristeides with him and proceeded <lb/>
            to the spot, which was excellently placed for the array <lb/>
            of an infantry force in the presence of an overwhelming <lb/>
            cavalry, because the spurs of Mount Kithæron, where <lb/>
            they run down into the plain by the temple, render the <lb/>
            ground impassable for cavalry. Close by is the chapel of <lb/>
            the hero Androkrates, in the midst of a thick matted <lb/>
            grove of trees. In order, however, that the oracle might <lb/>
            in no way be defective in its promise of victory, Arimnes­ <lb/>
            tus proposed, and the Platæans decreed, that the boundary <lb/>
            marks of their territory on the side towards Attica should <lb/>
            be removed, and the country given to the Athenians, so <lb/>
            that they might fight in their own land for Greece, accord­ <lb/>
            to the oracle. This noble act of the Platæans became so <lb/>
            famous in later times, that, many years afterwards, <lb/>
            Alexander the Great himself, when he had conquered all <lb/>
            Asia, caused the walls of Platæa to be rebuilt, and made <lb/>
            proclamation at the Olympian games by a herald, “ that <lb/>
            the king bestowed this honour upon the Platæans in <lb/>
            memory of their magnanimous conduct in giving up their <lb/>
            territory, and venturing their lives on behalf of the Greeks <lb/>
            in the Persian war."</p>
          <p>XII. A controversy arose between the Athenians and <lb/>
            the men of Tegea about their respective places in the <lb/>
            line of battle. The Tegeans argued that if the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians had the light wing, they ought to be posted on <lb/>
            the left; and they spoke at great length about the achieve­ <lb/>
            ments of their ancestors, as entitling them to that honour. <lb/>
            The Athenians were vexed at their pretensions, but Aris­ <lb/>
            teides said : “ The present time is not suitable for disput­ <lb/>
            ing with the Tegeans about bravery; but to you, men of <lb/>
            Sparta, and to the rest of the Greeks, we say that a <lb/>
            particular post neither confers courage nor takes it away , <lb/>
            but, that in whatever part of the line you may think fit <lb/>
            to place us, we will endeavour so to array our ranks and <lb/>
            fight the enemy as not to impair the honour which we <lb/>
            have gained in former battles. We did not come hither <lb/>
            to quarrel with our allies, but to fight the enemy; not to <lb/>
            boast about our ancestors, but to fight bravely for Greece. <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            The coming struggle will clearly show to all the Greeks <lb/>
            the real worth and value of each city, each general, and <lb/>
            each single citizen." When the council of generals heard <lb/>
            this speech, they allowed the claim of the Athenians, and <lb/>
            gave up the left wing to them.</p>
          <p>XIII. While the cause of Greece was thus trembling in <lb/>
            the balance, and Athens was especially in danger, certain <lb/>
            Athenians of noble birth, who had lost their former wealth <lb/>
            during the war, and with it their influence in the city, <lb/>
            being unable to bear to see others exalted at their expense, <lb/>
            met in secret in a house in Plateea and entered into a plot <lb/>
            to overturn the free constitution of Athens. If they <lb/>
            could not succeed in this, they pledged themselves to ruin <lb/>
            the city and betray it to the Persians. While these men <lb/>
            were plotting in the camp, and bringing many over to <lb/>
            their side, Aristeides discovered the whole conspiracy. <lb/>
            Afraid at such a crisis to take any decisive step, he <lb/>
            determined, while carefully watching the conspirators, yet <lb/>
            not at once to seize them all, not knowing how far he <lb/>
            might have to proceed if he acted according to strict <lb/>
            justice. From all the conspirators he arrested eight. <lb/>
            Two of these, who would have been the first to be put on <lb/>
            their trial, Æschines of Lampra, and Agesias of Acharnæ, <lb/>
            made their escape out of the camp, and Aristeides pardoned <lb/>
            the others, as he wished to give an opportunity to those <lb/>
            who believed themselves unsuspected, to take courage and <lb/>
            repent. He also hinted to them that the war afforded <lb/>
            them a means of clearing themselves from any suspicion <lb/>
            of disloyalty by fighting for their country like good men <lb/>
            and true.</p>
          <p>XIV. After this, Mardonius made trial of Grecian <lb/>
            courage, by sending the whole of his cavalry, in which <lb/>
            he was much the stronger, to attack them where they were, <lb/>
            all except the Megarians, encamped at the foot of Mount <lb/>
            Kithæron, in an easily-defended rocky country. These <lb/>
            men, three thousand in number, were encamped nearer <lb/>
            the plain, and suffered much from the attacks of the <lb/>
            horsemen, who surrounded them on all sides. They sent <lb/>
            a mebsenger in great haste to Pausanias, begging him to <lb/>
            send assistance, as they could not by themselves resist the <lb/>
            great numbers of the barbarians. Pausanias, hearing this, <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            and seeing the camp of the Megarians overwhelmed with <lb/>
            darts and arrows, while the defenders were huddled <lb/>
            together in a narrow compass, knew not what to do. He <lb/>
            did not venture to attack cavalry with the heavy-armed <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian infantry, but offered it as an opportunity for <lb/>
            winning praise and honour, to the generals who were with <lb/>
            him, that they should volunteer to go to help the Mega­ <lb/>
            rians in their extremity. All hesitated, but Aristcides <lb/>
            claimed the honour for the Athenians, and sent the bravest <lb/>
            of his captains, Olympiodorus, with three hundred picked <lb/>
            men, besides some archers. As they quickly got into <lb/>
            array and charged at a run, Masistius, the leader of the <lb/>
            enemy, a man of great bodily strength and beauty, seeing <lb/>
            them, wheeled round his horse, and rode to attack them. <lb/>
            They sustained his attack and closed with his horsemen, <lb/>
            and a sharp struggle took place, both parties fighting as <lb/>
            though the issue of the war depended on their exertions. <lb/>
            The horse of Masistius was at length wounded by an <lb/>
            arrow and threw his rider. Encumbered by his armour, <lb/>
            Masistius was too heavy for his own men to carry him <lb/>
            away, but also was protected by it from the stabs of the <lb/>
            Athenians who fell upon him, for not only his head <lb/>
            and breast, but his limbs also were protected by brass <lb/>
            and iron. Some one, however, drove the spike at the <lb/>
            lower end of his spear through the eye-hole of the helmet, <lb/>
            and then the rest of the Persians abandoned the body and <lb/>
            fled. The Greeks discovered the importance of their <lb/>
            exploit, not from the number of the dead, for but few had <lb/>
            fallen, but from the lamentations of the enemy. They <lb/>
            cut off their own hair, and the manes of their horses and <lb/>
            mules, in sign of mourning for Masistius, and filled the <lb/>
            whole plain with weeping and wailing, having lost a man <lb/>
            who for courage and high position, was second only to <lb/>
            Mardonius himself.</p>
          <p>XV. After this cavalry action, both the parties remained <lb/>
            quiet for a long time, for the soothsayers foretold victory <lb/>
            both to the Greeks and to the Persians if they fought in <lb/>
            self-defence, but foretold defeat if they attacked. At <lb/>
            length Mardonius, as he only had provisions for a few <lb/>
            days longer, and as the Greek army kept growing stronger <lb/>
            by the continual reinforcements which it received, deter­ <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            mined, sorely against his will, to delay no longer, but to <lb/>
            cross the Asopus at daybreak and fall upon the Greeks <lb/>
            unexpectedly. In the evening he gave orders to his <lb/>
            captains to this effect. About midnight a solitary horse­ <lb/>
            man rode up straight to the Greek camp. He bade the <lb/>
            guard send for Aristeides the Athenian, who was at once <lb/>
            brought, when the stranger spoke as follows :</p>
          <p>" I am Alexander of Macedon, and I have come hither <lb/>
            at the greatest risk to myself to do you a service, for fear <lb/>
            you should be taken by surprise. Mardonius will attack <lb/>
            to-morrow, not because he has any new hope of success, <lb/>
            but because he is destitute of provisions, although the <lb/>
            soothsayers all forbid him to fight because the sacrifices <lb/>
            and oracles are unfavourable, and the army is disheartened. <lb/>
            Thus he is forced to put all on a venture, or else to starve <lb/>
            if he remains quiet." When he had said this, Alexander <lb/>
            begged Aristeides to keep the secret to himself, and <lb/>
            communicate it to no one else. Aristeides, however, <lb/>
            answered that it would not be right for him to conceal it <lb/>
            from Pausanias, who was commander-in chief. Before the <lb/>
            battle he said that he would keep it secret from every <lb/>
            one else, but that if Greece was victorious, all men then <lb/>
            should know the good service so bravely rendered by <lb/>
            Alexander. After these words the king of Macedon rode <lb/>
            away, and Aristeides, proceeding to the tent of Pausanias, <lb/>
            told him the whole matter; they then sent for the other <lb/>
            generals, and ordered them to keep the troops under <lb/>
            arms, as a battle was expected.</p>
          <p>XVI. At this time, Herodotus tells us, Pausanias asked <lb/>
            Aristeides to remove the Athenians from the left to the <lb/>
            right wing, so as to be opposite to the native Persian <lb/>
            troops, on the ground that they would be better able to <lb/>
            contend with them, because they understood their mode of <lb/>
            fighting, and were confident because they had beaten <lb/>
            them once before, while he with the Spartans would take <lb/>
            the left wing of the army, where he would be opposed to <lb/>
            those Greeks who had taken the Persian side. Most of <lb/>
            the Athenian generals thought this a silly and insolent <lb/>
            proceeding of Pausanias, that he should leave all the other <lb/>
            Greeks in their place, and march them backwards and <lb/>
            forward like holots, only to place them opposite the <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            bravest troops of the enemy. Aristeides, however, said that <lb/>
            they were entirely mistaken, for a few days before they <lb/>
            had been wrangling with the Tegeans for the honour of <lb/>
            being posted on the left wing, and had been delighted <lb/>
            when they obtained it; but now, when the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            of their own free will yielded the right wing to them, and <lb/>
            in some sort offered them the post of honour in the whole <lb/>
            army, they were not delighted at it, and did not consider <lb/>
            what an advantage it was to have to fight against foreign <lb/>
            barbarians, and not against men of their own race and <lb/>
            nation. After these words, the Athenians cheerfully <lb/>
            exchanged places with the Lacedæmonians, and much <lb/>
            talk went on among them as each man reminded his <lb/>
            comrades that the Persians who would come to attack <lb/>
            them were no braver, nor better armed than those <lb/>
            whom they had defeated at Marathon, but that they had <lb/>
            the same bows and arrows, the same embroidered robes <lb/>
            and gold ornaments on their effeminate bodies, while we, <lb/>
            they said, have arms and bodies such as we had then, and <lb/>
            greater confidence because of our victories. We also fight, <lb/>
            not merely as other Greeks do, in defence of our city and <lb/>
            territory, but for the trophies of Marathon and Salamis, <lb/>
            lest the battle of Marathon should be thought to have <lb/>
            been won more by Miltiades and Fortune, than by the <lb/>
            valour of the Athenians. With such encouraging talk <lb/>
            as this the Athenians took up their new position; but <lb/>
            the Thebans discovered what had been done from deserters <lb/>
            and told Mardonius. He at once, either from fear of the <lb/>
            Athenians, or from a chivalrous wish to fight the Spartans <lb/>
            himself, led the native Persian troops to his right wing, <lb/>
            and ordered the renegade Greeks to take ground opposite <lb/>
            the Athenians. When these changes were being observed, <lb/>
            Pausanias returned to his original position on the right. <lb/>
            Mardonius then returned to the left as before, and the <lb/>
            day passed without an engagement. The Greeks now <lb/>
            determined in a council of war, to remove their camp to a <lb/>
            place farther away and better supplied with water, because <lb/>
            they were prevented from using the springs near where <lb/>
            they were by the enemy's great superiority in cavalry.</p>
          <p>XVII. When night fell the generals began to lead the <lb/>
            army to the place selected for a new camp. The soldiers <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            were very unwilling to follow them thither and keep <lb/>
            together in a body, but as soon as they quitted their first <lb/>
            entrenchments, most of them made for the city of Platæa ; <lb/>
            and there was much confusion as they wandered about <lb/>
            and pitched their tents here and there. The Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, much against their will, chanced to be left behind, <lb/>
            and quite separated from the rest. One Amompharetus, <lb/>
            at spirited and daring man, who had long been eager to <lb/>
            fight, and chafed much at the long delays and counter- <lb/>
            marches which had taken place, now cried aloud that this <lb/>
            change of position was no better than a cowardly flight. <lb/>
            He refused to leave his post, and said that he and his <lb/>
            company would stand where they were, and withstand <lb/>
            Mardonius alone. When Pausanias came and assured <lb/>
            him that the Greeks in council had decided upon this <lb/>
            measure, Amompharetus heaved up a huge stone with <lb/>
            both his hands and flinging it down at the feet of Pausanias, <lb/>
            said, " With this pebble I give my vote for battle, and <lb/>
            for disregarding the cowardly counsels of other Greeks." <lb/>
            Pausanias, not knowing what to do, sent to the Athenians, <lb/>
            who were already on the march, begging them to wait <lb/>
            and support them, while he set off with the rest of the <lb/>
            Spartans in the direction of Platæa, hoping thus to make <lb/>
            Amompharetus move.</p>
          <p>While these movements were being executed day broke, <lb/>
            and Mardonius, who had perceived that the Greeks were <lb/>
            leaving their camp, at once marched in order of battle <lb/>
            to attack the Lacedæmonians, the Persians shouting and <lb/>
            clattering their arms as though they were not going to <lb/>
            fight, but to destroy the Greeks as they retreated, which <lb/>
            indeed they very nearly succeeded in doing; for Pausanias, <lb/>
            when he saw what was taking place, halted his own men, <lb/>
            and placed them in battle array, but either because of his <lb/>
            anger at Amompharetus, or his excitement at the sudden­ <lb/>
            ness of the attack, forgot to send any orders to the main <lb/>
            body of the Greeks.</p>
          <p>For this reason they came up not in a regular body, but <lb/>
            straggling, and after the Lacedæmonians were already <lb/>
            engaged. Pausanias was busy sacrificing to the gods, and <lb/>
            as the sacrifices were unfavourable, he ordered the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians to hold their shields quietly rested on the <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            ground at their feet and await his orders, without attempt­ <lb/>
            ing any resistance, while he sacrificed again. The <lb/>
            enemy's cavalry was now close at hand, their arrows <lb/>
            reached the Lacedæmonians and killed several of them. <lb/>
            It was at this moment that Kallikrates, the tallest and <lb/>
            handsomest man in the whole Greek army, is said to have <lb/>
            been mortally wounded by an arrow. When dying, he <lb/>
            said that he did not lament his death, for he left his <lb/>
            home meaning to lay down his life for Greece, but that <lb/>
            he was grieved that he had never exchanged blows <lb/>
            with the enemy before he died. At this time the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians were offering no resistance to the <lb/>
            assaults of the enemy, but were standing still in their <lb/>
            ranks, shot at by the arrows of the enemy, awaiting the <lb/>
            time when it should be the will of the gods and their <lb/>
            general that they should fight. Some writers tell us that <lb/>
            while Pausanias was offering sacrifice and prayer a little <lb/>
            beyond the ranks, some Lydians suddenly fell upon him, <lb/>
            and began to plunder the sacrificial vessels, but that <lb/>
            Pausanias, and those with him, having no arms, drove <lb/>
            them away with sticks and whips ; in memory of which <lb/>
            they beat young men on the altar at Sparta at the present <lb/>
            day, and afterwards lead what is called the Lydian pro­ <lb/>
            cession.</p>
          <p>X V III. Pausanias was deeply grieved at what was taking <lb/>
            place, seeing the priests offering sacrifice after sacrifice, <lb/>
            not one of which pleased the gods; at last he turned his <lb/>
            eyes towards the temple of Hera and wept. Holding up <lb/>
            his hands he besought Hera of Mount Kithæron and all <lb/>
            the other gods of the land of Platæa that if it were not <lb/>
            the will of the gods that the Greeks should conquer, they <lb/>
            might at any rate do some valorous deed before they died, <lb/>
            and let their conquerors know that they had fought with <lb/>
            brave and experienced warriors. When Pausanias prayed <lb/>
            thus, the sacrifices at once became favourable and the <lb/>
            soothsayers prophesied victory. The word was given to <lb/>
            set themselves in order of battle, and then at cnce the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonian force resembled some fierce beast turning <lb/>
            to bay and setting up his bristles, while the barbarians <lb/>
            saw that they had to deal with men who were prepared <lb/>
            to fight to the death. Wherefore they set up their great <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            wicker shields in front of them, and from this shelter <lb/>
            shot their arrows at the Lacedæmonians. But the latter <lb/>
            advanced without breaking their ranks, overturned the <lb/>
            line of wicker shields, and with terrible thrusts of <lb/>
            their spears at the faces and breasts of the Persians, <lb/>
            laid many of them low by their fierce and well-dis­ <lb/>
            ciplined charge. The Persians too fought bravely, and <lb/>
            resisted for a long while, laying hold of the spears with <lb/>
            their bare hands and breaking most of them in that <lb/>
            manner, fighting hand to hand, with their scimitars and <lb/>
            axes, and tearing the Lacedæmonians' shields out of their <lb/>
            hands by force.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the Athenians had for a long time stood <lb/>
            quietly awaiting the Lacedæmonians. When, however, <lb/>
            they heard the shouting and noise of the battle, and a <lb/>
            messenger, it is said, reached them from Pausanias, they <lb/>
            marched with all speed to help him. As they were hurry­ <lb/>
            ing over the plain to where the shouts were heard, the <lb/>
            Greeks who had taken the Persian side attacked them. <lb/>
            At first when Aristeides saw them, he ran out far before <lb/>
            the rest and besought them in a loud voice in the name of <lb/>
            the gods of Greece not to hinder the Athenians when they <lb/>
            were going to assist those who were venturing their lives <lb/>
            on behalf of Greece. But when he saw that they took no <lb/>
            notice of his appeal, he no longer attempted to help the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, but attacked these troops, who numbered <lb/>
            about fifty thousand. Of these the greater part gave way <lb/>
            at once and retreated, because they saw their barbarian <lb/>
            allies retreating, but a fierce battle is said to have raged <lb/>
            where the Thebans were, because the best and noblest <lb/>
            men of that state had eagerly taken the Persian side from <lb/>
            the beginning, while the common people followed them, not <lb/>
            of their free will, but being accustomed to obey the nobles.</p>
          <p>XIX. Thus was the battle divided into two parts. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians were the first to rout the Persians. A <lb/>
            Spartan, named Arimnestus, killed Mardonius by a blow <lb/>
            on the head with a stone, as the oracle in the temple of <lb/>
            Amphiaraus had foretold to him. For Mardonius sent a <lb/>
            Lydian thither, and another man, a Karian, to the oracle in <lb/>
            the cave of Trophonius. This latter was spoken to in the <lb/>
            Karian language by the prophet, but the other slept in the <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            sacred enclosure round the temple of Amphiaraus, and in <lb/>
            his dreams saw a servant of the god standing beside him <lb/>
            and bidding him legone. When he refused to go, the <lb/>
            figure cast a great stone at his head, so that he dreamed <lb/>
            that he died of the stroke. This is the story which is told <lb/>
            of Mardonius. The Persian fugitives were now driven <lb/>
            to take shelter within their wooden fortification. Shortly <lb/>
            after these events took place, the Athenians defeated the <lb/>
            Thebans, who lost three hundred of their noblest citizens <lb/>
            in that battle. After this there came a messenger to them, <lb/>
            telling them that the Persians were being besieged in <lb/>
            their fortified camp. Hearing this, the Athenians allowed <lb/>
            the renegade Greeks to escape, and marched at once to the <lb/>
            assault of the camp. Here they found the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            who were not pressing the enemy, because they had no <lb/>
            experience in sieges and attacks on fortified places. The <lb/>
            Athenians forced their way in and took the camp with an <lb/>
            immense slaughter of the enemy. It is said that out of <lb/>
            three hundred thousand only forty thousand under Arta­ <lb/>
            bazus escaped. On the side of the Greeks fell only thirteen <lb/>
            hundred and sixty men. Of these there were fifty-two <lb/>
            Athenians of the Aiantid tribe,. which, we are told by <lb/>
            Kleidemus, distinguished itself beyond all others on that <lb/>
            day. For this reason, the Aiantid tribe offered the sacrifice <lb/>
            to the nymphs Sphragitides, ordered by the oracle for the <lb/>
            victory, at the public expense. Of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            there fell ninety-one, and of the Tegeans sixteen. It is <lb/>
            hard, therefore, to understand Herodotus when he says <lb/>
            that these alone came to blows with the enemy, and that <lb/>
            no other Greeks were engaged at all; for both the number <lb/>
            of the slain and the tombs of the fallen prove that the <lb/>
            victory was won by all the Greeks together. If only <lb/>
            three cities had fought, and the rest had done nothing, <lb/>
            they never would have inscribed on the altar: <lb/>
            “ The Greeks in battle drove the Persian forth <lb/>
            By force of arms, and bravely Greece set free, <lb/>
            To Zeus Protector they this altar reared, <lb/>
            Where all might thank him for their victory."</p>
          <p>This battle was fought on the day of the month Boed­ <note type="footnote"> * These men traced their descent to the Homeric Ajax. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            romion, according to the Athenian calendar; and on the <lb/>
            twenty-sixth of the month Panemus according to that of <lb/>
            the Boeotians, on which day the Hellenic meeting still <lb/>
            takes place at Platæa, and sacrifice is offered to Zeus, the <lb/>
            Protector of Liberty, in memory of this victory. The <lb/>
            discrepancy of the dates is no marvel, seeing that even <lb/>
            at the present day, when astronomy is more accurately <lb/>
            understood, different cities still begin and end their months <lb/>
            on different days.</p>
          <p>XX. After the battle, as the Athenians would not <lb/>
            assign the prize of valour * to the Lacedæmonians, nor suffer <lb/>
            them to set up a trophy, the common cause of Greece was <lb/>
            within a little of being ruined by the quarrels of the two <lb/>
            armies, had not Aristeides by argument and entreaty <lb/>
            prevailed upon his colleagues, especially Leokrates and <lb/>
            Myronides, to submit the dispute to the decision of all <lb/>
            the Greeks. Upon this a council was held, at which <lb/>
            Theogeiton of Megara said that the prize for valour ought <lb/>
            to be given to another city, and not either to Athens or <lb/>
            Sparta, if they did not wish to bring about a civil war. <lb/>
            To this Kleokritus of Corinth made answer. All men <lb/>
            expected that he would demand the honour for Corinth, <lb/>
            which city had acquitted itself best, next to Athens and <lb/>
            Sparta; but he made a very excellent and conciliatory <lb/>
            speech, demanding that the prize should be bestowed on <lb/>
            the Platæans, by which means neither of the claimants <lb/>
            would be aggrieved. This proposal was agreed to by <lb/>
            Aristeides on behalf of the Athenians, and by Pausanias <lb/>
            on behalf of the Lacedæmonians. Having thus settled <lb/>
            their differences, they set apart from the plunder eighty <lb/>
            talents for the Platæans, with which they built the temple <lb/>
            of Athena, and the shrine, and also decorated the temple <lb/>
            with paintings, which even to this present day retain <lb/>
            their lustre. The Lacedæmonians set up a trophy for <lb/>
            themselves, and the Athenians another one apart. When <lb/>
            they enquired at Delphi what sacrifice was to be offered, <lb/>
            the oracle bade them set up an altar to Zeus the Protector <lb/>
            of the Free, and not to sacrifice upon it until they had <lb/>
            first put out all fires throughout the country, because it <note type="footnote"> * This was always given before the equal division of the plunder <lb/>
            took place. Cf. Virgo An. IX. 268, sqq. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            had been defiled by the presence of the barbarian, and <lb/>
            had then fetched a new fire pure from pollution, from the <lb/>
            the hearth at Delphi, which is common to all Greece. The <lb/>
            chiefs of the Greeks at once proceeded throughout the <lb/>
            Platæan territory, forcing every one to extinguish his <lb/>
            fire, even in the case of funeral piles, while Euchidas of <lb/>
            Platæa, who promised that he would fetch fire as quickly <lb/>
            as possible, proceeded to Delphi. There he purified his <lb/>
            body, and having been besprinkled with holy water and <lb/>
            crowned with laurel, took fire from the altar, set off <lb/>
            running back to Platæa, and arrived there about sunset, <lb/>
            having run a distance of a hundred and twenty-five <lb/>
            miles in one day. He embraced his fellow citizens, <lb/>
            handed the fire to them, fell down, and in a few moments <lb/>
            died. The Platæans, to show their admiration of him, <lb/>
            buried him in the temple of Artemis Eukleia, with this <lb/>
            inscription on his tomb: <lb/>
            “ Euchidas rail to Delphi and back again in one day."</p>
          <p>As for Eukleia, most persons believe her to be Artemis, <lb/>
            and worship her as that goddess ; but some say that she <lb/>
            was a daughter of Herakles and Myrto, the daughter of <lb/>
            Mencetius, who was the sister of Patroklus, and who, <lb/>
            dying a virgin, is worshipped by the Boeotians and <lb/>
            Lokrians. An altar and image of her stands in every <lb/>
            market-place in these countries, and those who are about <lb/>
            to marry, sacrifice to her.</p>
          <p>XXI. After this Aristeides proposed at a general <lb/>
            assembly of all the Greeks, that all the cities of Greece <lb/>
            should every year send deputies and religious representa­ <lb/>
            tives to the city of Platæa, and that every fifth year <lb/>
            Eleutheria, or a festival in honour of Freedom, should be <lb/>
            celebrated there. Also he proposed that there should be <lb/>
            a general levy throughout Greece, for the war against the <lb/>
            Persians, of ten thousand heavy armed troops, a thousand <lb/>
            horse, and a hundred ships of war; and that the Platæans <lb/>
            should be held inviolable, and consecrated to the service <lb/>
            of the gods, to whom they offered sacrifice on behalf of <lb/>
            all Greece. These things were ratified, and the people <lb/>
            of Platæa undertook to make yearly sacrifices in honour <lb/>
            of those who had fallen fighting for Greece, and whose <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            bodies were buried there. This they perform even at the <lb/>
            present day in the following fashion. On the sixteenth <lb/>
            day of the month Maimakterion, which in the <unclear>Bœoti</unclear> <lb/>
            calendar is called Alalkomenius, they make a procession <lb/>
            headed by a trumpeter sounding the charge. After him <lb/>
            follow waggons full of myrtle and garlands of flowers, <lb/>
            a black bull, libations of wine and milk in jars, and <lb/>
            earthenware vessels full of oil and perfume. These are <lb/>
            carried by young men of noble birth, for no slave is <lb/>
            allowed to take any part in the proceedings, because the <lb/>
            men in whose honour the sacrifice is made, died fighting <lb/>
            for liberty. Last of all comes the chief magistrate of <lb/>
            Platæa, who, during the rest of his term of office, is not <lb/>
            allowed to touch iron, or to wear clothes of any colour <lb/>
            but white. On this day, however, he wears a scarlet <lb/>
            tunic, takes an urn* from the public record office in one <lb/>
            hand, and a sword in the other, and proceeds through the <lb/>
            middle of the city to the sepulchres. There he with <lb/>
            his own hands draws water from the well, washes the <lb/>
            head-stones of the graves, and anoints them with oil. <lb/>
            After this he cuts the throat of the bull, places his bones <lb/>
            on a funeral pile, and with prayer to Zeus, and Hermes <lb/>
            who conducts men's souls into the nether world, he calls <lb/>
            on the brave men who died for Greece, to come to the <lb/>
            feast and drink the libations of blood. Next he mixes a <lb/>
            large bowl of wine and water, pours out a cup for himself, <lb/>
            and says, " I drink to those who died in defence of the <lb/>
            freedom of Greece." This custom is observed even to this <lb/>
            day by the Platæans.</p>
          <p>XXII. After the return of the Athenians to their own <lb/>
            city, Aristeides observed that they desired to adopt a demo­ <lb/>
            cratic form of government. As he considered that the people <lb/>
            had by their bravery deserved a share in the management <lb/>
            of affairs, and likewise thought that it would be hard to <lb/>
            turn them from their purpose as they had arms in their <lb/>
            hands, and were confident in their strength because of the <note type="footnote"> * Whether a cinerary urn for the ashes of the dead, or a water-pot <lb/>
            for drawing water is meant, I am unable to determine. Clough takes <lb/>
            the latter meaning, which is borne out by the context. On the other <lb/>
            hand the Greek word is used by Plutarch (‘ Life of Philopœmen,’ <lb/>
            ch. xxL) in the sense of an um to contain the askes of the dead. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            victories which they had won, he carried a decree that <lb/>
            every citizen should have a share in the government, and <lb/>
            that the archons should be chosen out of the whole body <lb/>
            of Athenians.</p>
          <p>When Themistokles told the Athenian assembly that he <lb/>
            had in his mind a proposition most valuable to the state, <lb/>
            which nevertheless could not be openly discussed, the <lb/>
            people bade Aristeides alone listen to what it was and <lb/>
            give his opinion upon it. Then Themistokles told Aris­ <lb/>
            teides, that he meditated burning the entire fleet of the <lb/>
            Greeks, as they lay drawn up on the beach, as by this <lb/>
            means Athens would become the greatest state in Greece, <lb/>
            and mistress of all the others. Aristeides, on hearing this, <lb/>
            came forward to the assembly and said that the proposal <lb/>
            of Themistokles, although most advantageous, was yet <lb/>
            most wicked and unjust. When the people heard this, <lb/>
            they forbade Themistokles to prosecute his design. So <lb/>
            highly did the Athenians prize justice, and so well and <lb/>
            faithfully did Aristeides serve them.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Being sent as general, with Kimon as his <lb/>
            colleague, to the war with Persia, he perceived that <lb/>
            Pausanias and the other Spartan generals were harsh and <lb/>
            insolent to their allies; and he himself, by treating them <lb/>
            with kindness and consideration, aided by the gentle and <lb/>
            kindly temper shown by Kimon in the campaign, gradually <lb/>
            obtained supreme authority over them, not having won it <lb/>
            by arms or fleets, but by courtesy and wise policy. The <lb/>
            Athenians, already beloved by the Greeks, on account of <lb/>
            the justice of Aristeides and the kindliness of Kimon, <lb/>
            were much more endeared to them by the insolent brutal­ <lb/>
            ity of Pausanias, who always spoke roughly and angrily <lb/>
            to the chiefs of the various contingents of allies, and used <lb/>
            to punish the common men by stripes, or by forcing them <lb/>
            to stand all day with a heavy iron anchor on their <lb/>
            shoulders. No one was permitted to obtain straw or <lb/>
            forage for their horses, or to draw water from a well <lb/>
            before the Spartans had helped themselves, and servants <lb/>
            were placed with whips to drive away any who attempted <lb/>
            to do so. Aristeides once endeavoured to complain of this <lb/>
            to Pausanias, but he knitting his brows, rudely told him <lb/>
            that he was not at leisure, and took no notice of his words. <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            ' this the generals and admirals of the Greek states, <lb/>
            especially those from Chios, Samoa, and Lesbos, besought <lb/>
            Aristeides to make himself commander-in-chief, and rally <lb/>
            round him all the allied cities, who had long desired to <lb/>
            get rid of the Spartan supremacy and to take the side <lb/>
            of Athens. He answered that he admitted the justice and <lb/>
            even the necessity of their proposals, but that they must <lb/>
            prove themselves to be in earnest by some act which would <lb/>
            make it impossible for the great body of them to draw <lb/>
            back. Upon this, Ouliades of Samos, and Antagoras of <lb/>
            Chios conspired together, and off Byzantium, they ran on <lb/>
            board of the ship of Pausanias, which was sailing before <lb/>
            the rest. He on seeing this, rose up in a rage and threat­ <lb/>
            ened that in a short time he would let them know that <lb/>
            they had not endangered his ship, but their own native <lb/>
            cities. They in answer bade him go his way and be <lb/>
            thankful for the victory at Platæa won under his command, <lb/>
            for that it was which alone restrained the Greeks from <lb/>
            dealing with him as he deserved. Finally they left him, <lb/>
            and sailed away to join the Athenian ships. On this <lb/>
            occasion the magnanimous conduct of the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            deserves high praise. When they perceived that the <lb/>
            heads of their generals were being turned by the greatness <lb/>
            of their power, they of their own accord withdrew from <lb/>
            the supreme power, and no longer sent any generals to <lb/>
            the wars, choosing rather to have moderate citizens who <lb/>
            would abide by their laws at home, than to bear rule over <lb/>
            the whole of Greece.</p>
          <p>Even while the Lacedæmonians remained in command, <lb/>
            the Greeks paid a certain contribution to pay the expenses <lb/>
            of the war; and as they wished each city to be assessed <lb/>
            to pay a reasonable sum, they asked the Athenians to <lb/>
            appoint Aristeides to visit each city, learn the extent of <lb/>
            its territory and revenues, and fix upon the amount which <lb/>
            each was capable of contributing according to its means. <lb/>
            Although he was in possession of such a power as this­ <lb/>
            the whole of Greece having as it were given itself up to <lb/>
            be dealt with at his discretion-yet he laid down his office <lb/>
            a poorer man than when he accepted it, but having com­ <lb/>
            pleted his assessment to the satisfaction of all. As the <lb/>
            ancients used to tell of the blessedness of the golden age, <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            even so did the states of Greece honour the assessment <lb/>
            made by Aristeides, calling the time when it was made, <lb/>
            fortunate and blessed for Greece, especially when no long <lb/>
            time afterwards it was doubled, and subsequently trebled. <lb/>
            The money which Aristeides proposed to raise amounted <lb/>
            to four hundred and sixty talents; to which Perikles added <lb/>
            nearly a third part, for Thucydides tells us that at the <lb/>
            commencement of the Peloponnesian war, the Athenians <lb/>
            received six hundred talents a year from their allies. <lb/>
            After the death of Perikles, the popular orators gradually <lb/>
            raised the sum total to thirteen hundred talents. It was <lb/>
            not so much that the money was required for the expenses <lb/>
            of a long and costly war, as that these men had accustomed <lb/>
            the people to largesses of money, dramatic representations, <lb/>
            and the erection of statues and temples. Themistokles was <lb/>
            the only man who had sneered at the great reputation <lb/>
            which Aristeides had won by his assessment of the Greek <lb/>
            states, saying, that the praise which was lavished on him <lb/>
            was not suitable to a man, but to a chest which kept <lb/>
            money safe. This he said as a retort to a saying of <lb/>
            Aristeides, who once, when Themistokles said that he <lb/>
            thought it the most valuable quality for a general to be <lb/>
            able to divine beforehand what the enemy would do, <lb/>
            answered, “ That, Themistokles, is very true, but it is also <lb/>
            the part of an honourable general to keep his hands clean."</p>
          <p>XXV. Aristeides, moreover, bound all the Greeks by <lb/>
            an oath to keep the league against the Persians, and him­ <lb/>
            self swore on behalf of Athens, throwing wedges of red <lb/>
            hot iron into the sea after the oath was taken, and pray­ <lb/>
            ing that the gods might so deal with those that broke <lb/>
            their faith. But afterwards, when circumstances forced <lb/>
            the Athenians to govern with a stronger hand, ho bade <lb/>
            the Athenians act as they pleased, for he would take upon <lb/>
            himself any guilt of perjury which they might incur. <lb/>
            And throughout his life Theophrastus observes that <lb/>
            Aristeides, though scrupulously just in his dealings with <lb/>
            his fellow-citizens, yet sometimes in dealing with other <lb/>
            states was guided rather by advantage than by equity. <lb/>
            For instance, when the Athenians were debating a proposal <lb/>
            of the Samians, that the treasure of the league should be <lb/>
            removed from Delos to Athens, a thing distinctly con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            trary to the articles of the alliance, Aristeides said that <lb/>
            it was not just, but that it was expedient to do so. He <lb/>
            himself, at the end of his life, after raising his city to <lb/>
            be the ruler of so many people, remained in his original <lb/>
            poverty, and took no less pride in his poverty than in <lb/>
            the victories which he had won. This is proved by the <lb/>
            following anecdote. Kallias, the torch-bearer in the <lb/>
            Eleusinian mysteries, a relation of his, was being prose­ <lb/>
            cuted on a capital charge by his private enemies. After <lb/>
            speaking with great moderation upon the subject of the <lb/>
            indictment, they used the following argument to the <lb/>
            jury: "Gentlemen, you all know Aristeides the son of <lb/>
            Lysimachus, whose name is renowned throughout Greece. <lb/>
            How think you that man fares at home, when you see <lb/>
            him appearing in public with such a worn-out cloak? <lb/>
            May we not suppose when we see him shivering out of <lb/>
            doors, that he has but little to eat at home, and is in want <lb/>
            of common necessaries? Yet Kallias, the richest man <lb/>
            in Athens, allows this man, who is his own cousin, to be <lb/>
            in want, he and his wife and children, though he has <lb/>
            often benefited by him and profited by his influence with <lb/>
            you." Kallias, perceiving that the jury were especially <lb/>
            wrought upon by this appeal and that it was likely to <lb/>
            tell against him, called Aristeides into the court, and <lb/>
            begged of him to bear witness to the jury that although <lb/>
            lie had often offered him money and begged him to accept <lb/>
            it he had always refused, answering that he prided him­ <lb/>
            self more upon his poverty than Kallias did upon his <lb/>
            wealth; for one may see many persons making both a <lb/>
            good and a bad use of riches, but it is hard to meet with <lb/>
            a man who bears poverty with honour. Those only <lb/>
            should be ashamed of poverty who are poor against their <lb/>
            wills. When Aristeides bore witness to the truth of this, <lb/>
            on behalf of Kallias, there was no one who heard him but <lb/>
            left the court wishing rather to be poor like Aristeides <lb/>
            than rich like Kallias. This story is preserved by <lb/>
            AEschines, the companion of Sokrates.</p>
          <p>Plato considers that this man alone, of all the great <lb/>
            men of Athens, is worthy of mention by him. Themis­ <lb/>
            tokles, and Kimon, and Perikles, did indeed fill the city <lb/>
            with public buildings, and money, and folly, but Aria­ <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            teides in his political acts cared for nothing but virtue <lb/>
            Une great proof of this is his kindly treatment of Themis­ <lb/>
            tokles. Though this man was his enemy throughout, <lb/>
            and was the cause of his banishment by ostracism, yet <lb/>
            when Themistokles gave him an opportunity of reveng­ <lb/>
            ing himself in a similar manner he never remembered <lb/>
            the injuries which he had received at his hands, but <lb/>
            while Kimon, and Alkmæon, and many others, were en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to drive him into exile and bringing all kinds <lb/>
            of accusations against him,Aristeides alone never did or said <lb/>
            anything against him, and did not rejoice over the spectacle <lb/>
            of his enemy's ruin, just as he never envied his previous <lb/>
            prosperity.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Some writers say that Aristeides died in Pontus, <lb/>
            to which country he had been sent on matters of state: <lb/>
            while others say that he died of old age at Athens, <lb/>
            respected and honoured by all his countrymen there. <lb/>
            Kraterus of Macedonia tells us the following particulars <lb/>
            about his end. After Themistokles went into exile the <lb/>
            common people grew insolent and produced a numerous <lb/>
            brood of informers, who constantly assailed the noblest <lb/>
            and most powerful citizens through envy of their pros­ <lb/>
            perity and influence. One of these men, Diophantus of <lb/>
            Amphitrope by name, obtained a verdict against Aris­ <lb/>
            teides on a charge of receiving bribes. It was stated <lb/>
            that when he was regulating the assessment of the Ionians <lb/>
            he received money from them to tax them more lightly. <lb/>
            As he was unable to pay the fine of fifty mines, which <lb/>
            the court laid upon him, he left Athens and died some­ <lb/>
            where in Ionia. But Kraterus offers no documentary <lb/>
            evidence of this, neither of the sentence of his condem­ <lb/>
            nation nor the decree of the people, although in general <lb/>
            it is his habit to quote his authority for statements of this <lb/>
            kind. And almost all others who have spoken of the <lb/>
            harsh treatment of generals by the people mention the <lb/>
            banishment of Themistokles, the imprisonment of Mil­ <lb/>
            tiades, the fine imposed on Perikles, and the suicide of <lb/>
            Paches in court when sentence was pronounced against him, <lb/>
            but although they speak of the banishment of Aristeides, <lb/>
            they never allude to this trial and sentence upon him.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Moreover, there is his tomb at Phalerum, <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            which is said to have been constructed at the public <lb/>
            expense, because he did not leave enough money to <lb/>
            defray his funeral expenses. It is also related that his <lb/>
            daughters were publicly married at the charges of the <lb/>
            state, which provided them each with a dowry of three <lb/>
            thousand drachmas. At the instance of Alkibiades, his <lb/>
            son Lysimachus was also presented with a hundred silver <lb/>
            minæ, and as many acres of planted land, and in addition <lb/>
            to this, an allowance of four drachmas a day. Kallisthenes <lb/>
            also tells us that this Lysimachus leaving a daughter <lb/>
            named Polykrite, she was assigned by the Athenians <lb/>
            the same daily allowance of food as is bestowed upon <lb/>
            the victors in the Olympian games. But Demetrius <lb/>
            of Phalerum, Hieronymus of Rhodes, Aristoxenus the <lb/>
            musician, and Aristotle, (if we are to believe the <lb/>
            ‘ Treatise on Nobility ’ to be a genuine work of his) say, <lb/>
            that Myrto, the granddaughter of Aristeides, lived in the <lb/>
            house of Sokrates the philosopher, who was indeed <lb/>
            married to another woman, but who took her into his <lb/>
            house because she was a widow and destitute of the <lb/>
            necessaries of life. These authors are sufficiently confuted <lb/>
            by Panætius in his writings on Sokrates. Demetrius <lb/>
            of Phalerum says, in his book about Sokrates, that he knew <lb/>
            one Lysimachus, a very poor man, who dwelt near the <lb/>
            Temple of Iacchus and made his living by the interpre­ <lb/>
            tation of dreams. Demetrius further states that he <lb/>
            carried a bill before the Assembly by which this man's <lb/>
            mother and sister were provided with a pension of three <lb/>
            obols daily at the public expense. Demetrius, however, <lb/>
            when himself a legislator, appointed that each of these <lb/>
            women should receive a drachma instead of three obols <lb/>
            a day. And we need not wonder at the people taking <lb/>
            such care of the resident citizens, when we read that, <lb/>
            hearing that the granddaughter of Aristogeiton was living <lb/>
            in poverty at Lemnos, so poor that no one would marry <lb/>
            her, they brought her back to Athens, gave her in marriage <lb/>
            to a man of high birth, and bestowed upon her a farm <lb/>
            at Potamus for a marriage portion. The city of Athens <lb/>
            has shown many instances of this kindness and goodness <lb/>
            of heart even down to our times, and is justly praised <lb/>
            and admired for it <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <pb n="98"/>

          </ab>
          <p>1. MARCUS CATO is said to have been born at Tusculum, but <lb/>
            to have been brought up and spent his time upon a farm <lb/>
            belonging to his father in the Sabine territory, before he <lb/>
            began to take part in war or politics. We know nothing <lb/>
            of his ancestry, except that he himself tells us that his <lb/>
            father, Marcus, was a good man and brave soldier, and that <lb/>
            his grandfather, Cato, received several military rewards <lb/>
            for his services, and that having had five horses killed under <lb/>
            him, he received the value of them from the public treasury, <lb/>
            as an acknowledgment of his gallantry.</p>
          <p>It was the Roman custom to call those who had no <lb/>
            ancestry to recommend them, but who rose by their own <lb/>
            merits, new men. This name was applied to Cato, who <lb/>
            said that he was indeed new to honours and posts of <lb/>
            importance, but that, in respect of his brave and virtuous <lb/>
            ancestry, he was a man of ancient family. His third <lb/>
            name originally was not Cato, but Priscus, and was <lb/>
            changed to Cato on account of his wisdom, for in Latin <lb/>
            catus means " clever." In appearance he was rather red- <lb/>
            haired, and grey-eyed, peculiarities which are ill-naturedly <lb/>
            dwelt upon by the writer of the epigram­ <lb/>
            “ Red-haired, grey-eyed, and savage-tusked as well, <lb/>
            Porcius will find no welcome e'en in hell."</p>
          <p>Accustomed as he was to hard exercise, temperate living, <lb/>
            and frequent campaigns, his body was always both <lb/>
            healthy and strong; while he also practised the power of <lb/>
            speech, thinking it a necessary instrument for a man who <lb/>
            does not intend to live an obscure and inactive life. He <lb/>
            consequently improved his talents in this respect by <lb/>
            pleading causes in the neighbouring villages and towns, <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            so that he was soon admitted to be a capable speaker, and <lb/>
            afterwards to be a good orator. From this time all who <lb/>
            conversed with him perceived a gravity and wisdom in <lb/>
            his mind which qualified him to undertake the most <lb/>
            important duties of a statesman. Not only was he so dis­ <lb/>
            interested as to plead without receiving money from his <lb/>
            clients, but he also did not think the glory which ho <lb/>
            gained in these contests to be that after which a man <lb/>
            ought to strive, in comparison with that which is gained <lb/>
            in battle and campaigns, in which he was so eager to <lb/>
            distinguish himself that when quite a lad his body was <lb/>
            covered with wounds, all in front. He himself tells us <lb/>
            that he made his first campaign at the age of seventeen, <lb/>
            when Hannibal was ranging through Italy uncontrolled. <lb/>
            In battle he was prompt, stedfast, and undismayed, and <lb/>
            was wont to address the enemy with threats and rough <lb/>
            language, and to encourage the others to do so, as he <lb/>
            rightly pointed out that this often cows the enemy's spirit <lb/>
            as effectually as blows. When on the march he used to <lb/>
            carry his own arms, and be followed by one servant who <lb/>
            carried his provisions. It is said that he never spoke harshly <lb/>
            to this man, no matter what food he placed before him, but <lb/>
            that he would often help him to do his work when he was <lb/>
            at leisure from military duty. He drank only water when <lb/>
            campaigning, except that when suffering from parching <lb/>
            thirst he would ask for some vinegar, and sometimes when <lb/>
            his strength fairly failed he would drink a little wine.</p>
          <p>II. Near his estate was a cottage which had once <lb/>
            belonged to Manius Curius, who three times received the <lb/>
            honour of a triumph. Cato used frequently to walk over <lb/>
            and look at this cottage, and, as he observed the smallness <lb/>
            of the plot of ground attached to it, and the simplicity of <lb/>
            the dwelling itself, he would reflect upon how Curius, <lb/>
            after having made himself the first man in Rome, after <lb/>
            conquering the most warlike nations, and driving King <lb/>
            Pyrrhus out of Italy, used to dig this little plot of ground <lb/>
            with his own hands, and dwelt in this little cottage, after <lb/>
            having thrice triumphed. It was there that the ambassa­ <lb/>
            dors of the Samnites found him sitting by the hearth, <lb/>
            cooking turnips, and offered him much gold ; but he sent <lb/>
            them away, saying, “ that a man who was contented with <note type="footnote"> 11 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            such a supper, had no need of gold, and that it was more <lb/>
            honourable for him to conquer those who possessed gold, <lb/>
            than to possess it himself." Cato, after leaving the <lb/>
            cottage, full of these memories, returned to his own house <lb/>
            and farm, and after viewing its extent and the number of <lb/>
            slaves upon it, he increased the amount of his own daily <lb/>
            labour, and retrenched his superfluous expenses.</p>
          <p>When Fabius Maximus took the city of Tarentum, Cato, <lb/>
            who was a very young lad at the time, was serving in his <lb/>
            army. He became intimate there with one Nearchus, a <lb/>
            philosopher of the Pythagorean school, and listened with <lb/>
            much interest to his discourses. Hearing this man, like <lb/>
            Plato, describe pleasure as the greatest temptation to evil, <lb/>
            and the body as the chief hindrance to the soul, which <lb/>
            can only free and purify itself by such a course of reason­ <lb/>
            ing as removes it from and sets it above all bodily <lb/>
            passions and feelings, he was yet more encouraged in his <lb/>
            love of simplicity and frugality. In other respects he is <lb/>
            said to have studied Hellenic literature late in life, and <lb/>
            not to have read Greek books till extreme old age, when <lb/>
            he greatly improved his style of oratory, partly by the <lb/>
            study of Thucydides, but chiefly by that of Demosthenes. <lb/>
            Be this as it may, his writings are full of Greek ideas and <lb/>
            Greek anecdotes: and many of his apophthegms and <lb/>
            maxims are literally translated from the Greek.</p>
          <p>III. The estate adjoining that of Cato belonged to one <lb/>
            of the most powerful and highly born patricians of Rome, <lb/>
            Valerius Flaccus, a man who had a keen eye for rising <lb/>
            merit, and generously fostered it until it received public <lb/>
            recognition. This man heard accounts of Cato's life from <lb/>
            his servants, how he would proceed to the court early in <lb/>
            the morning, and plead the causes of all who required his <lb/>
            services, and then on returning to his farm would work <lb/>
            with his servants, in winter wearing a coarse coat without <lb/>
            sleeves, in summer nothing but his tunic, and how he used <lb/>
            to sit at meals with his servants, eating the same loaf and <lb/>
            drinking the same wine. Many other stories of his good­ <lb/>
            ness and simplicity and sententious remarks were related <lb/>
            to Valerius, who became interested in his neighbour, <lb/>
            and invited him to dinner. They became intimate, and <lb/>
            Valerius, observing his quiet and ingenuous disposition, <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            like a plant that requires careful treatment and an exten­ <lb/>
            sive space in which to develop itself, encouraged and <lb/>
            urged him to take part in the political life of Rome. On <lb/>
            going to Rome he at once gained admirers and friends by <lb/>
            his able pleadings in the law courts, while he obtained <lb/>
            considerable preferment by the interest of Valerius, being <lb/>
            appointed first military tribune, and then quæstor. After <lb/>
            this he became so distinguished a man as to be able to <lb/>
            compete with Valerius himself for the highest offices in <lb/>
            the state, and they were elected together, first as consuls, <lb/>
            and afterwards as censors. Of the older Romans, Cato <lb/>
            attached himself particularly to Fabius Maximus, a man <lb/>
            of the greatest renown and power, although it was his dis­ <lb/>
            position and mode of life which Cato especially desired to <lb/>
            imitate. Wherefore he did not hesitate to oppose Scipio <lb/>
            the Great, who was then a young man, but a rival and <lb/>
            opponent of Fabius. Cato was appointed to act as his <lb/>
            quæstor in the war in Africa, and on perceiving that <lb/>
            Scipio was living with his usual lavish expenditure, and <lb/>
            supplying his soldiery with extravagant pay, he sharply <lb/>
            rebuked him, saying, " that it was not the waste of the <lb/>
            public money that vexed him so much as the ruin of the <lb/>
            old frugal habits of the soldiers, who were led to indulge <lb/>
            in pleasure and luxury by receiving more pay than was <lb/>
            necessary to supply their daily wants." When Scipio <lb/>
            answered that he did not require an economist for his <lb/>
            quæstor, at a time when he was preparing to wage war <lb/>
            on a grand scale, and reminded him that he would have to <lb/>
            give an account to the Roman people of battles won, not <lb/>
            of money expended, Cato left the army of Scipio, which was <lb/>
            then being assembled in Sicily. He proceeded at once to <lb/>
            Rome, and by adding his voice to that of Fabius in the <lb/>
            Senate, in blame of Scipio's unspeakable waste of money, <lb/>
            and his childish and unsoldierly love of the public games. <lb/>
            and the theatre, conduct more worthy of the president of <lb/>
            a public festival than of the commander-in-chief of an <lb/>
            army, prevailed upon the people to send tribunes to <lb/>
            enquire into the charges against him, and if they proved <lb/>
            true, to bring him back to Rome. When they arrived in <lb/>
            Sicily, however, Scipio pointed out to them that the pre­ <note type="footnote"> * Cf. Livy, xx x. ch. 19, sqq. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            parations which he had made would ensure him the <lb/>
            victory, and that although he loved pleasant society In his <lb/>
            hours of leisure, yet that he had never allowed his plea­ <lb/>
            sures to interfere with his serious duties. The tribunes <lb/>
            were perfectly satisfied with this explanation, and Scipio <lb/>
            sailed for Africa.</p>
          <p>IV. Cato, however, gained considerable credit by his <lb/>
            speeches on this occasion, and the Romans generally <lb/>
            called him the new Demosthenes; yet his manner of <lb/>
            life was more admired than his eloquence. Cleverness <lb/>
            of speech was a quality which nearly all the young <lb/>
            men of the time sought to attain, but Cato was singular <lb/>
            in his keeping up the severe traditions of his ancestors in <lb/>
            labouring with his own hands, eating a simple dinner, <lb/>
            lighting no fire to cook his breakfast, wearing a plain <lb/>
            dress, living in a mean house, and neither coveting super­ <lb/>
            fluities nor courting their possessors. The Romans were <lb/>
            at this period extending their empire so much as to lose <lb/>
            much of their own original simplicity of living, as each <lb/>
            new conquest brought them into contact with foreign <lb/>
            customs and new modes of life. They therefore naturally <lb/>
            looked with admiration upon Cato, observing that while <lb/>
            they became enervated by pleasures and broke down <lb/>
            under labours, he on the other hand seemed unaffected <lb/>
            by either, and that too, not only while he was young and <lb/>
            eager for fame: but even when he was an old grey-headed <lb/>
            man, after he had been consul and had triumphed, ho yet, <lb/>
            like a victorious athlete, still kept himself in training, and <lb/>
            never relaxed his severe discipline. He himself tells us <lb/>
            that he never wore a garment worth more than a hundred <lb/>
            drachmas, that when he was general and consul he still <lb/>
            drank the same wine as his servants, that his dinner <lb/>
            never cost him more than thirty ases in the market, and <lb/>
            that he only indulged himself to this extent for the good <lb/>
            of the state, that he might be strong and able to serve <lb/>
            his country in the field. When he was left a piece <lb/>
            of Babylonian tapestry he at once disposed of it; none <lb/>
            of his rooms were whitewashed, and he never bought a <lb/>
            slave for more than fifteen hundred drachmas, seeing that <lb/>
            he required, not effeminate and handsome servants, but <lb/>
            hardworking and strong men, to tend his horses and <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            lord his cattle : and these, too, when they grew old and <lb/>
            past work he thought it best to sell, and not feed them <lb/>
            at his expense when they were useless. His rule was that <lb/>
            nothing is cheap which one does not want, but that <lb/>
            superfluities are dearly purchased even if they cost but <lb/>
            one penny: and that it is better to buy land which can be <lb/>
            ploughed, or where cattle can graze, than beds of flowers <lb/>
            which require watering, and paths which have to be swept <lb/>
            and kept in order.</p>
          <p>V. These habits some ascribed to narrowness of mind, <lb/>
            while others thought that he carried parsimony and avarice <lb/>
            to excess in himself in order by his example to reform and <lb/>
            restrain others. Be this as it may, I for my own part <lb/>
            consider that his conduct in treating his slaves like beasts <lb/>
            of burden, and selling them when old and worn out, is the <lb/>
            mark of an excessively harsh disposition, which disregards <lb/>
            the claims of our common human nature, and merely <lb/>
            considers the question of profit andloss. Kindness, in­ <lb/>
            deed, is OF wider application than mere justice; for we <lb/>
            naturally treat men alone according to justice and the <lb/>
            laws, while kindness and gratitude, as though from a <lb/>
            plenteous spring, often extend even to irrational animals. <lb/>
            It is right for a good man to feed horses which have <lb/>
            been worn out in his service, and not merely to train <lb/>
            dogs when they are young, but to take care of them <lb/>
            when they are old. When the Athenian people built the <lb/>
            Parthenon, they set free the mules which had done the <lb/>
            hardest work in drawing the stones up to the acropolis, <lb/>
            and let them graze where they pleased unmolested. It <lb/>
            is said that one of them came of its own accord to where <lb/>
            the works were going on, and used to walk up to the <lb/>
            acropolis with the beasts who were drawing up their <lb/>
            loads, as if to encourage them and show them the way. <lb/>
            This mule was, by a decree of the people of Athens, <lb/>
            maintained at the public expense for the rest of its life. <lb/>
            The racehorses of Kimon also, who won an Olympic <lb/>
            victory, are buried close to the monument of their <lb/>
            master. Many persons, too, have made friends and com­ <lb/>
            panions of dogs, as did Xanthippus in old times, whose <lb/>
            dog swam all the way to Salamis beside his master's <lb/>
            ship when the Athenians left their city, and which he <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            buried on the promontory which to this day is called the <lb/>
            Dog's Tomb.* We ought not to treat living things as we <lb/>
            do our clothes and our shoes, and throw them away <lb/>
            after we have worn them out; but we ought to accustom <lb/>
            ourselves to show kindness in these cases, if only in order <lb/>
            to teach ourselves our duty towards one another. For <lb/>
            my own part I would not even sell an ox that had <lb/>
            laboured for me because he was old, much less would I <lb/>
            turn an old man out of his accustomed haunts and mode <lb/>
            of life, which is as great an affliction to him as sending <lb/>
            him into a foreign land, merely that I might gain a few <lb/>
            miserable coins by selling one who must be as useless to <lb/>
            his buyer as he was to his seller.</p>
          <p>Cato, however, as if taking a perverse pleasure in <lb/>
            flaunting his meannesses, relates that he left behind him <lb/>
            in Spain the horse which he rode when consul there, in <lb/>
            order to save the state the cost of carrying him over to <lb/>
            Italy. Whether these acts of his are to be ascribed to <lb/>
            magnanimity or narrow-mindedness the reader must decide <lb/>
            for himself.</p>
          <p>VI. He was a man of wonderful temperance, in all <lb/>
            other respects also. For example, when he was general, <lb/>
            he only drew from the public stock three Attic bushels <lb/>
            of wheat a month for himself and his servants, and less <lb/>
            than three half-bushels of barley a day for his horses. <lb/>
            When he was Governor of Sardinia, where former <lb/>
            governors had been in the habit of charging their tents, <lb/>
            bedding, and wearing-apparel to the province, and like­ <lb/>
            wise making it pay large sums for their entertainment <lb/>
            and that of their friends, he introduced an unheard-of <lb/>
            system of economy. He charged nothing to the province, <lb/>
            and visited the various cities without a carriage, walking <lb/>
            on foot alone, attended by one single public servant carry­ <lb/>
            ing his robe of state and the vessel to make libations at <lb/>
            a sacrifice. With all this he showed himself so affable <lb/>
            and simple to those under his rule, so severe and inex­ <lb/>
            orable in the administration of justice, and so vigilant <lb/>
            and careful in seeing that his orders were duly executed, <lb/>
            that the government of Rome never was more feared or <lb/>
            more loved in Sardinia than when he governed that island. <note type="footnote"> * See vol. i., ‘ Life of Themistokles,' ch. x. </note> <pb n="105"/>
            </p>
          <p>VII. His conversation seems also to have had this <lb/>
            character, for he was cheerful and harsh all at once, <lb/>
            pleasant and yet severe as a companion, fond of jokes, <lb/>
            but morose at the same time, just as Plato tells us that <lb/>
            Sokrates, if judged merely from his outside, appeared to <lb/>
            be only a silly man with a face like a satyr, who was rude <lb/>
            to all he met, though his inner nature was earnest and full <lb/>
            of thoughts that moved his hearers to tears and touched <lb/>
            their hearts. For this reason I cannot understand how <lb/>
            any persons can see a likeness between the orations of <lb/>
            Lysias and those of Cato; however, this point must be <lb/>
            decided by those who are more skilled than myself in <lb/>
            the comparison of oratorical styles. I shall now relate a <lb/>
            few of his more remarkable sayings, believing that a <lb/>
            man's real character can be better judged of by his <lb/>
            words than by his looks, although some people hold the <lb/>
            contrary opinion.</p>
          <p>VIII. Once when he wished to restrain the Romans <lb/>
            from distributing a large quantity of corn as a largesse <lb/>
            to the people, he began his speech: "It is difficult, my <lb/>
            fellow-citizens, to make the stomach hear reason, because <lb/>
            it has no ears." When desiring to blame the extrava­ <lb/>
            gance of the Romans, he said that a city could not be <lb/>
            safe in which a fish sold dearer than an ox. He said, too, <lb/>
            that the Romans were like sheep, who never form opinions <lb/>
            of their own, but follow where the others lead them. “ Just <lb/>
            so," said he, “ when you are assembled together you are <lb/>
            led by men whose advice you would scorn to take about <lb/>
            your own private affairs." With regard to female influence <lb/>
            he once said, “ All mankind rule their wives, we rule all <lb/>
            mankind, and we are ruled by our wives." This remark, <lb/>
            however, is borrowed from Themistokles. He one day, <lb/>
            when his child was instigating its mother to lay many <lb/>
            commands upon him, said, “ Wife, remember that the <lb/>
            Athenians rule the Greeks, I rule the Athenians, you rule <lb/>
            me, and your child rules you; wherefore let him not abuse <lb/>
            his power, which, though he knows it not, is greater than <lb/>
            that of anyone else in Greece." Cato also said that the <lb/>
            Romans fixed the price, not only of different dyes, but of <lb/>
            different professions. “ Just as the dyers," said he, " dye <lb/>
            stuff of whatever colour they see people pleased with, so <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            do our young men only study and apply themselves to <lb/>
            those subjects which are praised and commended by you." <lb/>
            He used also to beg of them, if they had become great by <lb/>
            virtue and self-restraint, not to degenerate; and if, on the <lb/>
            other hand, their empire had been won by licentiousness <lb/>
            and vice, to reform themselves, since by the latter means <lb/>
            they had become so great as not to need any further <lb/>
            assistance from them. Those who were always seeking <lb/>
            office, he said, were like men who could not find their way, <lb/>
            who always wished to walk with lictors * before them to <lb/>
            show them the road. He blamed his countrymen for <lb/>
            often electing the same men to public offices. “ You will <lb/>
            appear," said he, " either to think that the office is not <lb/>
            worth much, or else that there are not many worthy to <lb/>
            fill it." Alluding to one of his enemies who led a dis­ <lb/>
            solute and discreditable life, he said : " That man's mother <lb/>
            takes it as a curse rather than a blessing if any one hopes <lb/>
            that her son will survive her." When a certain man sold <lb/>
            his ancestral estate, which was situated by the seashore, <lb/>
            Cato pretended to admire him, as being more powerful <lb/>
            than the sea itself, “ for this man," said he, has “ drunk up <lb/>
            the fields which the sea itself could not swallow." When <lb/>
            King Eumenes came to Rome the Senate received him <lb/>
            with special honours, and he was much courted and run <lb/>
            after. Cato, however, held himself aloof and would not <lb/>
            go near him, and when some one said Yet he is an <lb/>
            excellent man, and a good friend to Home," he answered, <lb/>
            “ It may be so, but a king is by nature an animal that <lb/>
            lives on human flesh." None of those who had borne the <lb/>
            title of king, according to Cato, were to be compared with <lb/>
            Epameinondas, or Perikles, or Themistokles, or with <lb/>
            Manius Curius or Hamilcar Barcas. He used to say that <lb/>
            his enemies hated him because he began his day's work <lb/>
            while it was still dark, and because he neglected his own <lb/>
            affairs to attend to those of the public. He also was wont <lb/>
            to say that he had rather his good actions should go un­ <lb/>
            rewarded than that his bad ones should be unpunished; <lb/>
            and that he pardoned all who did wrong except himself.</p>
          <p>IX. When the Romans sent three ambassadors to <note type="footnote"> * Lictors were attendants granted to Roman magistrates as a mark <lb/>
            of official dignity, Sec vol. i., ‘ Life of Romulus,’ ch. xxvi. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            Dithynia, one of whom was crippled by the gout, another <lb/>
            had been trepanned and had a piece taken out of his head, <lb/>
            and the third was thought to be a simpleton, Cato re­ <lb/>
            marked that the Romans had sent an embassy which had <lb/>
            neither feet, head, nor heart. When, for the sake of <lb/>
            Polybius the historian, Scipio entreated Cato to exert his <lb/>
            influence on behalf of the Achæan exiles, after a long <lb/>
            debate in the Senate, where some advised that they should <lb/>
            be sent back to their own country, and some that they <lb/>
            should still be detained at Rome, he got up and said, <lb/>
            “ Have we nothing better to do than to sit all day discuss­ <lb/>
            ing whether a parcel of old Greeks shall be buried here or <lb/>
            in Achaia?" A few days after the Senate had decreed <lb/>
            the restoration of the exiles, Polybius proposed to make <lb/>
            another application, that they should be restored to all <lb/>
            the offices which they formerly held in Achaia. He <lb/>
            asked Cato whether he thought that he should succeed <lb/>
            in this second appeal to the Senate; to which Cato <lb/>
            answered with a smile, that he was imitating Ulysses, <lb/>
            when he returned again into the cave of the Cyclops to <lb/>
            fetch the hat and girdle which he had left behind and <lb/>
            forgotten. He said that wise men gained more advantage <lb/>
            from fools, than fools from wise men; for the wise men <lb/>
            avoid the errors of fools, but fools cannot imitate the <lb/>
            example of wise men. He said that he loved young men <lb/>
            to have red cheeks rather than pale ones, and that he did <lb/>
            not care for a soldier who used his hands while he marched <lb/>
            and his feet while he fought, or one who snored louder in <lb/>
            bed than he shouted in battle. When reproaching a very <lb/>
            fat man he said, " How can this man's body be useful to <lb/>
            his country, when all parts between the neck and the <lb/>
            groin are possessed by the belly ?" Once when an epicure <lb/>
            wished to become his friend, he said that he could not live <lb/>
            with a man whose palate was more sensitive than his <lb/>
            heart. He said also that the soul of a lover inhabits the <lb/>
            body of his beloved. He himself tells us, that in his <lb/>
            whole life he repented of three things only :— First, that <lb/>
            he had trusted a woman with a secret. Secondly, that <lb/>
            he had gone by water when he might have gone by land. <lb/>
            Thirdly, that he had passed one day without having made <lb/>
            his will. To an old man who was acting wrongly he said, <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            " My good sir, old age is ugly enough without your adding <lb/>
            the deformity of wickedness to it." When a certain tribune, <lb/>
            who was suspected of being a poisoner, was endeavouring <lb/>
            to carry a bad law, Cato remarked, " Young man, I do not <lb/>
            know which is the worst for us, to drink what you mix, <lb/>
            or to enact what you propose." Once when he was <lb/>
            abused by a man of vicious life, he answered, “ We are <lb/>
            not contending upon equal terms ; you are accustomed to <lb/>
            hearing and using bad language, while I am both unused <lb/>
            to hearing it and unwilling to use it."</p>
          <p>X. When he was elected consul, together with his friend <lb/>
            and neighbour Valerius Flaccus, the province which fell <lb/>
            to his lot was that which the Romans call Hither Spain.- <lb/>
            While he was there engaged in establishing order, partly <lb/>
            by persuasion, and partly by force, he was attacked by a <lb/>
            large army of the natives, and was in danger of being <lb/>
            disgracefully defeated by their overwhelming numbers. <lb/>
            Consequently he applied for aid to the neighbouring tribe <lb/>
            of the Celtiberians, who demanded as the price of their <lb/>
            assistance the sum of two hundred talents. At this <lb/>
            every one protested that it was unworthy of Romans to <lb/>
            pay barbarians for their alliance, but Cato said that he <lb/>
            saw no evil in the practice, since, if the Romans were <lb/>
            victorious, they would pay them from the spoils of the <lb/>
            enemy, while if they were defeated there would be no one <lb/>
            to demand the money and no one to pay it. He won a <lb/>
            pitched battle on this occasion, and was very successful in <lb/>
            his whole campaign. Polybius indeed tells us that in one <lb/>
            day at his command all the cities on this side of the <lb/>
            river Guadalquiver pulled down their walls : and yet they <lb/>
            were very numerous, and filled with a warlike population. <lb/>
            Cato himself tells us that he took more cities than he spent <lb/>
            days in Spain ; nor is this a vain boast, if the number <lb/>
            captured really, as is stated, amounted to four hundred. <lb/>
            His soldiers enriched themselves considerably during the <lb/>
            campaign; and at the termination of it he distributed a <lb/>
            pound of silver to each man, saying that it was better <lb/>
            that many Romans should return to Rome with silver in <lb/>
            their pockets than that a few should return with gold. <note type="footnote"> * Spain was divided by the Romans into two provinces, of which <lb/>
            this one was that which was nearer to Rome </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            He himself states that he received no part of the plunder <lb/>
            except what he ate or drank. " I do not," said he, “ blame <lb/>
            those who endeavour to enrich themselves by such means, <lb/>
            but I had rather vie with the noblest in virtue than with <lb/>
            the richest in wealth, or with the most covetous in cove­ <lb/>
            tonsness." He not only kept his own hands clean, but those <lb/>
            of his followers also. He took five servants to the war <lb/>
            with him. One of these, Paccius by name, bought three <lb/>
            boys at a sale of captives; but when Cato heard of it, <lb/>
            Paccius, rather than come into his presence, banged him­ <lb/>
            self. Cato sold the boys, and paid the price into the <lb/>
            public treasury.</p>
          <p>XI. While he was still in Spain, Scipio the Great, who <lb/>
            was his personal enemy, desiring to check his career of <lb/>
            success, and to obtain the management of Spanish affairs <lb/>
            for himself, contrived to get himself appointed to succeed <lb/>
            Cato in his government. He at once hurried to Spain and <lb/>
            brought Cato's rule to an end. Cato, however, at once <lb/>
            marched to meet Scipio with an escort of five companies <lb/>
            of infantry and five hundred horsemen. On his way he <lb/>
            conquered the tribe of the Lacetani; and finding among <lb/>
            them six hundred deserters from the Roman army, he put <lb/>
            them to death. When Scipio expressed his dissatisfaction <lb/>
            with this, Cato sarcastically answered, that Rome would <lb/>
            be greatest if those of high birth and station, and those <lb/>
            of plebeian origin like himself, would only contend with <lb/>
            one another in virtue. However, as the Senate decreed <lb/>
            that nothing that Cato had settled in the province should <lb/>
            be altered or rearranged, Scipio found that it was he <lb/>
            rather than Cato that was disgraced, as he had to pass his <lb/>
            time in inglorious idleness, while Cato, after enjoying a <lb/>
            triumph, did not retire into a life of luxury and leisure, <lb/>
            as is done by so many men whose object is display rather <lb/>
            than true virtue, after they'have risen to the highest <lb/>
            honours in the state by being elected consuls and enjoying <lb/>
            the honour of a triumph. He did not impair the glorious <lb/>
            example which he had given, by withdrawing his attention <lb/>
            from the affairs of his country, but offered his services to <lb/>
            his friends and fellow-countrymen, both in the courts of <lb/>
            law and in the field, as willingly as those who have just <lb/>
            begun their public career, and are keenly eager to be <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            elected to some new office in which they may win Cresc <lb/>
            distinction.</p>
          <p>XII. He went with the consul Tiberius Sempronius as <lb/>
            legate, and assisted him in regulating the country about <lb/>
            the Danube and Thrace; and he also served as military <lb/>
            tribune under Manius Acilius during his campaign in <lb/>
            Greece against Antiochus the Great, who caused more <lb/>
            terror to the Romans than any one man since the time of <lb/>
            Hannibal. Antiochus had originally inherited nearly the <lb/>
            whole of Asia, that is, as much as Seleukus Nikator had <lb/>
            possessed, and having added many warlike tribes to his <lb/>
            empire, was so elated by his conquests as to attack the <lb/>
            Romans, whom he regarded as the only nation remaining <lb/>
            in the whole world which was worthy to be his antago­ <lb/>
            nist. He put forward as a plausible reason for beginning <lb/>
            the war that he intended to liberate the Greeks, who did <lb/>
            not require his interference, as they had just been made <lb/>
            free and independent by the Romans, who had delivered <lb/>
            them from the tyranny of Philip and the Macedonians. <lb/>
            Antiochus crossed over into Greece, which at once became <lb/>
            unsettled, and a prey to hopes and fears suggested by her <lb/>
            political leaders. Manius at once sent ambassadors to the <lb/>
            various cities. Titus Flamininus, as has been related in <lb/>
            his Life, restrained the greater part of them from revolu­ <lb/>
            tionary proceedings, and kept them to their allegiance, <lb/>
            but Cato won over Corinth, Patræ, and Ægium. Most of <lb/>
            his time was spent in Athens; and there is said to be still <lb/>
            extant a speech which he made to the people there in <lb/>
            Greek, in which he speaks with admiration of the virtue <lb/>
            of the Athenians of old, and dwells upon his own pleasure <lb/>
            in viewing so great and beautiful a city. This, however, <lb/>
            is a fabrication, for we know that he conversed with the <lb/>
            Athenians through an interpreter, though he was able to <lb/>
            spaak their language, because he wished to keep to the <lb/>
            ways of his fathers, and administer a rebuke to those who <lb/>
            extravagantly admired the Greeks. Thus he laughed at <lb/>
            Postumius Albinus, who wrote a history in Greek and <lb/>
            begged that his mistakes might be pardoned, saying that <lb/>
            it would be right to pardon them if he wrote his history <lb/>
            by a decree of the council of Amphiktyons. He himself <lb/>
            says that the Athenians were surprised at the shortness <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            and pregnant nature of his talk; for what he said in a <lb/>
            few words, his interpreter translated by a great many: <lb/>
            and in general he concludes that the Greeks talk from the <lb/>
            lips, and the Romans from the heart.</p>
          <p>XIII. When Antiochus occupied the pass of Thermo­ <lb/>
            pylae with his army, and, after adding to the natural <lb/>
            strength of the place by artificial defences, established him­ <lb/>
            self there as if in an impregnable position, the Romans <lb/>
            decided that to attack him in front was altogether im­ <lb/>
            possible, but Cato, remembering how the Persians under <lb/>
            Xerxes had turned the Greek forces by a circuitous march <lb/>
            over the mountains, took a part of the force and set off <lb/>
            by night. When they had gone for some distance over the <lb/>
            mountains, the prisoner who served as their guide lost his <lb/>
            way, and wandered about in that precipitous and pathless <lb/>
            wilderness so as to cause great discouragement to the <lb/>
            soldiers. Seeing this, Cato ordered every one to halt and <lb/>
            await his orders, and himself, with one companion, one <lb/>
            Lucius Manlius, an experienced mountaineer, laboriously <lb/>
            and daringly plunged along through intense darkness, for <lb/>
            there was no moon, while the trees and rocks added to <lb/>
            their difficulties by preventing their seeing distinctly <lb/>
            whither they were going, until they came to a path, <lb/>
            which, as they thought, led directly down upon the camp <lb/>
            of the enemy. Hereupon they set up marks to guide <lb/>
            them upon some conspicuous crags of Mount Kallidromus, <lb/>
            and returning to the army, led it to these marks, and <lb/>
            started along the paths which they had descried. But <lb/>
            before they had proceeded far the path ended in a preci­ <lb/>
            pice, at which they were both surprised and disheartened; <lb/>
            for they could not tell, either by sight or hearing, that <lb/>
            they were close to the enemy. It was now about day­ <lb/>
            break, and they thought that they heard voices near at <lb/>
            hand, and soon were able to see a Greek camp and an <lb/>
            outpost at the foot of the precipice. Cato hereupon halted <lb/>
            his army, and ordered the Firmiani,* in whom he reposed <lb/>
            especial confidence, to come forward alone. When they <lb/>
            had assembled round him, he said, " I wish to take one of <lb/>
            the enemy prisoner, and learn from him of what troops <lb/>
            this outpost is formed, what their numbers are, how the <note type="footnote"> * The inhabitants of the town of Firmum, in Picenum ; now Fermo</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            rest of the army are placed, and what preparations they <lb/>
            have made to resist us. You must dash upon them as <lb/>
            quickly and boldly as lions do upon their defenceless <lb/>
            prey." At these words of Cato's the Firmiani at once <lb/>
            rushed down and attacked the outpost. The suddenness of <lb/>
            theis onset threw the enemy into complete confusion, and <lb/>
            they soon caught one of them and brought him before <lb/>
            Cato. Learning from this man that all the rest of the <lb/>
            army was with King Antiochus himself, guarding the pass <lb/>
            of Thermopylae, and that only a body of six hundred <lb/>
            picked Ætolians were watching the path over the moun­ <lb/>
            tains, Cato despising so small and contemptible a force, <lb/>
            at once drew his sword, and led on his troops with shouts <lb/>
            and trumpets sounding the charge. The Ætolians, as <lb/>
            soon as they saw the Romans descending from the hills, <lb/>
            fled to the main body, and filled it with confusion and <lb/>
            terror.</p>
          <p>XIV. Mean while Manius on the lower ground had <lb/>
            attacked the fortifications in the pass with his entire <lb/>
            force. Antiochus was struck on the mouth with a stone <lb/>
            which knocked out several of his teeth, and the pain of <lb/>
            his wound compelled him to wheel round his horse and <lb/>
            retreat. His troops nowhere withstood the Romans, but, <lb/>
            although they had endless means of escape by roads where <lb/>
            they could scarcely be followed, yet they crowded through <lb/>
            the narrow pass with deep marshy ground on the one hand <lb/>
            and inaccessible rocks upon the other, and there trampled <lb/>
            each other to death for fear of the swords of the Romans.</p>
          <p>Cato never seems to have been sparing of his own <lb/>
            praise, and thought that great deeds required to be told in <lb/>
            boastful language. He gives a very pompous account of <lb/>
            this battle, and says that all those who saw him pursuing <lb/>
            and cutting down the enemy felt that Cato did not owe so <lb/>
            much to the Romans, as the Romans owed to Cato. He <lb/>
            also says that the consul Manius immediately after the <lb/>
            victory was won, enfolded him for a long time in a close <lb/>
            embrace, and loudly declared that neither he nor all the <lb/>
            Roman people could ever do as much for Cato as he had <lb/>
            that day done for them. He was sent immediately after <lb/>
            the battle to bear the news of the victory to Rome, and <lb/>
            reached Brundusium after a prosperous voyage.</p><pb n="113"/>
            
          <p>From that place he drove in one day to Talentum, and <lb/>
            in four more days reached Rome with the news, on the <lb/>
            fifth day after his landing. His arrival filled the whole <lb/>
            city with feasting and rejoicing, and made the Roman <lb/>
            people believe that there was no nation in the world which <lb/>
            could resist their arms.</p>
          <p>XV. Of Cato's warlike exploits these which we have <lb/>
            related are the most remarkable. In his political life he <lb/>
            seems to have thought one of his most important duties <lb/>
            to be the impeachment and prosecution of those whom he <lb/>
            thought to be bad citizens. He himself attacked many <lb/>
            persons, and aided and encouraged others in doing so, a <lb/>
            notable example being his conduct towards Scipio in the <lb/>
            affair of Petillius. However, as Scipio was a man of noble <lb/>
            birth and great spirit, he treated the attack made upon <lb/>
            him with contempt, and Cato, perceiving that he could <lb/>
            not succeed in getting him condemned to death, desisted <lb/>
            from annoying him. But he was active in obtaining the <lb/>
            condemnation of Scipio's brother Lucius, who was adjudged <lb/>
            to pay a heavy fine, which was beyond his means to pro­ <lb/>
            vide, so that he had nearly been cast into prison, but was <lb/>
            set free by the intervention of the tribunes of the people.</p>
          <p>It is related of him that he once met in the forum a <lb/>
            young man who had just succeeded in obtaining the dis­ <lb/>
            franchisement, by an action at law, of an enemy of his <lb/>
            father, who was dead. Cato took him by the hand and <lb/>
            laid, " Thus ought men to honour their parents when they <lb/>
            die, not with the blood of lambs and kids, but with the <lb/>
            tears and condemnation of their enemies." He himself is <lb/>
            said to have been the defendant in nearly fifty actions, <lb/>
            the last of which was tried when he was eighty-six years <lb/>
            of age: on which occasion he uttered that well-known <lb/>
            saying, that it was hard for a man who -had lived in one <lb/>
            generation to be obliged to defend himself before another. <lb/>
            And this was not the end of his litigations, for four years <lb/>
            later, when at the age of ninety, he impeached Servius <lb/>
            Galba. Indeed his life, like that of Nestor, seems to have <lb/>
            reached over three generations. He, as had been related, <lb/>
            was a bitter political opponent of Scipio Africanus the <lb/>
            Great, and he continued his enmity to Scipio's adopted <lb/>
            son, called Scipio the Younger, who was really the son of <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="114"/>
            Æmilius Paulus, the conqueror of Perseus and the <lb/>
            Macedonians.</p>
          <p>XVI. Ten years after his consulship, Cato became a <lb/>
            candidate for the office of censor. This is the highest <lb/>
            dignity to which a Roman can aspire, and may be regarded <lb/>
            as the goal of political life. Its powers are very extensive, <lb/>
            and it is especially concerned with the regulation of <lb/>
            public morals, and the mode of life of the citizens of Rome. <lb/>
            The Romans thought that none of a man's actions, his <lb/>
            marriage, his family, his mode of life, his very entertain­ <lb/>
            ments, ought to be uncontrolled, and managed accord­ <lb/>
            ing to his own will and pleasure. They considered that a <lb/>
            man's true character was much more clearly shown by his <lb/>
            .private life than by his public behaviour, and were wont <lb/>
            to choose two citizens, one a patrician, and the other a <lb/>
            plebeian, whose duty it was to watch over the morals of <lb/>
            the people, and check any tendency to licentiousness or <lb/>
            extravagance. These officers they called censors, and they <lb/>
            had power to deprive a Roman knight of his horse, and <lb/>
            to expel men of loose and disorderly life from the Senate. <lb/>
            They also took a census of property, and kept a register <lb/>
            of the various tribes and classes of the citizens ; and they <lb/>
            likewise exercised various other important powers. Cato's <lb/>
            candidature was opposed by nearly all the most dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished members of the Senate, for, the patricians <lb/>
            viewed him with especial dislike, regarding it as an insult <lb/>
            to the nobility that men of obscure birth should attain to <lb/>
            the highest honours in the state, while all those who <lb/>
            were conscious of any private vices or departures from <lb/>
            the ways of their fathers, feared the severities of one who, <lb/>
            they knew, would be harsh and inexorable when in power.</p>
          <p>These classes consequently combined together against <lb/>
            Cato, and put up no less than seven candidates to contest <lb/>
            the censorship with him, and endeavoured to soothe the <lb/>
            people by holding out to them hopes of a lenient censor, <lb/>
            as though that were what they required. Cato on the <lb/>
            other hand would not relax his severity in the least, but <lb/>
            threatened evil doers in his speeches from the rostra, and <lb/>
            insisted that the city required a most searching reforma­ <lb/>
            tion. He told the people that if they were wise, they <lb/>
            would choose not the most agreeable, but the most <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            thorough physicians to perform this operation for them, <lb/>
            and that these would be himself and Valerius Flaccus ; <lb/>
            for with him as a colleague he imagined that he might <lb/>
            make some progress in the work of destroying, by knife <lb/>
            and cautery, the hydra of luxury and effeminacy. Of the <lb/>
            other candidates he said that he saw that each one was <lb/>
            eager to get the office and fill it badly, because he was <lb/>
            afraid of those who could fill it well. The Roman <lb/>
            people on this occasion showed itself so truly great and <lb/>
            worthy to be courted by great men, as not to be <lb/>
            alarmed at the earnest severity of Cato; but, setting <lb/>
            aside all those plausible candidates who promised merely <lb/>
            to consult their pleasure, elected Cato and Valerius censors. <lb/>
            It seemed, indeed, as if Cato, instead of being a candidate <lb/>
            for election, was already in office and issuing his commands <lb/>
            to the people, which were at once obeyed.</p>
          <p>XVII. As soon as he was elected, Cato appointed his <lb/>
            friend and colleague, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, chief of the <lb/>
            Senate. He expelled several senators, amongst whom was <lb/>
            Lucius Quintius, who had been consul seven years before, <lb/>
            and, which was even a greater distinction than the consul­ <lb/>
            ship, was the brother of Titus Quintius Flamininus, the <lb/>
            conqueror of Philip. He was expelled from the Senate for <lb/>
            the following reason. Lucius had a favourite boy who <lb/>
            never left his person, and followed him even on his <lb/>
            campaigns. This boy had more power and received greater <lb/>
            attention than the most trusty of his friends and relatives. <lb/>
            Now, when Lucius was governor of a province as pro­ <lb/>
            consul, this boy once, at a drinking party, was flattering <lb/>
            him over his wine, saying that Although there was <lb/>
            going to be a show of gladiators at Rome, yet I did not <lb/>
            stay to see it, but came out here to you, although I longed <lb/>
            to see a man killed." Lucius, to please him, answered in <lb/>
            the same tone, " If that be all, do not lie there and fret, <lb/>
            for I will soon gratify your wish." He at once ordered a <lb/>
            condemned criminal to be brought into the banqueting <lb/>
            hall, and one of his servants to stand by him with an axe, <lb/>
            and then again asked his favourite whether he wished to <lb/>
            see a man struck dead. When the boy said that he did, <lb/>
            he bade the servant cut off the man's head. This is the <lb/>
            account which most writers give of the transaction, and <note type="footnote"> I 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            it is that which Cicero introduces Cato as relating in his <lb/>
            dialogue " On Old Age but Livy says that the man who <lb/>
            was put to death was a Gaulish deserter, and that Lucius <lb/>
            did not employ a servant, but slew him with his own <lb/>
            hand, and this is the version which Cato has followed in <lb/>
            his written account of the matter. When Cato discussed <lb/>
            what took place at this wine party, Lucius endeavoured to <lb/>
            deny it, but on being challenged to state exactly what <lb/>
            happened he refused to answer. He was most justly <lb/>
            condemned to lose his right as a senator; but afterwards, <lb/>
            when some spectacle was being witnessed in the theatre, <lb/>
            he walked past the place reserved for men of consular <lb/>
            rank, and sat down in the humblest seat of all, which so <lb/>
            moved the people to compassion, that they forced him by <lb/>
            their clamour to resume his former seat, thus as far as <lb/>
            they were able reversing the sentence upon him and <lb/>
            condoning his offence.</p>
          <p>Cato expelled another senator, who was thought likely <lb/>
            to be soon elected consul, named Manilius, because he had <lb/>
            kissed his wife in the daytime in the presence of his <lb/>
            daughter. He himself said that his own wife never <lb/>
            embraced him except when it thundered loudly, and added <lb/>
            by way of joke, that he was happy when Jupiter was <lb/>
            pleased to thunder.</p>
          <p>XVIII. His conduct in depriving of his horse Lucius <lb/>
            Scipio, the brother of Scipio Africanus, a man who had <lb/>
            been decreed a triumph, was censured, as being merely <lb/>
            prompted by private spite ; as he seemed merely to do <lb/>
            it in order to insult Scipio Africanus after his death. <lb/>
            But what caused the greatest dissatisfaction were his re­ <lb/>
            strictions on luxury. This he could not attack openly, <lb/>
            because it had taken such deep root among the people, <lb/>
            but he caused all clothes, carriages, women's ornaments, <lb/>
            and furniture, which exceeded fifteen hundred drachmas <lb/>
            in value to be rated at ten times their value and taxed <lb/>
            accordingly, as he thought that those who possessed the <lb/>
            most valuable property ought to contribute most largely <lb/>
            to the revenues of the state. In addition to this he <lb/>
            imposed a tax on all citizens of three copper ases for every <lb/>
            thousand, in order that those who were burdened with <lb/>
            an excessive taxation on objects of luxury, when they saw <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            persons of frugal and simple habits paying so small a tail <lb/>
            on the same income, might cease from their extravagance. <lb/>
            This measure gained him the hatred of those who were <lb/>
            taxed so heavily for their luxuries, and of those who, to <lb/>
            avoid excessive taxation, were obliged to give up their <lb/>
            luxuries. Most persons are as much irritated at losing <lb/>
            the means of displaying their wealth as at losing their <lb/>
            wealth itself, and it is in superfluities, not in necessaries, <lb/>
            that wealth can be displayed. This is what is said to <lb/>
            have so much surprised Ariston the Philosopher, that men <lb/>
            should consider those persons fortunate who possess what <lb/>
            is superfluous, rather than those who possess what is <lb/>
            necessary and useful. Skopas the Thessalian also, when <lb/>
            one of his friends asked him for something which was <lb/>
            not particularly useful to him, and added, that he did not <lb/>
            ask for anything necessary or useful, answered, " Indeed, <lb/>
            it is in these useless and superfluous things that my <lb/>
            wealth chiefly consists." For the desire of wealth is not <lb/>
            connected with any of our physical necessities, and is <lb/>
            an artificial want arising from too much regard for the <lb/>
            opinion of the vulgar.</p>
          <p>XXX. Cato paid no attention to those who blamed his <lb/>
            conduct, and proceeded to measures of still greater <lb/>
            severity. He cut off the water-pipes, by which water was <lb/>
            conveyed from the public fountains into private houses <lb/>
            and gardens, destroyed all houses that encroached upon <lb/>
            the public streets, lowered the price of contracts for <lb/>
            public works, and farmed out the public revenues for the <lb/>
            highest possible rents. All this made him still more un- <lb/>
            -popular. Titus Flami ninus and Mends attacked him, <lb/>
            and prevailed upon the Senate to annul the contracts <lb/>
            which he had made for the building of temples and the <lb/>
            construction of public works, on the ground that they <lb/>
            were disadvantageous to the state. They also encouraged <lb/>
            the boldest of the tribunes to proseonte him before <lb/>
            the people, and to fine him two talents. He likewise <lb/>
            received violent opposition in the matter of the basilica, <lb/>
            or public hall, which he built at the public expense in the <lb/>
            forum below the senate house, and which was called the <lb/>
            Basilica Porcia.</p>
          <p>In spite of all this, his censorship seems to have been <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            wonderfully popular with the Roman people. When <lb/>
            they placed his statue in the Temple of Hygieia, they did <lb/>
            not enumerate his campaigns or triumphs in the inscrip­ <lb/>
            tion on the base, but wrote what we may translate as <lb/>
            follows: " This statue was erected to Cato because, when <lb/>
            Censor, finding the state of Rome corrupt and degenerate, <lb/>
            he, by introducing wise regulations and virtuous discipline, <lb/>
            restored it."</p>
          <p>At one time Cato affected to despise those who took <lb/>
            pleasure in receiving honours of this kind, and used to <lb/>
            say that while they plumed themselves on being repre­ <lb/>
            sented in brass or marble, they forgot that the fairest <lb/>
            image was that of himself which every citizen bore in his <lb/>
            heart. When any one expressed surprise at his not having <lb/>
            a statue, when so many obscure men had obtained that <lb/>
            honour, he answered, " I had rather that men should ask <lb/>
            why I have no statue, than that they should ask why I <lb/>
            have one." A good citizen, he said, ought not even to <lb/>
            allow himself to be praised, unless the state were benefited <lb/>
            thereby. He has glorified himself by recording that <lb/>
            when men were detected in any fault, they would excuse <lb/>
            themselves by saying that they must be pardoned if they <lb/>
            did anything amiss, for they were -not Catos: and that <lb/>
            those who endeavoured clumsily to imitate his proceed­ <lb/>
            ings were called left-handed Catos. Also he states that <lb/>
            the Senate looked to him in great emergencies as men in <lb/>
            a storm look to the pilot, and that when he was not <lb/>
            present, they frequently postponed their more important <lb/>
            business. This indeed is confirmed by other writers : for <lb/>
            he had great influence in Rome on account of his virtuous <lb/>
            life, his eloquence, and his great age.</p>
          <p>XX. He was a good father and a good husband, and <lb/>
            was in his private life an economist of no ordinary kind, <lb/>
            as he did not despise money-making or regard it as <lb/>
            unworthy of his abilities. For this reason I think I <unclear/> <lb/>
            ught to relate how well he managed his private affairs. <lb/>
            He married a wife who was well born, though not rich ; <lb/>
            for he thought that though all classes might possess equally <lb/>
            good sense, yet that a woman of noble birth would be <lb/>
            more ashamed of doing wrong, and therefore more likely <lb/>
            to encourage her husband to do right. He used to say <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            that a man who beat his wife or his children laid sacri­ <lb/>
            legious hands on the holiest of things. He also said that <lb/>
            he had rather be a good husband than a great statesman, <lb/>
            and that what he especially admired in Sokrates the <lb/>
            Philosopher was his patience and kindness in bearing <lb/>
            with his ill-tempered wife and his stupid children. When <lb/>
            his son was born, he thought that nothing except the <lb/>
            most important business of state ought to prevent his <lb/>
            being present while his wife washed the child and <lb/>
            wrapped it in swaddling clothes. His wife suckled the <lb/>
            child herself; nay she often gave her breast to the <lb/>
            children of her slaves, and so taught them to have a <lb/>
            brotherly regard for her own son.</p>
          <p>As soon as he was able to learn, Cato himself taught <lb/>
            him his letters, although he had a clever slave named <lb/>
            Chilon, who taught many children to read. He himself <lb/>
            declares that he did not wish a slave to reprove his son or <lb/>
            pull his ears because he was slow at learning. He taught <lb/>
            the boy to read, and instructed him also in the Roman <lb/>
            law and in bodily exercises; not confining himself to <lb/>
            teaching him to hurl the javelin, to fight in complete <lb/>
            armour, and to ride, but also to use his fists in boxing, to <lb/>
            endure the extremes of heat and cold, and to swim through <lb/>
            swiftly-flowing and eddying rivers. He tells us that he <lb/>
            himself wrote books on history with his own hands in <lb/>
            large letters, that the boy might start in life with a <lb/>
            useful knowledge of what his forefathers had done, and <lb/>
            he was as careful not to use an indecent expression before <lb/>
            his son as he would have been before the vestal virgins. <lb/>
            He never bathed with him; which indeed seems to have <lb/>
            been customary at Rome, as even fathers-in-law scrupled <lb/>
            to bathe naked before their sons-in-law. In later times, <lb/>
            however, the Romans learned from the Greeks the habit of <lb/>
            bathing naked, and have taught the Greeks to do so even <lb/>
            in the presence of women.</p>
          <p>While Cato was engaged in this great work of forming <lb/>
            his son's character and completing his education he found <lb/>
            him eager to learn, and able to make great progress from <lb/>
            his natural ability but he appeared so weak and delicate <lb/>
            that his father was obliged to relax the stern simplicity <lb/>
            of his own life in his favour, and allow him some indul­ <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            gences in diet. The young man, although so weakly, yet <lb/>
            proved himself a good soldier in the wars, and distin­ <lb/>
            guished himself greatly in the battle in which Æmilius <lb/>
            Paulus defeated King Perseus. Afterwards, upon the <lb/>
            same day, he either had his sword struck from his hand or <lb/>
            let it fall from weakness, and in his grief at the loss got <lb/>
            together some of his friends and prevailed upon them <lb/>
            again to charge the enemy. With great exertions they <lb/>
            succeeded in clearing a space, and at length discovered his <lb/>
            sword under a great heap of arms and corpses of friends <lb/>
            and foes alike which were piled upon it. Paulus, the <lb/>
            commander-in-chief, was much pleased with the youth's <lb/>
            eagerness to regain his sword, and sent a letter to Cato <lb/>
            in which ho spoke in the highest terms of the courage <lb/>
            and honourable feeling which he had shown. He after­ <lb/>
            wards married Tertia, the sister of Scipio, and had the <lb/>
            gratification of pleasing his father as much as himself by <lb/>
            thus allying himself with one of the noblest families in <lb/>
            Rome. Thus was Cato rewarded for the care which he <lb/>
            had bestowed upon his son's education.</p>
          <p>XXI. He possessed a large number of slaves, and when <lb/>
            captives were for sale he always purchased those who <lb/>
            were young, and who, like colts or puppies, could be <lb/>
            taught and trained to their duties. None of them ever <lb/>
            entered any house but his own, unless sent thither by Cato <lb/>
            or by his wife: and if they were asked what Cato was doing, <lb/>
            they always answered that they did not know. His rule <lb/>
            was, that a slave ought either to be doing his business or to <lb/>
            be asleep; and he greatly preferred good sleepers, as he <lb/>
            thought that they were more easy tempered than wakeful <lb/>
            persons, and also that men who had slept well were <lb/>
            better able to work than those who had lain awake. <lb/>
            Knowing that love affairs lead slaves into mischief more <lb/>
            than anything else, he permitted them to consort with <lb/>
            his own female slaves at a fixed price, but forbade them <lb/>
            to have anything to do with other women.</p>
          <p>Cato in his earlier days, being a poor man, and always <lb/>
            employed in service in the field, never complained of any <lb/>
            thing that he ate, and thought it most disgraceful to <lb/>
            quarrel with his servant for not having pleased his palate. <lb/>
            Subsequently, however, as he bicame richer, he used to <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            invite his friends and colleagues to dinner, and after the <lb/>
            repast was wont to punish with the scourge those servants <lb/>
            who had made mistakes or cooked the food badly. He <lb/>
            always endeavoured to establish some quarrel amongst his <lb/>
            slaves, so that they might plot against one another, instead <lb/>
            of combining against himself; and when any of them <lb/>
            appeared to have committed any crime deserving to be <lb/>
            punished by death, the offender was formally tried, and <lb/>
            if found guilty, was put to death in the presence of all his <lb/>
            fellow-servants.</p>
          <p>As Cato grew more eager to make money, he declared <lb/>
            that farming was more an amusement than a source of <lb/>
            income, and preferred investing his money in remunerative <lb/>
            undertakings, such as marshes that required draining, hot <lb/>
            springs, establishments for washing and cleaning clothes, <lb/>
            land which would produce an income by pasturage or by <lb/>
            the sale of wood, and the like, which afforded him a <lb/>
            considerable revenue, and one which, as he said, not <lb/>
            Jupiter himself could injure, meaning that he was not <lb/>
            dependent upon the weather for his income, as farmers are. <lb/>
            He also used to deal in marine assurance, which is thought <lb/>
            to be a most dangerous form of investment, which he <lb/>
            managed in the following manner. For the sake of <lb/>
            security he made those who wished to borrow money <lb/>
            form themselves into an association of fifty persons, <lb/>
            representing as many ships, and held one share in the <lb/>
            undertaking himself, which was managed by his freedman <lb/>
            Quintio, who himself used to sail in the ships of the <lb/>
            association and transact their mercantile business.</p>
          <p>He used to lend money to his slaves, if they desired it. <lb/>
            They used with the money to buy young slaves, teach <lb/>
            them a trade at Cato's expense for a year, and then <lb/>
            dispose of them. Many of these Cato retained in his own <lb/>
            service, paying the price offered by the highest bidder, <lb/>
            and deducting from it the original cost of the slave. <lb/>
            When endeavouring to encourage his son to act in a <lb/>
            similar manner, he used to say that it was not the part of <lb/>
            a man, but of a lone woman, to diminish one's capital; <lb/>
            and once, with an excessive exaggeration, he said that <lb/>
            the most glorious and godlike man was he who on h a <lb/>
            death was found to have earned more than he inherited.</p><pb n="122"/>
            
          <p>XXII. When he was an old man, Karneades the <lb/>
            academic, and Diogenes the stoic philosopher, came as <lb/>
            ambassadors to Rome on the part of the Athenians, to beg <lb/>
            that they might not be forced to pay a fine of five hundred <lb/>
            talents which had been imposed upon them in consequence <lb/>
            of an action at law, brought against the Athenians by <lb/>
            the people of Oropus, before the people of Sikyon as judges, <lb/>
            having been allowed to go against them by default. Such <lb/>
            of the Roman youths as had any taste for literature <lb/>
            frequented the society of these men, and took great interest <lb/>
            in hearing their discussions. They were especially de­ <lb/>
            lighted with Karneades, a man of great and recognised <lb/>
            ability, who obtained large and enthusiastic audiences at <lb/>
            his lectures, and filled the whole city with his fame. <lb/>
            Nothing was talked of except how a single Greek with <lb/>
            wonderful powers of eloquence and persuasion had so <lb/>
            bewitched the youth of Rome that they forsook all other <lb/>
            pleasures, and plunged wildly into philosophic speculations. <lb/>
            The greater part of the citizens were well pleased with <lb/>
            this, and looked on with great satisfaction at their sons' <lb/>
            study of Greek literature, and their intimacy with such <lb/>
            celebrated men ; but Cato, when the taste for philosophy <lb/>
            first sprang up in Rome, was vexed at it, and feared that <lb/>
            the young men might become more eager to gain distinc­ <lb/>
            tion by fluent speaking than by warlike exploits. How­ <lb/>
            ever, when the fame of the philosophers increased, and a <lb/>
            distinguished man, Caius Acilius,- at the general request, <lb/>
            translated their first lectures to the Senate, Cato decided <lb/>
            that the philosophers must at once be conducted with all <lb/>
            due honours out of the city. He came to the Senate and <lb/>
            made a speech, in which he blamed them for having <lb/>
            allowed an embassy to remain so long at Rome without <lb/>
            accomplishing its purpose, although nothing was easier <lb/>
            than for it to gain its point. He called upon them there­ <lb/>
            fore, to decide as soon as possible and come to a vote upon <lb/>
            the matter about which this embassy was come, in order <lb/>
            that these philosophers might return to their schools and <lb/>
            instruct. the young men of Greece, while those of Rome <lb/>
            might, as before, give their attention to the laws and <lb/>
            the magi trates.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Cato acted thus, not as some writers imagine, <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            from any private quarrel with Karneades, but because he <lb/>
            disliked the philosophy altogether, and from a feeling of <lb/>
            patriotism, regarded all Greek literature and methods <lb/>
            of education with hatred and contempt. He used to say <lb/>
            that Sokrates was a wordy and dangerous man, who <lb/>
            endeavoured in his own way to make himself supreme in <lb/>
            Athens, by destroying the best of the national customs <lb/>
            and teaching the citizens to hold opinions at variance with <lb/>
            the laws. He ridiculed Isokrates as a teacher of rhetoric, <lb/>
            saying that his disciples stayed with him so long learning <lb/>
            their profession, that they were only able to practice <lb/>
            what they had learned in the court where Minos sat as <lb/>
            judge in the next world. In his endeavours to dissuade <lb/>
            his son from the study of Greek literature, he abused the <lb/>
            privileges of old age so far as to utter a prophecy that <lb/>
            the Romans would ruin their empire by too intimate an <lb/>
            acquaintance with the arts of Greece. Time, however, <lb/>
            has proved this to be a mere empty slander, seeing that <lb/>
            since then Rome has risen to a wonderful height of <lb/>
            power and glory, and yet is thoroughly familiar with <lb/>
            Greek writings and studies. Cato not only disliked the <lb/>
            Greek philosophers, but also looked with suspicion on <lb/>
            the Greek physicians who then practised at Rome. He had <lb/>
            heard some story about Hippokrates, who, when the king <lb/>
            of Persia offered him a large sum of money if he would <lb/>
            come to Persia, answered that he never would give his <lb/>
            services to barbarians who were the enemies of Greece. <lb/>
            Cato used to say that all Greek physicians had sworn an <lb/>
            oath to act like Hippokrates, and warned his son never <lb/>
            tc have any dealings with any of them. He himself had <lb/>
            a book full of recipes, according to which he used to <lb/>
            physick and regulate the diet of any who fell sick in his <lb/>
            house, being careful never to allow the patient to fast, <lb/>
            but making him eat salad, with ducks, pigeons, and hares, <lb/>
            which he said were light food, and suitable for sick persons, <lb/>
            except that it often happened that those who ate of them <lb/>
            suffered from nightmares. He used to declare that by <lb/>
            following this regimen, he kept both himself and all his <lb/>
            household in perfect health.</p>
          <p>XXIV. He seems to have been justly rewarded for his <lb/>
            quackery, for he lost both his wife and his son by sickness. <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            He himself, however, being of an iron constitution, made a <lb/>
            second marriage, in spite of his advanced age, being led <lb/>
            into it by the following circumstances. After the death of <lb/>
            his wife he arranged a marriage between his son and the <lb/>
            daughter of Æmilius Paulus, who was the sister of Scipio. <lb/>
            He himself meanwhile solaced himself by an intrigue with <lb/>
            a maid-servant who visited him by stealth. However, in a <lb/>
            small house with a daughter-in-law in it this could not be <lb/>
            kept secret; and one day when this woman was insolently <lb/>
            swaggering into his father's bedchamber, young Cato was <lb/>
            observed by the old man to glance at her with bitter hatred <lb/>
            and then turn away in disgust. As soon as Cato perceived <lb/>
            that his conduct vexed his children, he said not a word, <lb/>
            but went into the forum with his friends, as was his wont. <lb/>
            Here one Salonius, who was one of his under-secretaries, <lb/>
            met him and began to pay his respects to him, when Cato <lb/>
            asked him in a loud voice whether he had provided a hus­ <lb/>
            band for his daughter. On the man's replying that he <lb/>
            had not, and would not presume to do so without consult­ <lb/>
            ing him, Cato replied, " Well, I, by Jupiter, have found <lb/>
            a very suitable person to marry her, unless his age be any <lb/>
            objection: for he is very passable in all respects except <lb/>
            that he is very old." As Salonius upon this bade him <lb/>
            carry out his intention and marry the girl to whomsoever <lb/>
            he pleased, seeing that she was his client- and he was her <lb/>
            patron, Cato without a moment's delay told him that he <lb/>
            wished to marry the girl himself. This proposal at first, <lb/>
            as might be expected, astonished the secretary, who had <lb/>
            thought that a man at Cato's time of life was very un­ <lb/>
            likely to marry, and had never dreamed that his humble <lb/>
            family would be allied with a house which could boast of <lb/>
            consulates and triumphs; but as he saw that Cato was in <lb/>
            earnest he gladly accepted his offer. While the preparations <lb/>
            for the marriage were in progress, young Cato, taking his <lb/>
            relatives with him, went and inquired of his father whether <lb/>
            he had reproached or annoyed him in any way, that he was <lb/>
            putting a mother-in-law over him. Cato at this question <lb/>
            cried out aloud, “ Hush, my son; I approve of all that <lb/>
            you have done, and find no fault with you: I only desire <lb/>
            to leave behind me more sons of my race, and more citizens <note type="footnote"> * On the nature of these relations, see‘ Smith's Dict. of Aut,' a. v. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            to serve the state." It is said that this remark was first <lb/>
            made by Peisistratus, the despot of Athens, when, although <lb/>
            he had sons grown up, he married Timonassa of Argos, by <lb/>
            whom we are told that he had two sons, Iophon and Thes­ <lb/>
            salus. Cato also had a son by his second marriage, whom <lb/>
            he named Salonius after his mother. His eldest son died <lb/>
            during his prætorship. Cato often mentions him in his <lb/>
            writings as having been a brave and good man, but is said <lb/>
            to have borne his loss with philosophic resignation, and to <lb/>
            have taken as keen an interest in politics as before. He <lb/>
            did not, as was. afterwards done by Lucius Lucullus or <lb/>
            Metellus Pius, abandon public life when he grew old, and <lb/>
            think that it was a burden to take part in politics; still <lb/>
            less did he imitate Scipio Africanus, who some years before <lb/>
            had proudly turned his back on the people who grudged <lb/>
            him the glory he had won, and spent the rest of his life <lb/>
            in ease and retirement. Some one is said to have told <lb/>
            Dionysius of Syracuse that an absolute monarchy is the <lb/>
            best thing for a man to die in, and so Cato seemed to think <lb/>
            that political life was the best for him to grow old in, <lb/>
            while he amused himself in his leisure moments by writ­ <lb/>
            ing and farming.</p>
          <p>XXV. He compiled works on various subjects, especially <lb/>
            on history. Farming he applied himself to when very <lb/>
            young, on account of his poverty, for he himself tells us <lb/>
            that he had only two sources of income, farming and fru­ <lb/>
            gality. In later life he derived both amusement and <lb/>
            instruction from watching the operations of agriculture, <lb/>
            and he has written a farmer's manual, in which there is <lb/>
            even an account of how to cook cakes and preserve fruits, <lb/>
            so desirous was he to show a thorough knowledge of every <lb/>
            subject. His table was never so well served as when he <lb/>
            was in the country ; for he used to invite all his friends <lb/>
            and acquaintances from the neighbourhood, and make him­ <lb/>
            self very agreeable to them, as he was a pleasant companion <lb/>
            not only to men of his own age, but also to the young, <lb/>
            having in the course of his long life seen and heard from <lb/>
            others much that was interesting and curious. He re­ <lb/>
            garded the table as the best means of forming friendships, <lb/>
            and when dining used to praise the good without stint, <lb/>
            but never would allow the names of worthless men to be <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            mentioned, either by way of praise or blame, at his enter <lb/>
            tainments.</p>
          <p>XXVI. The last of his political acts is said to have <lb/>
            been the destruction of Carthage. This was actually <lb/>
            brought to pass by Scipio the Younger, but it was chiefly <lb/>
            owing to the counsels of Cato that the war was begun. <lb/>
            His reason for insisting on its destruction was this. He <lb/>
            was sent on a mission to Africa to investigate the grounds <lb/>
            of a quarrel which existed between the Carthaginians and <lb/>
            Masinissa, the king of the Numidians. Masinissa had <lb/>
            always been the friend of Rome, whereas the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians, after their defeat by Scipio, had been subjected <lb/>
            to hard conditions, having lost their sovereignty over the <lb/>
            neighbouring tribes, and having been compelled to pay a <lb/>
            large sum as tribute to Rome. Cato, however, found the <lb/>
            city, not, as the Romans imagined it to be, crushed by its <lb/>
            recent overthrow, but full of young men, overflowing with <lb/>
            wealth, well provided with arms and munitions of war, <lb/>
            and, as may be expected, full of warlike spirit. He <lb/>
            concluded that it was no time for the Romans to arbitrate <lb/>
            about the grievances of Masinissa and his Numidians, but <lb/>
            that, unless they at once destroyed a city which bore them <lb/>
            an undying hatred and which had recovered its strength <lb/>
            in an incredibly short space of time, they would have as <lb/>
            much:tofear from Carthage as ever. He quickly returned <lb/>
            home, and pointed out to the Senate that the former <lb/>
            defeats and misfortunes suffered by the Carthaginians had <lb/>
            not really broken their strength so much as they had <lb/>
            dissipated their overweening self-confidence, and that in <lb/>
            the late war they had not lost so much in strength as they <lb/>
            had gained in experience and skill. Their present <lb/>
            difference with the Numidians was, he urged, merely a <lb/>
            prelude to an attack upon Rome, with which city they <lb/>
            kept up the fiction of a peace which would soon upon <lb/>
            a suitable opportunity be exchanged for war.</p>
          <p>XXVII. After these words it is said that Cato threw <lb/>
            down in the senate house some ripe figs which he had <lb/>
            brought on purpose; and when the senators admired <lb/>
            their size and beauty, he remarked that" the country which <lb/>
            produced this fruit is only three days' sail distant from <lb/>
            Rome." Another and a mor violent method of forcing <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            the Romans to attack them was his habit, when giving <lb/>
            his opinion on any subject whatever, to append the words, <lb/>
            “ And I also am of opinion that Carthage must be de­ <lb/>
            stroyed." On the other hand, Publius Scipio, called Nasica, <lb/>
            used to end all his speeches with the words, "And I <lb/>
            further am of opinion that Carthage should be left alone." <lb/>
            Scipio's reason for this was that he perceived that the <lb/>
            lower classes in Rome, elated by success, were becoming <lb/>
            difficult for the Senate to in anage, and practically forced <lb/>
            the State to adopt whatever measures they chose. He <lb/>
            thought that to have this fear of Carthage kept constantly <lb/>
            hanging over them would be a salutary check upon the <lb/>
            insolence of the people, and he thought that although <lb/>
            Carthage was too weak to conquer the Romans, yet that <lb/>
            it was too strong to be despised by them. Cato, on the other <lb/>
            hand, thought it a dangerous thing that, at a time when <lb/>
            the Romans were giddy and drunk with power, they <lb/>
            should leave in existence a city which always had been <lb/>
            important, and which now, sobered by defeat, was biding <lb/>
            its time and lying in wait for a favourable opportunity <lb/>
            to avenge itself. He argued that it was better to set the <lb/>
            Romans free from any fear of foreign states, in order that <lb/>
            they might be able to devote themselves uninterruptedly <lb/>
            to the task of political reform.</p>
          <p>These are said to have been Cato's reasons for urging <lb/>
            his countrymen to begin the third and last Punic war. He <lb/>
            died as soon as the war was begun, leaving a prophecy <lb/>
            that it would be finished by a young man who was then <lb/>
            serving as military tribune, and who had given remarkable <lb/>
            pi oofs of courage and generalship. Cato, on hearing of <lb/>
            his exploits is said to have quoted Homer's line­ <lb/>
            “ He alone has solid wisdom; all the rest are shadows vain."</p>
          <p>This opinion Scipio soon confirmed by his actions.</p>
          <p>Cato left one son by his second wife, who, as has been <lb/>
            said, was named Salonius, and one grandson, the child of <lb/>
            his eldest son who was dead. Salonius died during his <lb/>
            prætorship, but his son Marcus became consul. This <lb/>
            man was the grandfather of Cato the Philosopher, who <lb/>
            was one of the foremost men of his day in courage and <lb/>
            ability.</p><pb n="128"/>

            <title type="sub">COMPARISON OF ARISTEIDES AND CATO.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Now that we have related all the important events of <lb/>
            each of these men's lives, it will be seen that the points <lb/>
            in which they differ are very trifling when compared with <lb/>
            those in which they agree. If, however, we are to take <lb/>
            each of their qualities separately, as one would in com­ <lb/>
            paring two speeches or two pictures, we observe that they <lb/>
            both agree in having begun life in a humble station, and <lb/>
            having won political distinction and power by sheer ability <lb/>
            and force of character. It is true that Aristeides rose to <lb/>
            power at a period when Athens was poor, and when the <lb/>
            orators and generals whom he attacked were men whose <lb/>
            means were little superior to his own; for the men of <lb/>
            greatest incomes at that time were assessed as having five <lb/>
            hundred bushels of wet or dry produce a year, while the <lb/>
            next class, that of the knights, had three hundred, and <lb/>
            the lowest, or those who could afford to keep a yoke of <lb/>
            oxen, had only two hundred. Cato, on the other hand, <lb/>
            came from an obscure village and a rustic mode of life, <lb/>
            ,ind boldly launched himself upon the turbid sea of Roman <lb/>
            politics, although the days of Curius, Fabricius and Atilius <lb/>
            were long past, and Rome was not accustomed to find her <lb/>
            magistrates and party leaders in labouring men fresh from <lb/>
            the plough or the workshop, but in men of noble birth <lb/>
            and great wealth, who canvassed extensively, and bribed <lb/>
            heavily ; while the populace, insolent with the conscious­ <lb/>
            ness of power, were growing ripe for a revolt against the <lb/>
            governing class.</p>
          <p>It was a very different thing for Aristeides to have only <lb/>
            Themistokles for an antagonist, a man of no birth or <lb/>
            fortune (for it is said that he only possessed between three <lb/>
            and five talents when he first embarked on politics) and <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            for Cato to contend for the mastery with men like Scipio <lb/>
            Africanus, Sergius Galba, and Titus Quintius Flamininus, <lb/>
            with nothing to help him but his eloquent voice and his <lb/>
            good cause.</p>
          <p>II. Furthermore, Aristeides, both at Marathon and at <lb/>
            Platæa, acted as general with nine colleagues, while Cato <lb/>
            was elected one of the two consuls and afterwards one of <lb/>
            the two censors, though there were many other candidates <lb/>
            for both offices. Aristeides never conspicuously distin­ <lb/>
            guished himself, as the credit of the victory at Marathon <lb/>
            belongs to Miltiades, and that of Salamis to Themistokles, <lb/>
            while Herodotus tells us that Pausanias obtained the most <lb/>
            glorious success of all at Platæa, and even the second <lb/>
            place is disputed with Aristeides by Sophanes, Ameinias, <lb/>
            Kallimachus, and Kynægyrus, all of whom won great <lb/>
            glory in those battles. On the other hand, Cato not only <lb/>
            when consul gained the greatest credit, both by his wise <lb/>
            conduct, and his personal prowess in the Spanish war, but, <lb/>
            when at Thermopylae he was acting as tribune under <lb/>
            another person's command as consul, contributed mainly <lb/>
            to winning the victory by his flank movement, by which <lb/>
            he established himself in the rear of Antiochus while <lb/>
            that prince was intent upon the enemy in his front. This <lb/>
            victory, which was so manifestly due to Cato, had the <lb/>
            important result of driving the Asiatic troops out of Greece <lb/>
            back to their own country, and so of preparing the way <lb/>
            for Scipio's subsequent invasion of Asia.</p>
          <p>Neither of them were ever defeated in battle, but in <lb/>
            political matters Aristeides was overcome by his rival <lb/>
            Themistokles, who drove him into exile by ostracism, <lb/>
            while Cato held his own against all the greatest and most <lb/>
            influential men in Rome to the end of his life without once <lb/>
            being overthrown by them. He was often impeached, <lb/>
            and always acquitted, while he frequently succeeded in <lb/>
            his impeachments of others, using, both as a bulwark to <lb/>
            defend himself and as a weapon to attack others, his power <lb/>
            of speaking in public, which indeed is a quality more to <lb/>
            be relied upon than good fortune to protect a man from <lb/>
            suffering wrong. Antipater, in the account which he <lb/>
            wrote of the philosopher Aristotle after his death, observes <note type="footnote"> VOL. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            that besides his other qualities and accomplishments this <lb/>
            man had the power of persuasion.</p>
          <p>III. It is generally admitted that political virtue is the <lb/>
            highest to which a man can aspire, and of this, most think <lb/>
            domestic virtue to be a very important part; for as a city <lb/>
            is merely a collection of houses, the public virtue of the <lb/>
            state must be increased if it contain many well-regulated <lb/>
            households. Lykurgus, when he banished silver and <lb/>
            gold from Sparta, and gave his countrymen useless iron <lb/>
            money, did not wish to discourage good household manage­ <lb/>
            ment among them, but he removed the dangerous seduc­ <lb/>
            tions of wealth out of their reach, in order that they all <lb/>
            might enjoy a sufficiency of what was useful and necessary. <lb/>
            He saw, what no other legislator appears to have seen, <lb/>
            that the real danger to a commonwealth arises from the <lb/>
            poor and desperate rather than from the excessively rich.</p>
          <p>Now we have seen that Cato was as well able to manage <lb/>
            his household as to govern the state; for he improved his <lb/>
            fortune and became a teacher of household management <lb/>
            and husbandry to others, by, collecting much useful infor­ <lb/>
            mation on these matters. On the other hand, Aristeides <lb/>
            made his poverty a reproach to justice, which by his <lb/>
            example was made to seem a ruinous virtue which brought <lb/>
            men to want, and was totally useless to those who practised <lb/>
            it. Yet the poet Hesiod, when encouraging men to act <lb/>
            justly and manage their household affairs well, blames <lb/>
            idleness as the origin of injustice, and the same idea is <lb/>
            well stated in Homer's lines :­ <lb/>
            “ Work was never my delight, <lb/>
            Nor household cares, that breed up children bright; <lb/>
            But ever loved I ships with banks of oars, <lb/>
            And arrows keen, and weapons for the wars," <lb/>
            where we see that the same men neglect their duties at <lb/>
            home, and gain their living by injustice and piracy abroad. <lb/>
            The physicians tell us that oil is most useful, outwardly <lb/>
            used, and most harmful when taken inwardly; but it is <lb/>
            not true of the just man that he is most useful to his <lb/>
            friends, but useless to himself. It seems to me tc be a <lb/>
            blot on Aristeides' fame, if it be true that he could <lb/>
            not even provide money for his daughters' dowry or for <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            his own funeral expenses. The family of Cato for four <lb/>
            generations, supplied Rome with prætors and consuls, <lb/>
            for his grandchildren, and their children too, all rose to <lb/>
            the highest offices in the state ; while the hopeless poverty <lb/>
            of Aristeides, though he was the foremost man of his <lb/>
            time in Greece, reduced some of his family to the disreput­ <lb/>
            able profession of interpreting dreams, and forced others <lb/>
            to live on public charity, putting it quite out of their <lb/>
            power to emulate the glorious actions of their ancestor.</p>
          <p>IV. Some, indeed, may dispute this ; for it is true that <lb/>
            poverty is no disgrace in itself, but only when it is a proof <lb/>
            of indolence, extravagance, or folly. The poverty of a <lb/>
            laborious, upright, temperate statesman combines well <lb/>
            with his other virtues, and shows true greatness of mind : <lb/>
            for a man whose attention is given to little things, can <lb/>
            never succeed in doing great ones; nor can a man help <lb/>
            others if he is in need of help himself. A statesman <lb/>
            requires, not wealth, but contentment, in order that his <lb/>
            attention may not be diverted from public affairs by <lb/>
            his own cravings for useless luxuries. God alone is <lb/>
            entirely without wants, and we approach nearest to the <lb/>
            divine ideal when we can reduce our wants to the fewest <lb/>
            possible. Just as a healthy man requires neither excess of <lb/>
            clothing or of food, so a man's life and that of his family, <lb/>
            if properly regulated, can be maintained at a trifling <lb/>
            cost. His income, however, must exactly tally with his <lb/>
            requirements; for we cannot call that man contented who <lb/>
            earr s much, and spends little. He is a foolish man if he <lb/>
            troubles himself to amass what he cannot enjoy; while <lb/>
            he must be a miserable man if he is able to enjoy the use <lb/>
            of wealth, and yet through meanness of spirit forbids <lb/>
            himself its use.</p>
          <p>I would willingly put this question to Cato: " If we <lb/>
            ought to enjoy our wealth, why do you make a virtue of <lb/>
            simplicity of living when you are a rich man ? If, on <lb/>
            the other hand, it is a noble thing, as no doubt it is, to <lb/>
            eat common bread, to drink the same wine as our servants <lb/>
            and farm labourers do, and not to want fine clothes or <lb/>
            comfortable houses, then Aristeides and Epameinondas, <lb/>
            Manius Curius and Caius Fabricius were to be applauded <lb/>
            for their neglect of the wealth, whose use they rejected." <note type="footnote"> It 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            Surely it was not necessary for a man who thought turnips <lb/>
            made a delicious meal, and who used to boil them himself <lb/>
            while his wife baked the bread, to write so much about <lb/>
            how to save a penny, and how a man might most quickly <lb/>
            make a fortune. The great advantage of simplicity and <lb/>
            contentment is, that it prevents our wishing for super­ <lb/>
            fluities, or even thinking about them. Aristeides, when <lb/>
            cited as a witness during the trial of Kallias, is said to <lb/>
            have observed that those who were poor against their <lb/>
            will, ought to be ashamed of it, but that those who, like <lb/>
            himself, were poor from their own choice, gloried in <lb/>
            their poverty. It would be absurd to suppose that the <lb/>
            poverty of Aristeides was not voluntary, when, without <lb/>
            doing any criminal act, he might by stripping the body <lb/>
            of one dead Persian, or by plundering one tent, have made <lb/>
            himself a rich man. But enough of this.</p>
          <p>V. As to their campaigns, those of Cato added but <lb/>
            little to the already vast empire of Rome, while Aristeides <lb/>
            was present at Marathon, Salamis, and Platæa, the most <lb/>
            glorious of all Grecian victories. We cannot compare <lb/>
            Antiochus with Xerxes, nor the destruction of the walls of <lb/>
            the Spanish cities by Cato, with the tremendous slaughter <lb/>
            of the barbarians by the Greeks, both on sea and land. <lb/>
            Aristeides was present at every action of importance, <lb/>
            although he gave up his share of glory and rewards, even <lb/>
            as he did with gold and silver, to those who needed them <lb/>
            more than himself. I cannot blame Cato for always <lb/>
            glorifying himself and claiming the first place for himself, <lb/>
            although he says in one of his books that it is absurd for <lb/>
            a man either to praise or to blame himself; still I think <lb/>
            that he who does not even wish for the praises of others, <lb/>
            is a more perfect character than he who is always exalting <lb/>
            himself. An indifference to popular applause does much <lb/>
            to soften the bitterness of political controversy, while on <lb/>
            the other hand a love of distinction often leads men to be <lb/>
            ill-natured and spiteful to others, a fault which Aristeides <lb/>
            entirely avoided, and to which Cato was peculiarly liable. <lb/>
            Aristeides saved Athens by supporting the authority of <lb/>
            Themistokles on several critical occasions, and even acting <lb/>
            as his subordinate; while Cato by his opposition, nearly <lb/>
            ruined Scipio's famous expedition to Carthage, in which <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            he defeated the hitherto invincible Hannibal. Nor did <lb/>
            he cease his intrigues against Scipio until by calumnious <lb/>
            and false accusations he drove him out of Rome, and <lb/>
            stigmatized his brother with the disgraceful charge of <lb/>
            embezzling the public money.</p>
          <p>VI. Self-denial, upon which Cato has bestowed such <lb/>
            lavish praise, was practised in its purest and brightest <lb/>
            form by Aristeides, while Cato seems to have forfeited all <lb/>
            claim to this virtue by his unsuitable and unseasonable <lb/>
            second marriage. It could not be to his honour, when he <lb/>
            was of such a great age, to marry the daughter of his <lb/>
            own servant, a man who acted as a public clerk, and to <lb/>
            bring her into the house to act as mother-in-law to his son, <lb/>
            who was now himself grown up and married. Whether <lb/>
            he acted thus from natural inclination, or to spite his son <lb/>
            for his behaviour about his mistress, the marriage and <lb/>
            the motives which led to it are equally discreditable to <lb/>
            him. The sarcastic explanation of it which he gave to <lb/>
            his SOIl is utterly untrue; for had he wished to beget <lb/>
            other children as noble as his son, he ought to have married <lb/>
            a well-born lady at once, and not to have been satisfied <lb/>
            with a low intrigue until it was detected, and then to <lb/>
            have chosen as his father-in-law, the man whom he could <lb/>
            most easily influence, rather than some one whose alliance <lb/>
            would bring him honour and advantage.</p><pb n="134"/>

          <p>I. In the city of Mantinea there was a citizen named <lb/>
            Kleander, of one of the first families, and of great influence. <lb/>
            Nevertheless he was so unfortunate as to be forced to <lb/>
            leave his native city, and take refuge in Megalopolis, to <lb/>
            which he was chiefly attracted by Kraugis, the father <lb/>
            of Philopoemen, a man eminent in every respect, and <lb/>
            an especial private friend of Kleander. While Kraugis <lb/>
            lived, Kleander wanted for nothing, and after his death <lb/>
            endeavoured to repay the debt which he owed him by <lb/>
            devoting himself to the education of his orphan son, just <lb/>
            as Homer tells us that Achilles was nurtured by the exile <lb/>
            Phoenix. The child, who always was of a noble and <lb/>
            commanding spirit, grew under his care into a youth of <lb/>
            great promise. As he came near to manhood Ekdemus <lb/>
            and Megalophanes, two citizens of Megalopolis, took charge <lb/>
            of his education. These men had studied in the Academy <lb/>
            with Arkesilaus, and more than any others brought the <lb/>
            lessons of philosophy to bear upon politics and the daily <lb/>
            affairs of life. They freed their own country of the <lb/>
            despot Aristodemus by secretly contriving his assassination, <lb/>
            drove out the despot Nikokles from Sikyon, with the help <lb/>
            of Aratus, and, at the request of the people of Kyrene, <lb/>
            whose state was a prey to revolution, they went to that <lb/>
            country and restored order and respect for the laws. <lb/>
            They themselves, however, reckoned their most important <lb/>
            work to have been the education of Philopoemen, because <lb/>
            by bringing him up in the precepts of true philosophy <lb/>
            they made him a benefactor to all Greece. And truly <lb/>
            Greece loved him exceedingly, as the last great man born <lb/>
            of her old age, after so many great and famous men of <lb/>
            former times. A Roman speaking in his praise called <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            him the last of the Greeks, as though he thought tht.t <lb/>
            Greece had never after him produced any son worthy of <lb/>
            herself.</p>
          <p>II. His appearance was not repulsive, as some think ; <lb/>
            for we can see the statue of him which exists at Delphi <lb/>
            at this day. The mistake of his Megarian hostess seems <lb/>
            to have arisen from his good-nature and simplicity. She, <lb/>
            when she heard that the commander-in-chief of the <lb/>
            Achaeans was coming to her house, was in a great state of <lb/>
            excitement about the preparation of dinner, her husband <lb/>
            happening to be away. Meanwhile, Philopœmen entered, <lb/>
            dressed in a coarse cloak, and she, supposing him to be a <lb/>
            servant sent on in advance, ordered him to help her to get <lb/>
            things ready. He at once threw off his cloak and began <lb/>
            to split up firewood. While he was thus engaged his <lb/>
            friend the master of the house came in, and seeing him, <lb/>
            said, " What is this that you are doing, Philopœmen ?" <lb/>
            " Why," answered he in the Doric dialect, " I am suffering <lb/>
            for my ugly face." Titus, also, when jesting upon his <lb/>
            bodily shape, said, “ Philopoemen, what fine hands and legs <lb/>
            you have; but you have no belly," as indeed he had a <lb/>
            very small waist. However, the jest was directed more <lb/>
            against his power, for though he had plenty of good <lb/>
            infantry and cavalry he was frequently in great distress <lb/>
            for money to pay them. These are the common anecdotes <lb/>
            which are current about Philopoemen.</p>
          <p>III. His love of distinction was not entirely unmixed <lb/>
            with feelings of rivalry and passion. He desired to <lb/>
            emulate the fame of Epameinondas, but though he imitated <lb/>
            that great man in energy, good sense, and contempt <lb/>
            of money, yet he was unable in political struggles to <lb/>
            maintain his calm unruffled good-nature, but was often <lb/>
            betrayed by his fiery temper into sallies more befitting <lb/>
            a soldier than a statesman. Indeed, from a child he had <lb/>
            always been fond of war, and eagerly devoted himself to <lb/>
            soldier-like exercises, such as fighting in complete armour <lb/>
            and riding on horseback. He was thought to be a good <lb/>
            wrestler, and was invited by his friends to contend with <lb/>
            them in that sport, but he asked them whether the <lb/>
            practice would not impair his efficiency as a soldier, <lb/>
            when they answered truly that the body and the life of <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            an athlete differs from that of a soldier in every respect, <lb/>
            more particularly in diet and exercise. The athlete takes <lb/>
            long sleep, frequent meals, regular exercise and intervals <lb/>
            of rest, being likely to be put out of condition by the least <lb/>
            change of his accustomed routine, while the life of a <lb/>
            soldier makes him accustomed to all kinds of change and <lb/>
            diversity of life, especially to enduring hunger and want <lb/>
            of sleep. On learning this Philopœmen not only himself <lb/>
            avoided wrestling and ridiculed it, but when he was in <lb/>
            command of an army took every means in his power to <lb/>
            bring every kind of athletic exercise into contempt, as <lb/>
            likely to unfit the best men'is bodies for the most important <lb/>
            struggles in battle.</p>
          <p>IV. On leaving his schoolmasters he took part in the <lb/>
            incursion made by his fellow citizens into the Laconian <lb/>
            territory for the purpose of plunder. In these raids it <lb/>
            was his wont always to be first in the attack, and last in <lb/>
            the retreat. In time of peace he would exercise his body, <lb/>
            and make it both swift and strong, either by hunting or <lb/>
            by tilling the ground. He possessed a fine estate about <lb/>
            twenty furlongs from the city: to this he would walk after <lb/>
            his morning or evening meal, and sleep there on any bed <lb/>
            he could find, like one of the farm labourers. Then he <lb/>
            would rise early, help the vine-dressers or cattle-herds to <lb/>
            do their work, and, returning to town, take part in public <lb/>
            business. The profits arising from the plunder gained in <lb/>
            the forays he used to spend on horses, arms, and the <lb/>
            redeeming of captives, while he endeavoured to increase <lb/>
            his income by the skilful cultivation of his farm, con­ <lb/>
            sidering the most just way of making money, and his <lb/>
            strict duty to be, so to manage his fortune as to avoid <lb/>
            the temptation of wronging others. He used to listen to <lb/>
            conversation and to read treatises upon philosophy, yet not <lb/>
            all, but only those which he thought would teach him to <lb/>
            be virtuous. He also devoted much time to reading those <lb/>
            passages of Homer which stir up and excite manly courage. <lb/>
            His other reading consisted chiefly of Evangelus's <lb/>
            treatise on military tactics, and of the history of Alexander <lb/>
            the Great; but he always thought that reading, unless <lb/>
            it led to action, was a useless waste of time. In his studies <lb/>
            of tactics he used to disregard the diagrams in the boon. <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            and consider what could be done in the field itself, observ­ <lb/>
            ing the slopes and inequalities of the ground, the direction <lb/>
            of brooks and water-courses, and the effect which they <lb/>
            would have upon a body of troops advancing in line or in <lb/>
            column. These reflections he was wont to make during <lb/>
            his walks, and to exercise the minds of his companions by <lb/>
            questions about them; for he devoted his whole mind to <lb/>
            the study of military matters, regarding war as the widest <lb/>
            arena for the display of virtue, utterly despising those <lb/>
            who were not soldiers, as useless members of society.</p>
          <p>V. When he was thirty years old Kleomenes, the king <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians, made a night attack upon Mega­ <lb/>
            lopolis, forced his way through the guard on the wall <lb/>
            and reached the market-place. Philopœmen came to the <lb/>
            rescue, but was not able to dislodge the enemy, although <lb/>
            he assaulted them with the greatest spirit. However, he <lb/>
            gained time for the citizens to leave the town, while he <lb/>
            bore the whole brunt of the attack of Kleomenes, so that <lb/>
            at last he had great difficulty in extricating himself, as <lb/>
            he had lost his horse and was wounded. The citizens of <lb/>
            Megalopolis escaped to Messene, whither Kleomenes sent <lb/>
            to offer them their town and territory again. Philopœmen, <lb/>
            when he saw his fellow-citizens eager to embrace this <lb/>
            offer, restrained them from accepting it by pointing out <lb/>
            that Kleomenes did not really offer them their city back <lb/>
            again, but meant to get the citizens as well into his power, <lb/>
            in order to be able to hold it more securely for the future; <lb/>
            because he could not remain there guarding naked walls <lb/>
            and empty houses, but would be compelled to leave them <lb/>
            and go his way. By these arguments he withheld the <lb/>
            Megalopolitans from coming to terms, but gave Kleomenes <lb/>
            a pretext for destroying a great part of the city, and <lb/>
            carrying away a great booty from it.</p>
          <p>VI. When King Antigonus some time after this joined <lb/>
            the Achaean forces in a campaign against Kleomenes, they <lb/>
            came upon his army advantageously posted so as to <lb/>
            command the defiles near Sellasia. Philopœmen was <lb/>
            among the cavalry that day with his fellow-citizens, and <lb/>
            next to him were posted the Illyrians, numerous and war­ <lb/>
            like, who covered the flank of the allies. Their orders were <lb/>
            to remain in reserve until they saw a red flag raised upon a <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            pike by king Antigonus on the other wing. The generals <lb/>
            of the allies attacked the Lacedæmonians with the Illyrian <lb/>
            troops, but Eukleides, the brother of Kleomenes, perceiving <lb/>
            that by this movement the foot were completely severed <lb/>
            from the horse, sent the swiftest of his light-armed troops <lb/>
            to outflank them and cut them off. When this was <lb/>
            done, and the Illyrians were thrown into great disorder, <lb/>
            Philopcemen saw that the cavalry could charge the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian light troops with great effect, and pointed this <lb/>
            out to Antigonus's generals. Meeting with a scornful <lb/>
            refusal, as his reputation was not yet sufficiently great to <lb/>
            warrant his suggesting such a manoeuvre, he collected his <lb/>
            own fellow-countrymen and charged with them alone. At <lb/>
            the first onset he threw the light-armed troops into con­ <lb/>
            fusion, and presently routed them with great slaughter. <lb/>
            Wishing to encourage the allies and to come more quickly <lb/>
            to blows with the retreating enemy, he dismounted, and <lb/>
            with great difficulty, encumbered by his heavy horseman's <lb/>
            cuirass and accoutrements, pursued over a rough piece of <lb/>
            ground full of water-courses and precipitous rocks. While <lb/>
            struggling over these obstacles he was struck through both <lb/>
            thighs by a javelin with a.- strap attached to it, a wound <lb/>
            which was not dangerous, though the javelin struck him <lb/>
            with such force as to drive the iron head quite through. <lb/>
            This wound for the time rendered him helpless, as it <lb/>
            bound both his legs as if with a chain, while the strap made <lb/>
            it hard to pull the javelin out again through the wound. <lb/>
            As his friends hesitated, not knowing what to do, while <lb/>
            the battle now at its height, excited his courage, and made <lb/>
            him long to take part in it, he violently strained one leg <lb/>
            forward and the other back, so as to break the javelin in <lb/>
            the middle, after which the pieces were pulled out. Being <lb/>
            thus set free, he drew his sword, ran through the first of <lb/>
            the combatants and attacked the enemy, animating all his <lb/>
            men and setting them on fire with emulation. After the <lb/>
            victory was won Antigonus enquired of the Macedonians <lb/>
            why the cavalry had charged without orders. They <lb/>
            answered that they were forced to charge against their <lb/>
            will by a young citizen of Megalopolis, who attacked on <lb/>
            his own account. Antigonus smiled, and answered, “ That <lb/>
            young man acted like a veteran commander."</p><pb n="139"/>
            
          <p>VII. Philopoemen, as may be supposed, gamed great <lb/>
            glory by this action. Antigonus was eager to obtain his <lb/>
            services, and offered him a command and high pay, but <lb/>
            he excused himself, knowing that his temper would not <lb/>
            endure to be under the orders of another man. Still, as <lb/>
            he could not be idle, he sailed for Crete to serve a cam­ <lb/>
            paign there, in order to gain experience of war. He <lb/>
            spent a considerable time there, living amongst warlike, <lb/>
            sober, and temperate men, and returned to the Achaeans <lb/>
            with so great a reputation that they at once put him in <lb/>
            command of the knights. These horsemen, he found, were <lb/>
            in the habit of using any chance horses they could pick <lb/>
            up when required for a campaign, while in many cases <lb/>
            they did not serve in person, but sent substitutes. They <lb/>
            were entirely without discipline or bravery, while all <lb/>
            this was passed over unnoticed by their commanders, <lb/>
            because the knights were the most influential men <lb/>
            among the Achæans, and were able to promote or degrade <lb/>
            whom they pleased. Philopoemen, however, could not <lb/>
            allow this state of things to continue. He went round to <lb/>
            each of the cities of the Achaean League, and by personally <lb/>
            appealing to the young men's sense of honour, by punish­ <lb/>
            ment where it was necessary, and by careful training, <lb/>
            exercises, and contests among them before as many spec­ <lb/>
            tatoris as possible, in a short time produced great efficiency <lb/>
            and military spirit. He made them quick at manoeuvring <lb/>
            in squadrons, and in wheeling round and managing their <lb/>
            horses, which is so valuable a quality in cavalry soldiers, <lb/>
            and taught the whole body to move with ease at the will <lb/>
            of one man. Once during a severe battle with the Eleans <lb/>
            and Ætolians on the banks of the river Larissa, Damo­ <lb/>
            phantus, the commander of the Elean horse, rode furiously <lb/>
            to attack Philopœmen. He awaited Damophantus's onset, <lb/>
            and with his spear thrust him from his saddle. When <lb/>
            he fell the Eleans at once turned and fled, to the great <lb/>
            glory of Philopœmen, who had proved himself as brave <lb/>
            as the youngest and as skilful as the oldest soldier, equally <lb/>
            able to fight or to command.</p>
          <p>VIII. The Achæan League was first organised by <lb/>
            Aratus, who formed its scattered and despicable cities <lb/>
            into a noble and truly Greek commonwealth; then, as in <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            running streams, when first a few small stones resist the <lb/>
            flow of the water, soon much more is brought down by <lb/>
            the stream and lodged against them until a firm ground <lb/>
            is formed ; so did the Achæans, by assisting some of the <lb/>
            neighbouring cities and freeing them from despots, and <lb/>
            by uniting and incorporating others with themselves, <lb/>
            endeavour to combine the whole of Peloponnesus into one <lb/>
            single state, at a time when Greece was especially weak, <lb/>
            having lost all cohesion, each city relying solely on itself. <lb/>
            While Aratus lived they depended much on the Macedo­ <lb/>
            nians, courting first Ptolemy, then Antigonus and Philip, <lb/>
            who all were constantly interfering in the affairs of <lb/>
            Greece. But when Philopoemen came to command they <lb/>
            already felt themselves a match for the most powerful <lb/>
            states, and no longer paid their court to foreign patrons. <lb/>
            Aratus, who was no soldier, had effected most of his <lb/>
            successes by suave diplomacy and personal friendship <lb/>
            with foreign princes, as we have written in his Life : but <lb/>
            Philopoemen, a brave and vigorous, and, what is more, <lb/>
            an eminently successful commander in his first essays, <lb/>
            greatly raised the spirit and the strength of the Achæans, <lb/>
            by making them confident of victory under his leadership.</p>
          <p>IX. His first task was to alter the military equipment <lb/>
            and arms of the Achæans. They had hitherto used light <lb/>
            shields, too narrow to protect the body, and spears much <lb/>
            smaller than the long Macedonian pike. This light <lb/>
            armament rendered them effective as skirmishers, but <lb/>
            unable to hold their own in close fighting. Their order <lb/>
            of battle, too, was loose and without cohesion, having <lb/>
            neither the projecting pikes nor the serried shields of the <lb/>
            Macedonian phalanx, in consequence of which they were <lb/>
            easily thrust aside and routed. Philopœmen pointed this <lb/>
            out to them, and persuaded them to adopt the heavy <lb/>
            shield and pike in place of their light arms, to accoutre <lb/>
            themselves with helmet, corslet, and greaves, and to <lb/>
            endeavour to move in a steady unbroken mass instead of <lb/>
            in a loose irregular skirmishing order. When he had <lb/>
            induced them to put on complete armour he raised their <lb/>
            spirit by telling them that they would be unconquer­ <lb/>
            able, while he also effected a most wholesome change in <lb/>
            their luxurious habits of life. It was impossible entirely <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            to do away with their long-standing passion for fine <lb/>
            purple robes and tapestry, rich banquets, and furniture: <lb/>
            but he directed this love of finery to useful purposes, and <lb/>
            soon brought them all to retrench their private expenditure, <lb/>
            and to take a pride in the splendour of their military equip­ <lb/>
            ments. Their plate was sent to the crucible, and employed <lb/>
            to gild corslets, shields, and caparisons; their public <lb/>
            places were full of young men training chargers or exer­ <lb/>
            cising themselves in arms, while the women were busy <lb/>
            fitting plumes to helmets, and ornamenting buff coats and <lb/>
            military cloaks. The sight of all this activity roused up <lb/>
            their courage, and made them eager for battle. In all <lb/>
            other cases too much care for outward show and display <lb/>
            leads to effeminacy and luxury, because the pleasure which <lb/>
            our senses receive from these things blunt our better <lb/>
            judgment, but in military matters this is not so, for a <lb/>
            splendid appearance under arms increases men's courage ; <lb/>
            as Homer tells us that Achilles, when his new arms were <lb/>
            brought to him, was at once excited by a vehement desire <lb/>
            to make use of them. The youth, thus equipped, were in­ <lb/>
            cessantly exercised and practised in their new manoeuvres, <lb/>
            which they performed with zealous goodwill, being de­ <lb/>
            lighted with the close formation of the phalanx, which <lb/>
            seemed as though it could never be broken. They soon <lb/>
            began to move with ease in their heavy armour, priding <lb/>
            themselves upon its splendour, and longing to prove its <lb/>
            value in battle against their enemies. The Achaeans at <lb/>
            this time were at war with Machanidas the despot of <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, who had immense resources at his disposal, <lb/>
            and menaced the whole of Peloponnesus. As soon as news <lb/>
            came that he had invaded Arcadia and had reached <lb/>
            Mantinea, Philopœmen with his army marched rapidly to <lb/>
            attack him. Both sides drew up their forces near the city <lb/>
            of Mantinea, and both brought into the field not only <lb/>
            nearly nil their own countrymen, but also large bodies of <lb/>
            foreign mercenary troops. Machanidas began the battle <lb/>
            by a charge of his mercenaries, who routed the Tarentines <lb/>
            and other light troops of the Achaeans, but then instead <lb/>
            of moving at once to attack and overwhelm their main <lb/>
            body, hurried away in pursuit, leaving the Achæan phalanx <lb/>
            standing untouched. Philopoemen made light of the <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            disaster which had happened to the light troops, and, <lb/>
            perceiving the fault which the enemy had committed in <lb/>
            leaving their heavy infantry unprotected, so that he had <lb/>
            an open plain over which to march against them, disre­ <lb/>
            garded those Lacedæmonians who were pursuing his own <lb/>
            auxiliaries, and bore straight down upon their main body, <lb/>
            which he took in flank, without any cavalry to protect it, <lb/>
            or any general to give it orders, as the men did not expect <lb/>
            to be attacked, and imagined that the victory was already <lb/>
            won when they saw Machanidas so eager in the pursuit. <lb/>
            Philopœmen broke and routed them with great slaughter, <lb/>
            four thousand men being said to have perished, and then <lb/>
            turned to encounter Machanidas, who was returning with <lb/>
            his mercenaries, and found his retreat cut off. A deep <lb/>
            and wide watercourse here divided the two leaders, the <lb/>
            one of whom endeavoured to pass it and escape, while the <lb/>
            other tried to prevent this. They looked no longer like <lb/>
            two generals, but the despot seemed more like some savage <lb/>
            beast driven to bay by Philopœmen, that mighty hunter. <lb/>
            At length the despot spurred his horse, a fiery animal, to <lb/>
            attempt the leap. The horse gained the other bank with <lb/>
            its fore feet, and was struggling up it, when Simias and <lb/>
            Polyænus, the constant companions and aides-de-camp of <lb/>
            Philopœmen, rode to attack him with levelled lances. <lb/>
            Philopoemen, however, came up with Machanidas before <lb/>
            them. Seeing that the despot's horse was rearing its <lb/>
            head so as to protect its master's body, he turned his own <lb/>
            horse a little to one side, and, seizing his lance firmly <lb/>
            with both hands, drove it through his body and cast him <lb/>
            from his horse. It is in this posture that Philopœmen <lb/>
            is represented in the statue at Delphi, which was placed <lb/>
            there by the Achaeans in token of their admiration of his <lb/>
            courage and conduct on that day.</p>
          <p>XI. It is said that when the Greeks were assembled at <lb/>
            the Nemean Games, Philopoemen, who had been elected <lb/>
            commander-in-chief for the second time, and not long <lb/>
            before had won his victory at Mantinea, being at leisure <lb/>
            during the festival displayed his phalanx to the Greeks, <lb/>
            with the troops drawn up in their serried array, and man­ <lb/>
            œuvring with quickness and precision. Afterwards, while <lb/>
            the musicians were contending for the prize in the theatre <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            he entered it accompanied by his young soldiers in their <lb/>
            military cloaks and purple uniform, all of them strong <lb/>
            men in the prime of life, showing a modest respect for <lb/>
            their general, combined with a martial bearing due to <lb/>
            their many brave feats of arms. Just as they came into <lb/>
            the theatre Pylades the musician began to recite tho <lb/>
            ‘ Persians' of Timotheus <lb/>
            “ He wrought for Greece a noble work of freedom " <lb/>
            in a loud voice and with suitable solemnity. At this, all <lb/>
            the spectators turned their eyes upon Philopoemen and <lb/>
            broke into joyous applause, remembering the ancient <lb/>
            glories of Greece, and feeling such confidence in him as <lb/>
            almost to recover the ancient spirit of their nation.</p>
          <p>XII. But just as horses like their accustomed rider, and <lb/>
            if another mounts them are scared and unmanageable, <lb/>
            so the power of the Achæans become feeble under any <lb/>
            other general than Philopoemen. When they saw him, the <lb/>
            whole army rejoiced, and were filled with cheerful con­ <lb/>
            fidence, well knowing that he was the only one of then <lb/>
            generals before whom the enemy always fled, terrified by <lb/>
            his name, as, indeed, appeared by their acts. For Philip <lb/>
            king of Macedon, thinking that if Philopœmen were put <lb/>
            out of the way, the Achaeans would become subject to <lb/>
            himself as they were before, sent men privately to Argos <lb/>
            to assassinate him: but his plot was disclosed, and he be­ <lb/>
            came an object of universal hatred to the Greeks. The <lb/>
            Boeotians too, when they were besieging Megara and were <lb/>
            expecting shortly to take it, retreated in such hot haste <lb/>
            that they actually left their scaling ladders planted <lb/>
            against the walls, in consequence of a rumour, which <lb/>
            proved a false one, that Philopœmen was coming to raise <lb/>
            the siege and was close at hand. When Nabis, who <lb/>
            became despot over the Lacedæmonians after Machanidas, <lb/>
            by a sudden attack captured the town of Messene, Philo­ <lb/>
            pœmen was not holding any office, but was a mere private <lb/>
            citizen. He could not prevail upon Lysippus, who was <lb/>
            commander-in-chief of the Achæans, to go to assist the <lb/>
            Messenians, because the latter said that the city must be <lb/>
            lost if the enemy were inside the walls. Hereupon Philo­ <lb/>
            pœmen went himself to the rescue with the men of his <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            own city, who did not delay for any formal vote to empower <lb/>
            him to do so, but followed him because he was born to <lb/>
            command. When Nabis heard of his approach he would <lb/>
            not await his coming, but although he was in possession <lb/>
            of the city he marched out by the opposite gate with all <lb/>
            speed, thinking that he would be fortunate if he reached <lb/>
            home safe, as indeed he did. Thus was Messene delivered.</p>
          <p>XIII. All these exploits of Philopœmen are without <lb/>
            doubt glorious to him; but he was much blamed for going <lb/>
            a second time to Crete at the request of the people of <lb/>
            Gortyna, to act as their general, leaving his own country <lb/>
            to be attacked by Nabis, because he avoided the war <lb/>
            at home to gather unseasonable laurels abroad. Indeed, <lb/>
            the citizens of Megalopolis were so hard pressed at that <lb/>
            period as to be forced to live entirely within their walls, <lb/>
            and grow corn in the very streets, as they were quite cut <lb/>
            off from their fields by the enemy, who was encamped <lb/>
            before the gates. Philopœmen, by his remaining beyond <lb/>
            seas at this time acting as general for the Cretans, gave <lb/>
            his enemies an opportunity of charging him with dis­ <lb/>
            honourably shirking the war at home. Some, however, <lb/>
            said that since the Achæans had chosen other men generals, <lb/>
            Philopoemen, who had no office to fill, had a right to use <lb/>
            his leisure in acting as general to the people of Gortyna <lb/>
            when they begged him to do so. Indeed, his nature <lb/>
            abhorred rest, and he desired his courage and generalship <lb/>
            to be in constant action, like everything else belonging to <lb/>
            him. This is clearly shown by his saying about king <lb/>
            Ptolemy. When some one praised that prince for carefully <lb/>
            training his army and exercising himself under arms <lb/>
            every day, Philopœmen answered, “ Who can admire a <lb/>
            king of Ptolemy's age who is still practising and not per­ <lb/>
            forming." However, the citizens of Megalopolis were <lb/>
            much vexed by his conduct, which they, considered to be <lb/>
            that of a traitor, and would have banished him had they <lb/>
            not been restrained by the whole body of the Achæans. <lb/>
            They sent the general Aristænetus to Megalopolis, who, <lb/>
            although he was politically opposed to Philopœmen, <lb/>
            would not allow sentence of banishment to be passed <lb/>
            against him. After this Philopœmen, being treated with <lb/>
            neglect and indifference by his fellow-citizens, induced <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            many of the outlying villages to rebel against the city, <lb/>
            telling them to say that they were not originally made <lb/>
            subject to it, and he himself openly took their part against <lb/>
            his own city when the matter was referred to the general <lb/>
            council of the Achæan league. But these things happened <lb/>
            afterwards. At the time of which we speak he carried on <lb/>
            war in Crete with the Gortynians, not in a simple straight­ <lb/>
            forward manner, as one would expect a Peloponnesian, and <lb/>
            especially an Arcadian would do, but he adopted the <lb/>
            Cretan character, and by using all their subtle devices <lb/>
            and ambushes against themselves, proved that such con­ <lb/>
            trivances are but child's play when tried against a truly <lb/>
            experienced general.</p>
          <p>XIV. Returning to Peloponnesus with a great reputation <lb/>
            from his Cretan successes, he found Philip beaten by Titus <lb/>
            Quintius, and Nabis at war both with the Romans and the <lb/>
            Achæans. He was at once elected general to attack Nabis, <lb/>
            and in a sea fight suffered the same misfortune as Epa­ <lb/>
            meinondas, that is to say, he effected much less at sea than <lb/>
            was expected of a man of his courage and reputation.</p>
          <p>Indeed some writers tell us that Epameinondas was un­ <lb/>
            willing that his countrymen should taste the advantages <lb/>
            of the sea, and fearing that, as Plato says, they might from <lb/>
            steady soldiers be transformed into licentious wandering <lb/>
            sailors, purposely returned from the coast of Asia Minor <lb/>
            and the islands without having effected anything.</p>
          <p>Philopcemen, imagining that his knowledge of war on <lb/>
            land would enable him to fight equally well at sea, learned <lb/>
            by experience how greatly practice assists men's courage, <lb/>
            and how much their strength is increased by being trained <lb/>
            to use it. Not only was he worsted in a sea-fight through <lb/>
            inexperience, but having selected an old ship, which had <lb/>
            once been a famous vessel, but now was forty years old, <lb/>
            she leaked so much as to endanger the lives of those on <lb/>
            board. After the action, finding that the enemy despised <lb/>
            him, as though his ships had been entirely driven from <lb/>
            the sea, and that they were ostentatiously besieging <lb/>
            Gythium, he sailed straightway thither and found them <lb/>
            quite unprepared, and with their discipline relaxed in <lb/>
            consequence of their victory. He landed his men at night, <lb/>
            burned the enemy's tents, and slew many of them. A few <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            days afterwards, being surprised by Nabis in a mountainous <lb/>
            spot, while all the Achæans gave themselves up for lost, <lb/>
            despairing of extricating themselves from such a difficult <lb/>
            pt sition, Philopoemen, after a short survey of the country, <lb/>
            proved that strategy is the greatest of military qualities. <lb/>
            He quietly and steadily changed his front, manoeuvred <lb/>
            his army out of its disadvantageous position, attacked the <lb/>
            enemy, and completely routed them. Perceiving that the <lb/>
            fugitives did not make for the city, but scattered them­ <lb/>
            selves all over the country, which was hilly and wooded, <lb/>
            full of torrents and precipices, and impassable for cavalry, <lb/>
            he made no pursuit, but encamped before dark. As he <lb/>
            conjectured that the enemy after their rout would straggle <lb/>
            back into the city by twos and threes under cover of the <lb/>
            darkness, he concealed many of the Achæans, armed with <lb/>
            daggers, in the rough ground near the city. By this <lb/>
            stratagem Nabis's force suffered great losses, for as they <lb/>
            did not retreat in a body, but each man as best he could, <lb/>
            they fell into their foemen's hands at the city gate like <lb/>
            birds into a snare.</p>
          <p>XV. Philopœmen gained so much glory by these exploits, <lb/>
            and was so much honoured by the Greeks wherever he ap­ <lb/>
            peared in public, that he roused the jealousy of Flamininus, <lb/>
            who thought that he, a consul of Rome, was worthier of <lb/>
            respect than a mere Arcadian, while he had moreover done <lb/>
            much more for Greece, having by one proclamation restored <lb/>
            those liberties of which Philip and his Macedonians had <lb/>
            deprived it. Flamininus put an end to the war with <lb/>
            Nabis, who was shortly afterwards assassinated by the <lb/>
            Ætolians. As this event threw Sparta into disorder, <lb/>
            Philopœmen seized the opportunity, marched thither with <lb/>
            an army, and partly by persuasion, partly by force, pre­ <lb/>
            vailed upon the city to join the Achaean league. This <lb/>
            wonderfully raised his fame throughout Greece, that he <lb/>
            should have won over so famous and powerful a oily, for <lb/>
            Sparta formed a most important member of the league. <lb/>
            He also gained the good will of the Lacedæmonian nobles, <lb/>
            who hoped that he would protect their newly-won liberty. <lb/>
            They sold the house and property of Nabis, and decreed <lb/>
            that the money, amounting to a hundred and twenty talents, <lb/>
            should be presented to him by a deputation. On this <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            occasion Philopoemen showed himself to he a man of real <lb/>
            virtue. At the interview none of the Spartans liked to <lb/>
            propose to him to receive the money, but they excused <lb/>
            themselves, and made his own especial friend Timolaus <lb/>
            undertake to do this. Timolaus, however, when he reached <lb/>
            Megalopolis, and living in the house of Philopœmen had <lb/>
            an opportunity of observing the noble simplicity of his <lb/>
            character and his lofty integrity, in the familiar inter­ <lb/>
            course of private life, dared not mention the bribe, but <lb/>
            gave some other excuse for his visit and returned home. <lb/>
            He was sent a second time, with the same result. On a <lb/>
            third visit he with great hesitation broached the subject. <lb/>
            Philopœmen listened to him without anger, and sent him <lb/>
            back to the Spartans with the advice that they should not <lb/>
            corrupt their friends, whose services they could obtain <lb/>
            gratis, but keep their money to bribe those who en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to countermine their city in the public assembly <lb/>
            of the Achæan league, as, if muzzled in this way, they <lb/>
            would cease to oppose them. It was better, he added, to <lb/>
            restrain the freedom of speech of their enemies than that <lb/>
            of their friends. So uncorrupt was he, and inaccessible to <lb/>
            bribes.</p>
          <p>XVI. When Diophanes, the commander-in-chief of the <lb/>
            Achæans, endeavoured to punish the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            for a change in their policy, and they by their resist­ <lb/>
            ance threw the whole of Peloponnesus into confusion, <lb/>
            Philopœmen tried to act as mediator, and to soothe the <lb/>
            anger of Diophanes, pointing out to him that at a time <lb/>
            when the Romans and king Antiochus with enormous <lb/>
            forces were about to make Greece their battle ground, a <lb/>
            general ought to direct all his thoughts to their movements, <lb/>
            and to avoid any internal disturbance, willingly accepting <lb/>
            any apologies from those who did wrong. But as Diophanes <lb/>
            took no notice of him, but together with Flamininus <lb/>
            invaded Laconia, Philopoemen, disregarding the exact letter <lb/>
            of the law, performed a most spirited and noble action. He <lb/>
            hurried to Sparta, and, though only a private man, shut <lb/>
            its gates in the faces of the commander-in-chief of the <lb/>
            Achæans and of the Roman consul, put an end to. the <lb/>
            revolutionary movement there, and prevailed upon the <lb/>
            city to rejoin the Achæan league. Some time afterwards <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            however, we are told by Polybius that Philopœme , when <lb/>
            commander-in-chief, having some quarrel with tlo Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, restored the exiles to the city, and put to <lb/>
            death eighty, or, according to Aristokrates, three hundred <lb/>
            and fifty Spartans. He also pulled down the walls of Sparta, <lb/>
            and annexed a large portion of its territory to Megalopolis, <lb/>
            while he forced all those persons who had been created <lb/>
            citizens of Sparta under the rule of the despots to leave <lb/>
            the city and proceed to Achæa, except three hundred. <lb/>
            These, because they refused to obey him and leave <lb/>
            Lacedæmon he sold for slaves, and with the money, as a <lb/>
            wanton insult, built a public portico in Megalopolis. <lb/>
            Moreover, in his wrath against the Lacedæmonians, he did <lb/>
            them a most cruel wrong, for he abolished the Lycurgean <lb/>
            system of education and forced them to educate their <lb/>
            children like those of the Achæans, because he saw that <lb/>
            they never would be humble-minded as long as they lived <lb/>
            under the disipline of Lycurgus. Thus was the haughty <lb/>
            city of Sparta brought so low by its misfortunes as to <lb/>
            permit Philopœmen to cut, as it were, its very sinews, and <lb/>
            render it tame and crushed, Afterwards, however, the <lb/>
            citizens obtained permission from Rome to retire from the <lb/>
            Achæan confederation, upon which they restored their <lb/>
            original constitution as far as their great disasters per­ <lb/>
            mitted.</p>
          <p>XVII. When the Romans were fighting king Antiochus <lb/>
            in Greece, Philopœmen was in a private station, but, seeing <lb/>
            Antiochus lying idly at Chalkis, wasting his time in <lb/>
            unseasonable courtships and weddings, while his Syrian <lb/>
            troops, in great disorder and without officers to control <lb/>
            them, were scattered through the various Greek cities, <lb/>
            living in riotous debauchery, he was vexed at not being <lb/>
            elected commander in chief, and said that he envied the <lb/>
            Romans their victory. " I," said he, " if I had been in com­ <lb/>
            mand, would have cut off the whole of Antiochus's army <lb/>
            in the taverns."</p>
          <p>After the defeat of Antiochus the Romans began to <lb/>
            tighten their hold upon Greece, and to absorb the Achæan <lb/>
            league. Many of the popular leaders took their side, and <lb/>
            the growing power of Rome was fated by the divine bless­ <lb/>
            ing before long to become absolute in Greece. Philopœ­ <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            men, like a skilful pilot, struggling against a rough sea, <lb/>
            was often compelled to yield and give way for a time, yet <lb/>
            as he was utterly opposed to the Romans he did his best <lb/>
            to induce the most influential men to defend the liberties <lb/>
            of Greece. Aristænetus of Megapolis, a man of great <lb/>
            influence with the Achæans, who urged them in the public <lb/>
            assembly not to oppose or to thwart the Romans in any­ <lb/>
            thing, was listened to by Philopœmen for some time in <lb/>
            silence, until at length he was moved to exclaim, "My <lb/>
            good sir, why be in such a hurry to behold the end of <lb/>
            Greece?" When Manius the Roman consul had conquered <lb/>
            Antiochus, he begged the Achaeans to permit the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonian exiles to return. Titus Flamininus seconded <lb/>
            this request, but Philopœmen opposed it; not because he <lb/>
            had any quarrel with the exiles, but because he wished <lb/>
            their restoration to be effected by himself and the Achaeans, <lb/>
            of their own free will, not as a favour to Flamininus and <lb/>
            the Romans. Afterwards, when commander-in-chief, he <lb/>
            himself restored them. Thus did his high spirit make <lb/>
            him impatient of control and authority.</p>
          <p>XVIII. When he was in his seventieth year, and <lb/>
            eighth term of office as commander-in-chief, he might <lb/>
            reasonably expect to finish not only his year of office, but <lb/>
            also the rest of his life in peace; for just as in human <lb/>
            bodies as their strength wastes away the violence of their <lb/>
            diseases abates, so in the Greek states as their power failed <lb/>
            their quarrels gradually ceased. However some Nemesis <lb/>
            overtook hint, as it does a too successful athlete just at the <lb/>
            termination of his course. It is said that when some persons <lb/>
            in society were praising a man who was thought to be a <lb/>
            good general, Philopœmen said, " How can you think <lb/>
            that man worth consideration, who was taken by his enemy <lb/>
            alive."</p>
          <p>A few days after this Deinokrates of Messene, a personal <lb/>
            enemy of Philopœmen, and one who was generally dis­ <lb/>
            liked because of his wicked and licentious life, caused <lb/>
            Meesene to revolt from the Achæan league, and was <lb/>
            announced to be marching upon a village named Kolonis. <lb/>
            Thilopœmen was at this time lying ill with a fever in the <lb/>
            city of Argos, but on hearing this he proceeded at once <lb/>
            to Megalopolis, a distance of four hundred furlongs, in one <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            day. From that city he set out straightway with a <lb/>
            body of cavalry, composed of the noblest citizens, but <lb/>
            mostly very young men, who were proud to serve as <lb/>
            volunteers under Philopoemen. They rode into the <lb/>
            Messenian territory, met Deinokrates near the hill of <lb/>
            Evander, and put him to flight. However as the <lb/>
            Messenian frontier patrol of five hundred men suddenly <lb/>
            came up, the defeated body rallied again, and Philopœmen, <lb/>
            fearing to be surrounded, and wishing to be careful of the <lb/>
            lives of his men, retired into mountainous ground, himself <lb/>
            protecting the rear, making frequent charges, and drawing <lb/>
            the whole attack of the enemy upon himself. They did <lb/>
            not dare to encounter him personally, but clamoured and <lb/>
            wheeled about at a distance. In his eagerness to save each <lb/>
            one of his young soldiers he ventured forward so often, to <lb/>
            cover their retreat, that at last he found himself alone in <lb/>
            the midst of his enemies. None of them dared to meet <lb/>
            him, but pelted him with stones and darts from a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, so that lie was with difficulty able to guide his <lb/>
            horse over the rocky and precipitous ground, and fatigued <lb/>
            the animal greatly.</p>
          <p>His age was no hindrance to him, because of his habit <lb/>
            of constant exercise, but unluckily he was weak from his <lb/>
            sickness, and wearied by his long journey, so as to feel <lb/>
            faint. His horse at length stumbling threw him to the <lb/>
            ground. He fell heavily on his head, and lay speechless <lb/>
            for some time, so that his enemies thought that he was <lb/>
            dead, and began to turn over his body and strip it. But <lb/>
            when he raised his head and opened his eyes they fell <lb/>
            upon him in a body, tied his hands behind his back, and <lb/>
            led him away, jeering much at a man who never even <lb/>
            dreamed that he could have been so triumphed over by <lb/>
            Deinokrates.</p>
          <p>XIX. The Messenians who were in the city, greatly <lb/>
            excited at the news, assembled at the gates. When they <lb/>
            saw Philopœmen dragged along and treated in a manner <lb/>
            so unworthy of a man who had gained such glorious <lb/>
            victories, most of them felt compassion for him, and were <lb/>
            moved to tears as they reflected how uncertain a thing is <lb/>
            human power. Thus gradually they expressed aloud <lb/>
            their kindly feeling towards him, saying that his former <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            benefits and the liberty which he bestowed upon them by <lb/>
            driving out the despot Nabis, ought to be had in remem­ <lb/>
            brance. There were some few, however, who in order to <lb/>
            gain favour with Deinokrates, advised him to put Philo­ <lb/>
            poemen to death by torture, pointing out that he was a <lb/>
            dangerous enemy, and would be peculiarly exasperated <lb/>
            against Deinokrates if he now were to regain his freedom <lb/>
            after having been his captive and having been insulted <lb/>
            by him. Finally they put him into what was called the <lb/>
            Treasury, a subterranean chamber with no window or <lb/>
            communication with the outward air, and no door even, <lb/>
            but closed by a great stone. There they left him, putting <lb/>
            the great stone over the entrance, and placing a guard of <lb/>
            armed men round it.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the Achæan horsemen rallied from their <lb/>
            flight, and as Philopœmen was nowhere to be seen, they <lb/>
            thought that he must have fallen, They remained for a <lb/>
            long while, searching for him, and reproaching themselves <lb/>
            with having obtained dishonourable safety by abandoning <lb/>
            to the enemy their leader, who had laid down his life for <lb/>
            them. Afterwards they pushed forward, inquiring every­ <lb/>
            where for him, and at length learned that he had been <lb/>
            captured. They at once sent the news to the various cities <lb/>
            of the Achæan league, who took the matter greatly to <lb/>
            heart, determined to demand Philopœmen publicly from <lb/>
            the Messenians, and prepared for a campaign on his <lb/>
            behalf.</p>
          <p>XX. While they were acting thus, Deinokrates feared <lb/>
            that delay might save Philopoemen's life. Wishing there­ <lb/>
            fore to be beforehand with the Achaeans, as soon as night <lb/>
            came on, and the greater part of the Messenians had retired, <lb/>
            he opened the prison and sent into it a public slave with a <lb/>
            draught of poison, ordering him to stand by Philopœmen <lb/>
            until he had drunk it. Philopœmen was lying down <lb/>
            wrapped in his cloak, not asleep, but full of trouble and <lb/>
            distress of mind. When he saw the light and the slave <lb/>
            with the poison standing beside him, he, with great diffi­ <lb/>
            culty on account of his weakness, raised himself into a <lb/>
            Bitting posture. He then took the cup into his hand, and <lb/>
            inquired whether he knew anything about the knights, <lb/>
            especially about one Lykortas. When the slave answered, <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            that most of them had escaped, he nodded his head, looked <lb/>
            kindly upon him, and answered, " You tell me good news, <lb/>
            if we are not all unfortunate." He uttered no other word, <lb/>
            but drank the poison and laid down again. In his weak <lb/>
            condition he was unable to offer any resistance to the <lb/>
            operations of the drug, and died immediately.</p>
          <p>XXI. When the Achæan cities heard of his death, they <lb/>
            went into a general mourning for him. The men of <lb/>
            military age assembled at Megalopolis without delay, chose <lb/>
            Lykortas as their leader, invaded the Messenian territory, <lb/>
            and ravaged it until the Messenians came to their senses <lb/>
            and made terms with the Achaeans. Doinokrates escaped <lb/>
            his merited fate by suicide, as did those who had advised <lb/>
            that Philopœmen should be put to death, while those who <lb/>
            had advised that he should be tortured were themselves <lb/>
            reserved for a death of torture by Lykortas. They burned <lb/>
            his body and collected the ashes into an urn, not carelessly, <lb/>
            but mingling a sort of triumphal pomp with his funeral <lb/>
            procession. There one might see men crowned with garlands <lb/>
            but weeping at the same time, and leading along his ene­ <lb/>
            mies in chains. The urn itself, which was scarcely to be <lb/>
            seen for the garlands and ribbons with which it was covered, <lb/>
            was carried by Polybius, the son of the Achæan commander- <lb/>
            in-chief, accompanied by the noblest of the Achaeans. The <lb/>
            soldiers followed in complete armour, with caparisoned <lb/>
            horses, not cast down, but yet too sad to feel any pride in <lb/>
            their victory. As they passed through the towns and <lb/>
            villages on their way the inhabitants came out as if to <lb/>
            welcome him on his return from a successful campaign, laid <lb/>
            their hands on his urn, and joined in the procession to <lb/>
            Megalopolis. When here the old men, women, and children <lb/>
            joined them, a wail of distress ran through the whole army <lb/>
            for the unhappy city which was mourning for its hero, <lb/>
            and which thought itself to have lost, by his death, the <lb/>
            first place in Greece. He was buried with great honour, <lb/>
            as we may well believe, and round his tomb the Messenian <lb/>
            captives were stoned to death. Many statues were made <lb/>
            of him, and many honours voted to him by the Greek <lb/>
            cities, which afterwards during that unfortunate time for <lb/>
            Greece when Corinth was destroyed, a Roman proposed tc <lb/>
            destroy, accusing Philopœmen. as if he had been yet alive, <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            of being always an enemy to the Romans. But after <lb/>
            Polybius had answered this contemptible fellow, neither <lb/>
            the consul Mummius nor his lieutenants would suffer him <lb/>
            to deface and take away the honours done in memory of so <lb/>
            famous and worthy a man, although he had frequently <lb/>
            offered great opposition both to Flaniininus and to Manius- <lb/>
            They distinguished properly between honour and expedi­ <lb/>
            ency, rightly thinking that men should reward those who <lb/>
            benefit them, but that the brave should always be honoured <lb/>
            by all brave men. Thus much have I to tell about <lb/>
            Philopœmen.</p><pb n="154"/>

          </ab>
          <p>THOSE who wish to know what Titus Quintius Flamini. <lb/>
            nus, whom we have selected as a parallel to Philopoemen, <lb/>
            was like, may see his brazen statue in Rome, which stands <lb/>
            beside the great statue of Apollo from Carthage, opposite <lb/>
            to the Circus, with a Greek inscription upon it. His <lb/>
            temper is said to have been warm, both in love and in <lb/>
            anger, though he was ever moderate and placable in in­ <lb/>
            flicting punishment, while he was never weary in con­ <lb/>
            ferring favours, and was always eager to help those upon <lb/>
            whom he had bestowed some benefit, preserving and pro­ <lb/>
            tecting them as though they were the most precious of his <lb/>
            possessions. Being ambitious and eager to distinguish <lb/>
            himself, he wished to take the leading part in everything, <lb/>
            and consequently preferred those who hoped to receive to <lb/>
            those who were able to confer favours, because the former <lb/>
            were his assistants and the latter his rivals in the struggle <lb/>
            for honour.</p>
          <p>He received a military training, being born at a time <lb/>
            when Rome was engaged in most important wars, and <lb/>
            when young men learned how to act as officers not by <lb/>
            theory but by actual service in the field. He first served <lb/>
            as military tribune under the consul Marcellus in tie war <lb/>
            with Hannibal. Marcellus perished in an ambuscade, but <lb/>
            Titus was made governor of Tarentum after its recapture, <lb/>
            and of the surrounding territory. In this government, he <lb/>
            won as great a reputation for justice as for courage, so <lb/>
            that when the Romans sent colonists to the two cities of <lb/>
            Narnia and Cossa, he was appointed to lead them and act <lb/>
            as founder of the colonies.</p>
          <p>II. This so elated him that he at once aspired to the <lb/>
            consulship, passing over all the usual steps of Ædile, <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            Tribune, or Prætor, by which young men generally rose to <lb/>
            that office. When the day of election arrived, he appeared <lb/>
            with a strong following of devoted partisans from those <lb/>
            two towns. When the tribunes ofthe people, Fulvius <lb/>
            and Manius, came forward and protested against a young <lb/>
            "man .taking the-highest office- in the state bystorm, <lb/>
            contrary to the laws, and being as it were uninitiated in <lb/>
            the very elements of the constitution, the Senate referred <lb/>
            the matter to the votes of the people, who elected him <lb/>
            consul together with Sextus Ælius, although he was not <lb/>
            yet thirty years old. In casting lots for provinces the <lb/>
            war with Philip of Macedon fell to his share, greatly to <lb/>
            the advantage of the Romans, because in that war they <lb/>
            needed a general who would deal with the enemy not <lb/>
            entirely by main force, but also win them over by per­ <lb/>
            suasion and diplomacy. The kingdom of Macedonia was <lb/>
            amply sufficient for Philip, if he only fought once with <lb/>
            the Romans; but to maintain the cost of a long war, to <lb/>
            supply his troops, and afford him necessary resources, the <lb/>
            co-operation of Greece was essential to him. Unless there­ <lb/>
            fore Greece could be detached from his alliance, the war <lb/>
            could not be decided by a single battle. Greece at this <lb/>
            time had been brought but little into contact with the <lb/>
            Romans, who then for the first time interfered in her <lb/>
            politics. Unless, therefore, the Roman general had been <lb/>
            a man of high character, willing to act by diplomacy <lb/>
            rather than by war, and combining affability of address <lb/>
            with a strict sense of justice, the Greeks would have be,, n <lb/>
            unwilling to throw off their allegiance to their former <lb/>
            masters in order to place themselves under the new and <lb/>
            untried dominion of Rome. Of these honourable traits in <lb/>
            Titus's character many instances will be found in his acts.</p>
          <p>III. He learned that his predecessors, Sulpicius* and <lb/>
            Publius†. had both invaded Macedonia when the season <lb/>
            was far advanced, had begun warlike operations too late, <lb/>
            and had failed because Philip occupied the strong places <lb/>
            in the country and harassed them by c( nstant attacks upon <lb/>
            their communications and foraging parties. Flamininus <lb/>
            did not wish to follow their example, and, after wasting a <note type="footnote"> * Publius Sulpicius Galba. </note><note type="footnote"> t Publius Villius Tappulus. Cf. Livy xxxi. sqq. </note> <lb/>

            year at home in the enjoyment of the consular dignity, and <lb/>
            in taking part in the politics of Rome, to set out late in <lb/>
            the year to begin his campaign, although by this means <lb/>
            he might have extended his command over two years, by <lb/>
            acting as consul in the first, and carrying on the war as <lb/>
            proconsul during the second. He preferred to throw the <lb/>
            weight of his power as consul into the conduct of the war, <lb/>
            cared not to display the insignia of his office at Rome, but <lb/>
            obtained from the Senate the appointment of his brother <lb/>
            Lucius to the command of the fleet which was to co-operate <lb/>
            with him, took as the nucleus of his army three thousand <lb/>
            of the strongest of those veterans who -under Scipio had <lb/>
            beaten Hasdrubal in Spain and Hannibal in Africa, and <lb/>
            safely crossed over with them into Epirus. Here he found <lb/>
            Publius, with his army, watching that of Philip, which <lb/>
            held the passes near the river Apsus, but unable to effect <lb/>
            anything on account of the enemy being so strongly posted. <lb/>
            After taking over the army from Publius, whom he super­ <lb/>
            seded in its command, he reconnoitred the position. Its <lb/>
            strength is as great as that of the vale of Tempo, although <lb/>
            it wants the lovely meadows and groves of trees for which <lb/>
            the latter is celebrated. The river Apsus runs in a deep <lb/>
            ravine between vast and lofty mountains, like the Peneus <lb/>
            in appearance and swiftness, and beside it, at the foot of <lb/>
            the mountains, runs one narrow and rocky path, along <lb/>
            which it is difficult for an army to proceed even if unmo­ <lb/>
            lested, and utterly impossible it: it be held by an enemy.</p>
          <p>IV. Titus was advised by some to turn Philip's flank, <lb/>
            marching through the Dassaretid country along the Lykus, <lb/>
            which would offer no such difficulties; but he feared to <lb/>
            march far from the coast lest, like his predecessors, he <lb/>
            should become entangled in a country which could furnish <lb/>
            no supplies, be unable to force Philip to fight, and be <lb/>
            obliged to retreat to the sea again from want of the means <lb/>
            of subsistence. He determined to force his way through <lb/>
            the mountains in front, and as these were held by Philip <lb/>
            with his main body, the phalanx, his flanks being secured <lb/>
            by archers and light armed troops, skirmishes took place <lb/>
            between him and the Romans daily, with considerable loss <lb/>
            on both sides, but without any result, until some of the <lb/>
            natives of the country informed him of a path, neglected <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            by the enemy, by which they undertook to lead his army, <lb/>
            and on the third day at the latest to place it upon the <lb/>
            heights. As a guarantee of their good faith they referred <lb/>
            the Romans to Charops, the chief of the Epirot tribes, who <lb/>
            was friendly to the Romans, and co-operated with them <lb/>
            secretly, being afraid of Philip. Titus trusting in this <lb/>
            man's word sent one of the military tribunes with four <lb/>
            thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry. They were <lb/>
            guided by these peasants, who were strictly guarded, and <lb/>
            marched by night, resting by day in woods and sheltered <lb/>
            places: for the moon was full. Titus, after he had <lb/>
            despatched this force, rested his army, only skirmishing <lb/>
            slightly with the enemy lest they should entertain any <lb/>
            suspicion, until the day upon which the turning party <lb/>
            was expected to appear on the summit of the mountain <lb/>
            range. On that morning he got his whole force under <lb/>
            arms, light and heavy armed alike, and dividing it into <lb/>
            three parts himself led one body in column up to the attack <lb/>
            of the narrowest part of the pass beside the river, while <lb/>
            the Macedonians shot at him from above and disputed <lb/>
            every inequality of the ground, while on his right and <lb/>
            left the other detachments likewise vigorously attacked the <lb/>
            position. The sun rose while they were thus engaged, and <lb/>
            a light cloud of smoke, not distinct, but like a mountain <lb/>
            mist, rose from the captured heights. It was unnoticed <lb/>
            by the enemy, being behind their backs, but kept the <lb/>
            Romans, while they fought, in a state of hopeful excite­ <lb/>
            ment and suspense. When however it grew thicker and <lb/>
            blacker, and rising in a cloud proved itself without doubt <lb/>
            to be the looked-for signal, they rushed forward with a <lb/>
            shout and drove the enemy into their innermost places of <lb/>
            refuge, while those on the rocks above echoed their war­ <lb/>
            like clamour.</p>
          <p>V. A headlong flight now took place, but the enemy <lb/>
            lost only two thousand men, for the difficulties of the <lb/>
            ground made it hard to pursue. The Romans, however, <lb/>
            made themselves masters of their baggage, tents, and <lb/>
            slaves, and marched through Epirus in such an orderly <lb/>
            and well-disciplined fashion that, although the soldiers <lb/>
            were far from their ships, had not had their monthly <lb/>
            allowance of provisions served out to them, and were not <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            often near a market, they nevertheless abstained from <lb/>
            plundering a country which was abounding in riches. <lb/>
            Indeed Titus had learned that Philip passed through <lb/>
            Thessaly like a fugitive, driving the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            city to fly to the mountains for refuge, burning the cities <lb/>
            and giving all the property which could not be carried <lb/>
            away to his soldiers as plunder.</p>
          <p>As Philip therefore had given up the country to the <lb/>
            Romans, Titus besought his soldiers to march through it <lb/>
            taking as much care of it as if it were their own. This <lb/>
            good discipline was not long in bearing fruit; for as soon <lb/>
            as the Romans entered Thessaly the cities surrendered <lb/>
            themselves to Titus, while the Greeks beyond Thermopylae <lb/>
            were excited and eager for him to come to them, and in <lb/>
            Peloponnesus the Achaean league threw off allegiance to <lb/>
            Philip, and agreed to wage war against him in conjunction <lb/>
            with the Romans. The Opuntian Lokrians also sent for <lb/>
            Titus and delivered themselves up to him, although they <lb/>
            had been pressed by the Ætolians, who were allies of the <lb/>
            Romans, to allow them to take charge of their city. It is <lb/>
            said that king Pyrrhus, when from a mountain watch- <lb/>
            tower he first saw the Roman army drawn up in regular <lb/>
            order, said:—" These barbarians have nothing barbarous <lb/>
            in their military discipline." And in truth all those who <lb/>
            met Titus were compelled to echo these words. They <lb/>
            heard from the Macedonians that the leader of a barbarian <lb/>
            army was coming to destroy everything and to reduce <lb/>
            everyone to slavery: and then meeting a young and <lb/>
            pleasant looking man, who was a thorough Greek in <lb/>
            language and address, and a man of really hoble character, <lb/>
            they were marvellously fascinated by him, and on leaving <lb/>
            him filled their cities with his praises, saying that at <lb/>
            length they had found a champion for the liberties of <lb/>
            Greece. After he had proposed to Philip, as terms of <lb/>
            peace, that he should withdraw his garrisons and leave <lb/>
            Greece independent, which Philip refused to do, then even <lb/>
            those who had previously been on the side of Philip <lb/>
            admitted that the Romans had not come to fight against <lb/>
            the Greeks, but to fight with the Greeks against the <lb/>
            Macedonians.</p>
          <p>VI. The whole of Greece came to terms with him with <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            out a struggle, Thebes being the first city to send a <lb/>
            deputation to welcome him as he peacefully marched <lb/>
            through Bceotia. It was Brachyllus who had kept the <lb/>
            Thebans loyal to Philip, but now they desired to show <lb/>
            their admiration and esteem for Flamininus, being, as they <lb/>
            imagined, on terms of amity with both parties. Titus <lb/>
            received them with great courtesy, and walked gently <lb/>
            forwards with them, conversing with them and asking <lb/>
            them questions, until his soldiers, who were marching some <lb/>
            distance behind, came up with him. Then he walked <lb/>
            into the city in the company of the Thebans, not alto­ <lb/>
            gether to their satisfaction, although they did not like to <lb/>
            attempt to keep him out, as he was accompanied by a good <lb/>
            many soldiers. Yet, as if the town were not entirely at his <lb/>
            mercy, he made them a speech, urging them to side with <lb/>
            the Romans, while King Attalus spoke to the same effect, <lb/>
            encouraging the Thebans to rally to the Roman cause. <lb/>
            AttaIns, indeed, over-exerted himself in his speech, con­ <lb/>
            sidering his great age, and in consequence of a sudden <lb/>
            dizziness or faintness fell down in a fit. He was shortly <lb/>
            afterwards conveyed by sea to Asia Minor, and died there. <lb/>
            However, the Bœotians accepted the Roman alliance.</p>
          <p>VII. Philip now sent an embassy to Rome; and <lb/>
            Flamininus also sent thither to beg the Senate to allow <lb/>
            him to retain his office of consul, in case they should con­ <lb/>
            tinue the war, or if they decided otherwise, to permit him <lb/>
            to have the honour of concluding a. peace with Philip; for <lb/>
            his ambitious spirit could not endure to be superseded by <lb/>
            another commander. His friends succeeded in obtaining <lb/>
            the rejection of Philip's demands, and his own continuance <lb/>
            in office. As soon as he received this intelligence, he <lb/>
            started, full of hope, to attack Philip in Thessaly, with an <lb/>
            army of more than twenty-six thousand men, of which the <lb/>
            Ætolians supplied six thousand infantry and four hundred <lb/>
            cavalry. The army of Philip was of nearly equal numbers, <lb/>
            and they began to march towards one another until they <lb/>
            both drew near the city of Skotussa, where they determined <lb/>
            to fight a decisive battle. When the two armies found <lb/>
            themselves so near each other they felt no fear, as one <lb/>
            might have expected, but each was confident of victory. <lb/>
            The Romans were eager for the honour of overcoming the <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            Macedonians, who had gained such glory under Alexander <lb/>
            the Great; while the Macedonians, admitting the Romans <lb/>
            to he very different soldiers to the Persians, swelled with <lb/>
            pride at the thought that if they could conquer them, they <lb/>
            would prove their king Philip to be even more invincible <lb/>
            than Alexander himself. Titus also encouraged his soldiers <lb/>
            to quit them like men, pointing out that they were about <lb/>
            to fight in Greece, a noble theatre in which to display <lb/>
            deeds of daring, and against worthy antagonists; while <lb/>
            Philip, either by chance, or not noticing what he was <lb/>
            doing in his haste, mounted upon a large sepulchre out­ <lb/>
            side his camp, and from it began to make the usual speech <lb/>
            to his men to encourage them for the coming struggle, but <lb/>
            at length observing the evil omen was much disheartened <lb/>
            by it, broke off in confusion, and would not fight that <lb/>
            day.</p>
          <p>VIII. On the following morning about dawn, as the <lb/>
            night had been warm and damp, the whole plain was <lb/>
            covered with fog, and a thick mist poured down from the <lb/>
            neighbouring hills; which rendered it impossible to dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish any object. The parties which were sent out by <lb/>
            each army to reconnoitre fell in with one another and <lb/>
            fought near the place called Kynoskephalæ, that is, Dogs' <lb/>
            Heads, which is so named because a number of small hills <lb/>
            near together have something of this appearance. In the <lb/>
            combat, as usually happens in such rough ground, each <lb/>
            side alternately had the advantage, and as each gave way <lb/>
            they were reinforced from the respective camps. Now the <lb/>
            fog lifted, and the two commanders resolved upon a general <lb/>
            engagement. Philip's right wing, on which the phalanx <lb/>
            charged down-hill with all its weight, was victorious, the <lb/>
            Rtomans being unable to stand before that hedge of spears, <lb/>
            or break through that closely-locked array of shields. But <lb/>
            on the left the Macedonians were unable to maintain their <lb/>
            line, because of the inequalities of the ground, and Titus, <lb/>
            seeing that his left was hopelessly routed, rode quickly to <lb/>
            his own right, and suddenly attacked the enemy, who, <lb/>
            because of the uneven nature of the ground, were unable <lb/>
            to form their phalanx with its deep ranks, in which lies <lb/>
            the peculiar strength of that order of battle, while the <lb/>
            soldiers of which it is composed are armed in an unwieldy <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            fashion which renders them helpless in a hand-to-hand <lb/>
            fight. For the Macedonian phalanx. is like some huge <note type="footnote"> * The following is the account given of the Macedonian phalanx by <lb/>
            Polybius:— <lb/>
            " It is easy then to demonstrate by many reasons, that, while the <lb/>
            phalanx retains its proper form and full power of action, no force is <lb/>
            able to stand against it in front, or to support the violence of its attack. <lb/>
            When the ranks are closed in order to engage, each soldier, as he stands <lb/>
            in his arms, occupies a space of three feet. The spears in their most <lb/>
            ancient form, contained seventeen cubits in length. But, for the sake <lb/>
            of rendering them more commodious in action, they have since been <lb/>
            reduced to fourteen. Of these, four cubits are contained between the <lb/>
            part which the soldier grasps in his hands, and the lower end of the <lb/>
            spear behind, which serves as a counterpoise to the part that is exten- led <lb/>
            before him; and the length of this last part from the body of the <lb/>
            soldier, when the spear is pushed forwards with both hands against the <lb/>
            enemy, is by consequence ten cubits. From hence it follows, that when <lb/>
            the phalanx is closed in its proper form, and every soldier pressed <lb/>
            within the necessary distance with respect to the man that is before <lb/>
            him and upon his side, the spears of the fifth rank are extended to the <lb/>
            length of two cubits, and those of the second, third, and fourth to a still <lb/>
            greater length, beyond the foremost rank. The manner in which the <lb/>
            men are crowded together in this method is marked by Homer in the <lb/>
            following lines: <lb/>
            .., Shield stuck to shield, to helmet helmet join'd, <lb/>
            And man to man; and at each nod that bow'd, <lb/>
            High waving on their heads the glittering cones, <lb/>
            Rattl'd the hair-crown'd casques, so thick they stood.' <lb/>
            Homer, Il. xiii., 131. <lb/>
            " This description is not less exact than beautiful. It is manifest, <lb/>
            then, that five several spears, differing each from the other in the <lb/>
            length of two cubits, are extended before every man in the foremost <lb/>
            rank. And when it is considered likewise, that the phalanx is formed <lb/>
            by sixteen in depth, it will be easy to conceive, what must be the weight <lb/>
            and violence of the entire body, and how great the force of its attack. <lb/>
            In the ranks, indeed, that are behind the fifth, the spears cannot reach <lb/>
            so far as to be employed against the enemy. In these ranks, therefore, <lb/>
            the soldiers, instead of extending their spears forwards, rest them upon <lb/>
            the shoulders of the men that are before them, with their points slanting <lb/>
            upwards; and in this manner they form a kind of rampart which covers <lb/>
            their heads, and secures them against those darts which may be carried <lb/>
            in their flight beyond the first ranks, and fall upon those that are <lb/>
            behind. But when the whole body advances to charge the enemy, even <lb/>
            the hindmost ranks are of no small use and moment. For as they press <lb/>
            continually upon those that are before them, they add by their weight <lb/>
            alone great force to the attack, and deprive also the foremost ranks of <lb/>
            the power of drawing themselves backwards or retreating. Such, then, </note><note type="footnote"> VOL. U. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            beast of invincible strength so long as it remains one body, <lb/>
            close locked together in serried ranks; but when broken <lb/>
            up it loses even the advantage of each individual soldier's <lb/>
            strength, because of the fashion in which they are armed, <lb/>
            as they can only act together, not separately. When this <lb/>
            body was routed some of the Romans pursued the fugitives, <lb/>
            while others charged the victorious Macedonians in flank, <lb/>
            soon forcing them to break up their array and fly in con­ <lb/>
            fusion, throwing away their arms. There fell no less than <lb/>
            eight thousand of them, and five thousand were taken <lb/>
            prisoners. The Ætolian cavalry wore blamed for letting <lb/>
            Philip escape, because they betook themselves to plunder­ <lb/>
            ing the camp of the Macedonians even before the Romans <lb/>
            ceased their pursuit, so that on their return they found <lb/>
            that nothing had been left for them.</p>
          <p>IX. From this there arose quarrels between the Ætolians <lb/>
            and the Romans ; and afterwards they exasperated Titus <lb/>
            by taking to themselves the credit of the victory, and <lb/>
            being the first to spread abroad that report among the <lb/>
            Greeks so that they received all the honours due to vic­ <lb/>
            tors, and were mentioned first in all the poems and ballads <note type="footnote"> is the disposition of the phalanx, with regard both to the whole and the <lb/>
            several parts. Let us now consider the arms, and the order of battle, <lb/>
            of the Romans; that we may see by the comparison in what respects <lb/>
            they are different from those of the Macedonians. <lb/>
            " To each of the Roman soldiers, as he stands in arms, is allotted the <lb/>
            same space likewise of three feet. But as every soldier in the time of <lb/>
            action is constantly in motion, being forced to shift his shield continually, <lb/>
            that he may cover any part of his body against which a stroke is aimed, <lb/>
            and to vary the position of his sword, so as either to push, or to make a <lb/>
            falling stroke, there must also be a distance of three feet, the least that <lb/>
            can be allowed for performing these motions with advantage, between <lb/>
            each soldier and the man that stands next to him, Loth upon his side <lb/>
            and behind him. In charging, therefore, against the phalanx, every <lb/>
            single Roman, as he has two Macedonians opposite to him, has also ten <lb/>
            spears, which he is forced to encounter. But it is not possible for a <lb/>
            single man to cut down these spears with his sword, before they can take <lb/>
            their effect against him. Nor is it easy on the other hand to force his <lb/>
            way through them. For the men that are behind add no weight to <lb/>
            the pressure, nor any strength to the swords of those that are in the <lb/>
            foremost rank. It will be easy, therefore, to conceive, that, while the <lb/>
            phalanx retains its own proper position and strength, no troops, as I <lb/>
            before observed, can ever support the attack of it in front." <lb/>

            written about the battle. Of these, that which was most <lb/>
            in vogue was the following :­ <lb/>
            "Unwept, unburied, on this mountain high, <lb/>
            Stranger, Thessalians thirty thousand lie; <lb/>
            They fell before Ætolia's sons in war, <lb/>
            And Romans, brought by Titus from afar. <lb/>
            Æmathia weeps their loss. Bold Philip too, <lb/>
            Flies like a deer, and knows not what to do."</p>
          <p>This was written by Alkaeus to insult Philip, ex­ <lb/>
            aggerating the number of the slain; but when it came <lb/>
            to be repeated many times and by many men, it vexed <lb/>
            Titus more than Philip. The latter indeed parodied it <lb/>
            in the following lines. <lb/>
            " Unshaped, unpolished, stands a gibbet strong, <lb/>
            Upon this hill to hang Alkaeus on."</p>
          <p>But Titus, who felt that the eyes of Greece were upon <lb/>
            him, was wonderfully vexed by these incidents. For this <lb/>
            reason he conducted the operations which followed without <lb/>
            in the least degree consulting the Ætolians. They were <lb/>
            angry at this neglect, and when Titus began negotiations <lb/>
            with Philip, and received an embassy from him to treat <lb/>
            for peace, they spread it abroad throughout Greece that <lb/>
            Titus was being bribed by Philip into making peace, when <lb/>
            he had it in his power to utterly cut off and destroy that <lb/>
            power which first destroyed the independence of Greece. <lb/>
            Philip himself however put an end to this suspicion, by <lb/>
            placing himself and all his resources in the hands of Titus <lb/>
            and the people of Rome. So now Titus brought the war <lb/>
            to a close. He restored Philip to his kingdom of Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, but forbade him to interfere in the affairs of Greece. <lb/>
            He also imposed upon him a fine of a thousand talents, <lb/>
            took away all but ten of his ships of war, and sent one of <lb/>
            his two sons, Demetrius, to Rome as a hostage for the fulfil­ <lb/>
            ment of these conditions. In their making terms with Philip <lb/>
            Titus showed himself wise and provident: for Hannibal the <lb/>
            Carthaginian, who was at that time an exile, was already <lb/>
            at the court of King Antiochus, urging him to follow <lb/>
            up his good fortune and increase his empire. Antiochus <lb/>
            had already been so successful as to have gained the <lb/>
            surname of ' the Great,' and was now aiming at universal <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            dominion. lie especially intended to attack the Romans, <lb/>
            and unless Titus had foreseen this, and granted favour­ <lb/>
            able terms of peace, Philip would have been his ally, the <lb/>
            two most powerful kings of the age would have been <lb/>
            arrayed against the Romans, and a struggle no less im­ <lb/>
            portant than that of Rome against Hannibal would have <lb/>
            begun. As it was, Titus interposed this peace between <lb/>
            the two wars, finishing the one before he began the other; <lb/>
            by which means he took from one of the kings his last, <lb/>
            and from the other his first hope.</p>
          <p>X. The ten commissioners, whom the Senate despatched <lb/>
            to assist Titus in settling the affairs of Greece, advised <lb/>
            him to leave it free and independent, only keeping gar­ <lb/>
            risons in Corinth, Chalkis, and Demetrias, for safety <lb/>
            against Antiochus. Upon this the Ætolians threw off all <lb/>
            disguise, openly urged these cities to revolt, and called <lb/>
            upon Titus to loose the chains of Greece, as Philip was <lb/>
            wont to call these three cities. They asked the Greeks <lb/>
            whether they were pleased at their present bonds, which <lb/>
            were heavier, though smoother than before ; and whether <lb/>
            they still thought Titus to be their benefactor because he <lb/>
            had removed the fetters from the feet of Greece and fastened <lb/>
            them round her throat. Titus was much grieved at these <lb/>
            imputations, and at length by his representations induced <lb/>
            the Senate to desist from its design of placing garrisons <lb/>
            in these three cities, in order that the liberty which he <lb/>
            was about to bestow upon Greece might be unclogged <lb/>
            by any conditions.</p>
          <p>When the Isthmian games were being celebrated, a <lb/>
            great number of people were assembled in the arena <lb/>
            witnessing the gymnastic contests, as was natural now <lb/>
            that wars had ceased throughout Greece, and the people <lb/>
            could attend their national festivals in safety. Pro­ <lb/>
            clamation was now suddenly made by the sound of a <lb/>
            trumpet that every man should keep silence; and a herald <lb/>
            coming forward into the midst of the assembly announced <lb/>
            that the Senat9 of Rome, and Titus Quintius their consul <lb/>
            and general, h aving overcome King Philip and the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, did now henceforth give liberty to the Corin­ <lb/>
            thians, Lokrians, Phokians, Eubœans, Achæans of Phthia, <lb/>
            Magnetos, Thessalians, and Perrhæbians, with exemption <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            from garrisons and tribute, and permission to govern <lb/>
            themselves by their hereditary laws. At first all did not <lb/>
            clearly hear the proclamation, and there was a disorderly <lb/>
            tumult in the assembly, as men wondered at the words, <lb/>
            asked one another their meaning, and called upon the <lb/>
            herald to repeat them. But when silence had again been <lb/>
            obtained, and the herald, exerting his voice to the utmost, <lb/>
            repeated the proclamation, such a shout was raised that it <lb/>
            was heard as far as the sea coast, and all the spectators <lb/>
            rose from their seats, caring nothing more for the games, <lb/>
            but rushing with one accord to greet, with transports of <lb/>
            delight, the saviour and protector of Greece. On this <lb/>
            occasion was observed what is often mentioned as an <lb/>
            example of the power of human voices ; some crows, which <lb/>
            were flying over the racecourse at that moment, fell down <lb/>
            among the people. The reason of this is that the air is <lb/>
            broken and cut asunder by the vehemence and strength of <lb/>
            the voices, so as not to have its natural power to support <lb/>
            the birds, which fell down just as if they were flying <lb/>
            through a place where there was no air at all; unless in­ <lb/>
            deed it was the violence of the cry that struck the birds <lb/>
            like a shot, and so caused them to fall down dead. It may <lb/>
            be also that the air is driven round in whirlpools by such <lb/>
            shouts, as we observe happens in violent disturbances <lb/>
            of the sea.</p>
          <p>XI. As for Titus, unless he had escaped betimes when <lb/>
            the assembly broke up and rushed towards him, it is <lb/>
            thought that he could not have survived the pressure of <lb/>
            so great a multitude. The crowd surrounded his tent, <lb/>
            shouting and applauding until nightfall, when they dis­ <lb/>
            persed : but as they went, if they met any of their kin, <lb/>
            their friends, or fellow citizens, they kissed and embraced <lb/>
            them for joy, and then supped and made merry together. <lb/>
            We may well think that they had no other talk at the <lb/>
            table but of the great and terrible wars which Greece had <lb/>
            fought for her liberty, and that nevertheless she never had <lb/>
            obtained so perfect and delightful a state of freedom as <lb/>
            that which had been won for her by other men's labours, <lb/>
            almost without any blood of her own being spilt. It is <lb/>
            indeed rare to find bravery and wisdom combined in any <lb/>
            man, but it is even rarer to find a perfectly just man- <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            Agesilaus and Lysander, Nikias and Alkibiades know well <lb/>
            how to wage war and win battles both by land and by sea, <lb/>
            but they never could make their victories yield any honour­ <lb/>
            able benefit to others, or true glory to themselves. Indeed <lb/>
            with the exception of Marathon and Salamis, Platæa and <lb/>
            Thermopylae, and the campaigns of Kimon on the Eury­ <lb/>
            medon and in Cyprus, all the other battles of Greece have <lb/>
            been fought against herself, to bring about her slavery, <lb/>
            and every trophy has been a misfortune, and a monument <lb/>
            of shame rather than glory, arising chiefly from the rivalry <lb/>
            between the leading cities. Yet a strange nation, from <lb/>
            which it was inconceivable that Greece should receive any <lb/>
            benefit, with scarcely any glimmering embers, as it were, <lb/>
            of a common origin, had nevertheless, with great risk and <lb/>
            hard fighting, rescued Greece from her harsh tyrants and <lb/>
            oppressors.</p>
          <p>XII. These were the thoughts which occupied men's <lb/>
            minds: and the events which took place were all in con­ <lb/>
            formity with the proclamation. Titus had at the same <lb/>
            time sent Lentulus to Asia Minor to free the Bargylians, <lb/>
            and Stertinius to Thrace to remove the garrisons of Philip <lb/>
            from the towns and islands in that quarter, while Publius <lb/>
            Villius set sail to treat with Antiochus about the freedom <lb/>
            of the Greeks in his dominions. Titus himself proceeded <lb/>
            to Chalkis, and thence he took ship for Magnesia, where <lb/>
            he removed the foreign garrisons from the cities and re- <lb/>
            established a democratic constitution in them. After this <lb/>
            he was elected President of the Nemean games at Argos, <lb/>
            where he made admirable arrangements for the conduct of <lb/>
            the festival, and made a herald repeat his proclamation to <lb/>
            the Greeks assembled there. He now made a progress <lb/>
            through the cities of Greece, in which he established tran­ <lb/>
            quillity and good laws, encouraged them to regard each <lb/>
            other with good will, put an end to faction, and brought <lb/>
            back exiles, taking no less pride in acting as counsellor <lb/>
            and mediator to the Greeks than he did in having con­ <lb/>
            quered the Macedonians, so that liberty seemed to be the <lb/>
            least of the benefits which he had bestowed on the Greeks.</p>
          <p>It is said that when at Athens Lykurgus the orator had <lb/>
            rescued Xenokrates the philosopher from the tax-gatherers <lb/>
            who were taking him to prison for non-payment of the tax <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            upon resident aliens, and had them punished for their <lb/>
            insolent conduct towards him, Xenokrates, afterwards <lb/>
            meeting the sons of Lykurgus, said, " My children, I am <lb/>
            making your father an honourable return for his kindness, <lb/>
            he has the praises of the whole people for what he did for <lb/>
            me." Flamininus and the Romans, however, not only ob­ <lb/>
            tained the praise of the Greeks in return for the benefits <lb/>
            which they had conferred upon them, but also gained the <lb/>
            trust and confidence of all mankind by their noble acts. <lb/>
            Not only cities, but even kings who had been wronged by <lb/>
            other kings came to them for redress, so that in a short <lb/>
            space of time, with the assistance, no doubt, of the divine <lb/>
            favour, all the world became subject to them. Flamininus <lb/>
            especially prided himself on having liberated the Greeks, <lb/>
            and when he dedicated at Delphi silver shields and his <lb/>
            own Roman buckler, he wrote upon them the following <lb/>
            verses :- <lb/>
            To you, the Twins, delighting in the chase, <lb/>
            Great Zeus's sons, of Sparta's royal race, <lb/>
            This offering gives the Roman Titus, he <lb/>
            Who set the children of fair Hellas free."</p>
          <p>He also dedicated a golden wreath to Apollo, with the <lb/>
            Inscription- <lb/>
            To thee, Latona's child, this chaplet fair <lb/>
            Doth Titus, leader of Rome's army, send; <lb/>
            The crown will well beseem thy glorious hair; <lb/>
            Do thou the donor from all ill defend."</p>
          <p>Indeed it was in the city of Corinth that this favour has <lb/>
            twice been bestowed upon the Greeks, for it was in Corinth <lb/>
            that Titus made the proclamation of which we have spoken, <lb/>
            and Nero again, in our own time, in nearly the same manner, <lb/>
            during the Isthmian games, declared the Greeks free and <lb/>
            independent, except that Titus proclaimed it by means of <lb/>
            a herald, while Nero mounted upon a platform in the <lb/>
            market place and made the announcement himself. How­ <lb/>
            ever, this took place long afterwards.</p>
          <p>XIII. Titus now began a war against that most hateful <lb/>
            and lawless of despots, Nabis of Lacedæmon, but betrayed <lb/>
            the confidence of the Greeks; for when he had the oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of destroying him he would not do so, but made <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            terms with him, leaving Sparta in a shameful bondage. <lb/>
            Either he was afraid that if the war went on for any <lb/>
            length of time some new commander would be sent from <lb/>
            Rome who would gain the credit of it, or else he was <lb/>
            jealous of the honours which were paid to Philopoemen, <lb/>
            who was by far the greatest warrior in Greece at that <lb/>
            period, and who surpassed himself in acts of bravery and <lb/>
            strategy during the campaign against Nabis. The homage <lb/>
            which was paid Philopoemen in all public assemblies by <lb/>
            the Achaeans vexed Flamininus, who felt angry that a <lb/>
            mere Arcadian, who had gained some credit as a leader <lb/>
            in obscure border warfare, should be treated with as much <lb/>
            respect as the Roman consul, who was acting as the pro­ <lb/>
            tector of all the peoples of Greece. The excuse which <lb/>
            Titus himself made for terminating the war was that he <lb/>
            saw that the despot could not be dethroned without <lb/>
            causing great suffering to the other Spartans. Though <lb/>
            the Achaeans passed many decrees in his honour he cared <lb/>
            for none of them except one gift which they bestowed <lb/>
            upon him, which was as follows. Many of the Romans <lb/>
            who had been taken prisoners in the war with Hannibal <lb/>
            had been sold for slaves, and were in servitude in different <lb/>
            countries. In Greece there were twelve hundred of them, <lb/>
            men who were in any case much to be pitied for their <lb/>
            misfortune, but especially now, when as may be supposed, <lb/>
            they met their sons, brothers, and relations, who were free <lb/>
            Roman soldiers, while they themselves were slaves. Titus, <lb/>
            though grieved at their lot, did not take them forcibly <lb/>
            from their owners, but the Achaeans paid a ransom of five <lb/>
            minæ for each man, collected them into one body, and just <lb/>
            as Titus was about to set sail for home, presented them to <lb/>
            him, so that he left the scene of his glorious labours <lb/>
            having received an honourable reward, and one which <lb/>
            well befitted so great and patriotic a man, besides being <lb/>
            the most glorious ornament of his triumph : for these men <lb/>
            of their own accord, like ordinary slaves who have been <lb/>
            emancipated, shaved their beads, put on felt skull caps,* <lb/>
            and followed in the train at his triumph.</p>
          <p>XIV. A more splendid spectacle was afforded by the <note type="footnote"> * The 'pileum,' a close-fitting felt cap, was given by the Romans to <lb/>
            slaves on the occasion of their enfranchisement, as a sign of freedom. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            spoils of war, the Greek helmets, Macedonian shields, and <lb/>
            long sarissae, or pikes. used by the phalanx, which were <lb/>
            carried along in the procession. There was also no incon­ <lb/>
            siderable sum of money, for Tuditanus tell us that in this <lb/>
            triumph there were displayed three thousand seven hundred <lb/>
            and thirteen pounds of gold coin, forty-three thousand <lb/>
            two hundred and seventy pounds of silver coin, and four­ <lb/>
            teen thousand five hundred and fourteen gold coins of <lb/>
            King Philip, besides the thousand talents which he owed. <lb/>
            These, however, the Romans, at the instance of Flamininus, <lb/>
            forgave him, and released his son who had been kept as <lb/>
            a hostage for their payment.</p>
          <p>XV. When Antiochus entered Greece with a large <lb/>
            naval and military force, many of the Greek states joined <lb/>
            -him, especially the Ætolians, who eagerly espoused his <lb/>
            cause because of their old quarrel with Rome. They gave <lb/>
            out as a pretext for beginning the war, that they intended <lb/>
            to restore freedom to the Greeks, who required nothing of <lb/>
            sort,being free already. This, however, was merely <lb/>
            said because it. was the most plausible excuse for their <lb/>
            conduct, for which they could not assign any creditable <lb/>
            reason. The Romans were much alarmed at the import­ <lb/>
            ance of this insurrection. They sent Manius Acilius as <lb/>
            consul and commander-in-chief to conduct the war, and <lb/>
            despatched Titus Flamininus on a diplomatic mission to <lb/>
            the cities of Greece. The mere sight of him confirmed the <lb/>
            wavering loyalty of some of these states, while his personal <lb/>
            influence induced many which had taken the first steps <lb/>
            towards revolt, to return to their allegiance. Some few, <lb/>
            however, were hopelessly lost to the Roman cause, having <lb/>
            been previously won over by the Ætolians; yet, vexed <lb/>
            and exasperated as he was by their conduct, he took care, <lb/>
            after the victory had been won, that even these should not <lb/>
            be destroyed. Antiochus, it is well known, was defeated <lb/>
            at Thermopylae, and at once set sail for Asia Minor, while <lb/>
            the consul Manius besieged some of the Ætolian strong- <lb/>
            holds himself, and arranged for others to be taken by King <lb/>
            Philip of Macedon. But when the towns in Dolopi, <lb/>
            Magnesia, and Aperantia were being despoiled by Philip, <lb/>
            and the consul Manius had taken Heraklea and Was <lb/>
            besieging Naupaktus, an Ætolian fortress, Flamininus, <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            pitying the Greeks, left Peloponnesus and sailed to the <lb/>
            consul at Naupaktus. At first he reproached him with <lb/>
            conquering Antiochus, and then allowing Philip to reap <lb/>
            all the advantages of his victory, and with wasting time <lb/>
            in besieging one city out of pique, while the Macedonians <lb/>
            were adding tribes and kingdoms to their empire. After <lb/>
            this, as the besieged, when they saw him, called upon him <lb/>
            by name from the walls, and stretched out their hands to <lb/>
            him with tears and entreaties, he made no answer to them <lb/>
            but turned away and wept. Afterwards, however, he <lb/>
            reasoned with Manius, and persuaded him to put aside his <lb/>
            resentment, and to grant the Ætolians a truce, and time to <lb/>
            send an embassy to Rome to arrange reasonable terms of <lb/>
            peace.</p>
          <p>XVI. He was given most trouble of all by the petitions <lb/>
            of the Cbalkidians to Manius for peace. These people were <lb/>
            especially obnoxious to the Romans because Antiochus, at <lb/>
            the commencement of the war, had married the daughter of <lb/>
            a citizen of Chalkis. The match was both unseasonable <lb/>
            in point of time, and unequal in respect of age, as he was <lb/>
            an elderly man when he fell in love with the girl, who <lb/>
            was the daughter of one Kleoptolemus, and is said to <lb/>
            have been of exceeding beauty. This marriage caused the <lb/>
            Chalkidians to become eager partizans of King Antiochus, <lb/>
            and even to offer him their city for his headquarters <lb/>
            during the war. After his defeat he retreated at once to <lb/>
            Chalkis, and then, taking his bride, his treasure, and his <lb/>
            friends with him, set sail for Asia. Manius at once <lb/>
            marched upon Chalkis in a rage, but Flaminius accom­ <lb/>
            panied him, and by his entreaties at length calmed and <lb/>
            pacified him. The people of Chalkis, after this narrow <lb/>
            escape, dedicated the largest and most magnificent of all <lb/>
            their public buildings to Titus, the inscriptions on which <lb/>
            may be read even at the present day. " The people <lb/>
            dedicate this gymnasium to Herakles and to Titus." And <lb/>
            on the other side of the road we read " The people dedicate <lb/>
            the Delphinium to Apollo and to Titus." Moreover even <lb/>
            in our own times a priest of Titus is chosen by show of <lb/>
            hands, who offers sacrifice to him. After the libations <lb/>
            they sing a specially-written poem, too long for quota­ <lb/>
            tion from which we extract the following verses:— <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            " Sing, maidens, sing, <lb/>
            Of Rome'a good faith that keeps its oath, <lb/>
            And gentle Titus full of truth, <lb/>
            Our city a saviour, Titus and Apollo sing.”</p>
          <p>XVII. lIe also received honours from the Greeks at <lb/>
            large, and that which gives reality to honours, great good­ <lb/>
            will from all for his kindly disposition. For though <lb/>
            indeed he had some slight differences with Philopoemen, <lb/>
            and again with Diophanes when chief of the Achaean <lb/>
            league, he was not rancorous, and never acted under the <lb/>
            impulse of anger, but soon laid aside his displeasure. He <lb/>
            was harsh to no one, but was thought by most men to be <lb/>
            clever and witty, and the pleasantest of companions. <lb/>
            When the Achaeans were endeavouring to gain for <lb/>
            themselves the island of Zakynthus, he discouraged their <lb/>
            enterprise by saying that if they proceeded so far from <lb/>
            Peloponnesus they would be in the same danger as the <lb/>
            tortoise when he stretches his head out beyond his shell.</p>
          <p>When Philip first met him to discuss terms of peace, <lb/>
            and observed that Titus had come with a large suite, <lb/>
            while he was alone, Titus answered, " You by your own act <lb/>
            have made yourself lonely, by having killed all your <lb/>
            friends and relations.” Once at Rome Deinokrates the <lb/>
            Messenian got drunk and danced in women's clothes, and <lb/>
            on the next day begged Titus to assist him in his design <lb/>
            of detaching Messenia from the Achaean league. Titus <lb/>
            answered that he would consider the matter, but that he <lb/>
            wondered that a man engaged in such important designs <lb/>
            should sing and dance over his wine. When the ambassa­ <lb/>
            dors of Antiochus were telling the Achaeans the number <lb/>
            of the king's army and were enumerating the various <lb/>
            forces of which it was composed under various designa­ <lb/>
            tions, Titus remarked that when dining with his host he <lb/>
            had been surprised at the variety of meats, and had ex­ <lb/>
            pressed his wonder as to how he had been able to obtain <lb/>
            so many different kinds; but his host informed him that <lb/>
            it was all nothing more than pork disguised by various <unclear/> <lb/>
            sauces and cooked in various ways. “ So now." continued <lb/>
            he, " men of Achaea, do not be alarmed at the power of <lb/>
            Antiochus when you hear these catalogues of spearmen <lb/>
            and lance-bearers and foot-guards; for they are all <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            nothing more than Syrians disguised with different kind <lb/>
            of arms.</p>
          <p>XVIII. After the pacification of Greece and the end of <lb/>
            the war with Antiochus, Flamininus was elected censor, <lb/>
            which is the highest office at Rome, and is as it were the <lb/>
            goal of political life. His colleague was Marcellus, the <lb/>
            son of him that was five times consul. They ejected from <lb/>
            the Senate four men of no reputation, and admitted into <lb/>
            it all the candidates who were of free birth, being forced <lb/>
            to do so by the tribune of the people Terentius Culeo, who <lb/>
            by his invectives against the patricians had induced the <lb/>
            people to pass a decree to that effect.</p>
          <p>The two most prominent men in Rome at this time were <lb/>
            Scipio Africanus and Marcus Cato. Of these Titus ap- <lb/>
            -pointed Scipio to be President of the Senate, as being the <lb/>
            first man in the state, but he quarrelled with Cato for <lb/>
            the following reason. Titus had a brother, Lucius Flam­ <lb/>
            ininus, who was very unlike himself in disposition, being <lb/>
            licentious in his pleasures and careless of his reputation. <lb/>
            He had a favourite whom he always took with him even <lb/>
            when he was in command of an army or governor of a <lb/>
            province. This boy once at a wine party said that he was <lb/>
            so greatly attached to Lucius, that he left a show of <lb/>
            gladiatoi s before he had seen a man killed, to please him. <lb/>
            Lucius, delighted at this proof of affection, said, “ That is <lb/>
            easily remedied ; I will gratify your wish." He ordered <lb/>
            a condemned criminal to be brought, sent for the execu­ <lb/>
            tioner, and bade him strike off the man's head in the <lb/>
            banquetting chamber. Valerius of Antium says that <lb/>
            Lucius did this to please a female, not a male favourite. <lb/>
            But Livy says that in Cato's own speech on the subject we <lb/>
            are told that Lucius, to gratify his favourite, slew with <lb/>
            his own hand a Gaulish deserter who came with his wife <lb/>
            and children to the door, and whom he had himself invited <lb/>
            into the banquetting chamber. It is probable that Cato <lb/>
            added these particulars to exaggerate the horror of the <lb/>
            story, for Cicero the Orator, who gives the story in his <lb/>
            book ‘On Old Age,' and many other writers, say that the <lb/>
            man was not a desurter, but a criminal, and condemned to <lb/>
            death.</p>
          <p>XIX. In consequence of this, Cato, when censor, removed <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            Lucius from the Senate, although he was of consular rank, <lb/>
            and although his degradation affected his brother as well <lb/>
            as himself. Both of them now presented themselves <lb/>
            before the people poorly clad and in tears, and appeared <lb/>
            to be making a very reasonable demand in begging Cato <lb/>
            to state the grounds upon which he had cast such ignominy <lb/>
            upon an honourable family. Cato, however, not in the <lb/>
            least affected by this, came forward with his colleague and <lb/>
            publicly demanded of Titus whether he was acquainted <lb/>
            with what happened at the banquet. When Titus <lb/>
            answered that he knew nothing of it, Cato related the <lb/>
            circumstances, challenging Lucius to contradict him if he <lb/>
            spoke untruly. As Lucius remained silent, the people <lb/>
            saw that his degradation had been deserved, and Cato <lb/>
            retired in triumph. Titus, vexed at what had befallen <lb/>
            his brother, now joined the party of Cato's enemies, <lb/>
            objected to all purchases, lettings, and sales by the Senate <lb/>
            of public property which had been made by Cato, and <lb/>
            carried his point so far as to have them all declared void. <lb/>
            Thus he, I cannot say justly, became the violent opponent <lb/>
            of a legally constituted official and an excellent citizen, for <lb/>
            the sake of a man who, though his brother, was a worth­ <lb/>
            less character and had only met with his deserts. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, on one occasion, when the Roman people were <lb/>
            witnessing some spectacle in the theatre, the Senate, as <lb/>
            is customary, sitting in the best place in great state, they <lb/>
            were filled with compassion on seeing Lucius Flamininus <lb/>
            sitting on the back benches in a mean dress, and the <lb/>
            people became so excited that they could not restrain their <lb/>
            cries to him to resume his former seat, until at length <lb/>
            he did so, and was welcomed by the other consulars.</p>
          <p>XX. The ambitious character of Titus gained him much <lb/>
            glory, while he was in the prime of life, in the wars of <lb/>
            which we have made mention: for after his consulship he <lb/>
            again served in the army as military tribune; but when he <lb/>
            retired from public life, being an elderly man, he often <lb/>
            incurred the blame of his countrymen from his desire to <lb/>
            distinguish himself. For instance, his conduct in regard <lb/>
            to Hannibal made him much disliked at Rome. Hannibal <lb/>
            after his escape from Carthage, joined king Antiochus, but <lb/>
            when Antiochus, after his defeat in Phrygia, was glad to <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            accept terms of peace from the Romans, he again became <lb/>
            and exile, and after many wanderings, at length settled <lb/>
            at the court of Prusias, king of Bithynia. Every one at <lb/>
            Rome knew that he was there, but no one wished to <lb/>
            meddle with him because of his age and weakness, as he <lb/>
            appeared to be deserted by fortune. However, Titus was <lb/>
            sent to Prusias on an embassy about certain other matters, <lb/>
            and seing Hannibal there took offence at his being alive, <lb/>
            and would not accede to the prayers and entreaties of <lb/>
            Prusias on behalf of his suppliant. There was, it seems, <lb/>
            a certain oracle which ends with this verse:­ <lb/>
            “Libyssa's earth shall cover Hannibal." <lb/>
            Now Hannibal himself took this to mean Libya, and that <lb/>
            he should be buried at Carthage; but in Bithynia there <lb/>
            is a shingly tract by the seashore near which is a large <lb/>
            village named Libyssa, in which Hannibal was living. <lb/>
            As he mistrusted the weakness of Prusias and feared <lb/>
            the Romans, lie had previously to this arranged seven <lb/>
            ways of escape leading from his own room into different <lb/>
            subterranean passages, all of which led into the open <lb/>
            air by concealed apertures. When then he heard that <lb/>
            Titus insisted upon his death he endeavoured to escape <lb/>
            by one of these passages, but finding every outlet watched <lb/>
            by the soldiers of Prusias he determined to die by <lb/>
            his own hand. Some say that he destroyed himself by <lb/>
            winding his cloak round his neck, and ordered a slave to <lb/>
            place his knee in the small of his back and pull the cloak <lb/>
            violently until he choked ; while some tell us that he <lb/>
            imitated Themistokles and Midas, by drinking bull'is blood. <lb/>
            Livy * says that he prepared some poison which he kept <lb/>
            by him ready for such an emergency, and that as he was <lb/>
            about to drink it he said :—“ Let us set the Roman people <lb/>
            free from their terrible auxiety, since they think it long <lb/>
            to wait for the death of the old man whom they hate. How­ <lb/>
            ever, Titus will not gain a glorious victory, or one worthy <lb/>
            of his ancestors, who sent to bid Pyrrhus beware of poison, <lb/>
            although he was their enemy and actually at war with <lb/>
            them."</p>
          <p>XXI. Thus is Hannibal said to have perished. When <note type="footnote"> * Livy xxxix, chapter 51. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            the news was brought to the Senate many thought that <lb/>
            Titus had acted officiously and cruelly in putting Hannibal <lb/>
            to death, when he was living unharmed and helpless, <lb/>
            merely in order to obtain the credit of having killed him. <lb/>
            When they reflected upon the mildness and magnanimity <lb/>
            of Scipio Africanus they wondered yet more, for Scipio, <lb/>
            after vanquishing the terrible and unconquered Hannibal <lb/>
            in Libya, did not drive him into exile, or insist upon his <lb/>
            countrymen delivering him up. He actually met him on <lb/>
            friendly terms before the battle, and when he made a <lb/>
            treaty with him after his victory he did not bear himself <lb/>
            unseemly or insult his rival's misfortune. It is related <lb/>
            that they met again in Ephesus, and that as they walked <lb/>
            together Hannibal took the place of honour, while <lb/>
            Africanus walked contentedly beside him. Their conver­ <lb/>
            sation turned upon great generals, and when Hannibal <lb/>
            stated his opinion that the best of generals was Alexander, <lb/>
            next to him Pyrrhus, and next himself, Scipio, with a <lb/>
            quiet smile, asked him: “What would you have said, if I <lb/>
            had not conquered you ?" “ In that case, Scipio," answered <lb/>
            Hannibal," I should not have reckoned myself third but <lb/>
            first of generals." The people remembering this cried <lb/>
            shame upon Titus, for having laid hands upon a man <lb/>
            whom another had slain.- Some few, however, praised the <lb/>
            deed, thinking that Hannibal, as long as he lived, was a <lb/>
            fire which might easily be fanned into a destructive con­ <lb/>
            flagration. They pointed out that even when he was in <lb/>
            the prime of life it was not his bodily strength or personal <lb/>
            prowess that made him so terrible to the Romans, but his <lb/>
            intellect and skill, together with his inveterate hatred of <lb/>
            Rome, none of which had been diminished by age, but <lb/>
            that his natural gifts remained the same, while also <lb/>
            fortune was wont to change, and so those who had any <lb/>
            permanent cause of enmity with another nation were ever <lb/>
            encouraged by hopes of success to make new attacks. <lb/>
            Indeed subsequent events seemed to prove Titus right, as <lb/>
            Aristonikus, the son of the harp-player, in his admiration <note type="footnote"> * In Greek warfare, any one who killed an enemy in battle was <lb/>
            entitled to dispose of his body and arms as he thought fit. Plutarch <lb/>
            means that by the laws of war Hannibal belonged to Scipir, and that <lb/>
            Flamininus had no right to interfere between them. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            for Eumenes, filled the whole of Asia with revolt and revo­ <lb/>
            lution, while Mithridates, after his tremendous losses at the <lb/>
            hands of Sulla and Fimbria, again gathered together such <lb/>
            groat forces both by land and sea to oppose Lucullus. <lb/>
            Yet Hannibal did not fall so low as Caius Marius. The <lb/>
            former was to the last the friend of a king, and spent his <lb/>
            time in sailing in ships, riding on horseback, and in the <lb/>
            study of how to keep a military force efficient; whereas <lb/>
            the Romans, who had laughed Marius to scorn as he wan­ <lb/>
            dered a beggar in Africa, soon licked the dust before him <lb/>
            while he flogged and slaughtered them in Rome. Thus <lb/>
            no one of our present circumstances can be said to be either <lb/>
            important or trifling, great or small, in comparison with <lb/>
            what is to come, but we only cease to change when we <lb/>
            cease to exist.</p>
          <p>For this reason some say that Titus did not effect this <lb/>
            of his own free will, but that he was sent with Lucius <lb/>
            Scipio as a colleague on an embassy whose sole object was <lb/>
            the death of Hannibal. Now, as after these events we <lb/>
            know of no other acts of Titus either as a warrior or <lb/>
            statesman, and as he died a peaceful death, it is time to <lb/>
            begin our comparison.</p><pb n="177"/>

            <title type="sub">COMPARISON OF PHILOPŒMEN AND TITUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. IT would be impossible to compare Philopœmen, or <lb/>
            many better men than Philopœmen, with Titus, in respect <lb/>
            of the benefits which each conferred upon the Greeks. <lb/>
            Philopœmen and the others were all Greeks, who fought <lb/>
            with other Greeks, while Titus was not a Greek, and yet <lb/>
            fought on behalf of the Greeks. When Philopoemen <lb/>
            despaired of helping his hard-pressed fellow citizens and <lb/>
            sailed to Crete, Titus was gaining a victory in the centre <lb/>
            of Greece, in consequence of which he bestowed freedom <lb/>
            on Philip himself, and on all the nations and cities which <lb/>
            had been subject to him. If one carefully examines the <lb/>
            battles fought by each commander, it will appear that <lb/>
            Philopœmen killed more Greeks when he was general of <lb/>
            the Achæans than Titus killed Macedonians when he was <lb/>
            fighting for Greece. The faults of the one arose from ambi­ <lb/>
            tion, those of the other from party spirit; the latter was <lb/>
            easily moved to anger, the former hard to appease. Titus <lb/>
            preserved for Philip the semblance of royal power, and <lb/>
            treated even the Ætolians with indulgence, while Philo­ <lb/>
            pœmen in his anger detached the confederation of villages <lb/>
            from his native city. Moreover, Titus was always a friend <lb/>
            to those whom he had once befriended, while Philopoemen's <lb/>
            kindly feelings were easily overruled by passion. Indeed <lb/>
            he appears to have sacrificed his life to rage and bitter <lb/>
            personal rancour, by invading Messenia before anything <lb/>
            was ready, without showing any of the prudent caution <lb/>
            of Titus in military matters.</p>
          <p>IL The fame of Philopœmen's skill as a general, how­ <lb/>
            ever, rests on a more secure basis, the number of his battles <lb/>
            and trophies of victory. Flamininus decided his campaign <lb/>
            against Philip by two battles, but Philopœmen fought in- <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            numerable battles, and never let it be supposed that be <lb/>
            owed more to fortune than to skill.. Moreover, Titus had <lb/>
            at his disposal the resources of Rome, then in the zenith of <lb/>
            her strength, while Philopœmen had the glory of perform­ <lb/>
            ing his greatest exploits at a time when Greece was in <lb/>
            her decadence, so that his work was all his own, while the <lb/>
            glory of the Roman must be shared with his countrymen. <lb/>
            The one was the leader of good soldiers, but the other by <lb/>
            his leadership made good soldiers. That his conflicts were <lb/>
            all against Greeks was unfortunate, but gives a strong <lb/>
            proof of his powers; for among men who are alike in other <lb/>
            respects, victory must be won by sheer courage. He fought <lb/>
            the most warlike of the Greeks, the Cretans and the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, the first of whom are the most deeply versed <lb/>
            in stratagem, while the latter are most renowned for brav­ <lb/>
            ery, and overcame them both. In addition to this it must <lb/>
            be remembered that Titus found his materials ready for <lb/>
            use, as he received the arms and disciplined troops of his <lb/>
            predecessor, while Philopœmen himself introduced a new <lb/>
            method of armament and discipline; so that the one was <lb/>
            obliged to discover the means of obtaining victory, while <lb/>
            the other had only to use them. Philopoemen too did <lb/>
            many great feats in hand to hand fight, whereas Titus did <lb/>
            nothing, for which one of the Ætolians, Archedemus, jeered <lb/>
            at him, saying that while he himself was running sword <lb/>
            in hand to attack the Macedonian phalanx, Titus was <lb/>
            standing still and raising his hands to heaven in prayer <lb/>
            to the gods.</p>
          <p>III. Nevertheless Titus both as a general and an ambas­ <lb/>
            sador always met with complete success, while Philopoemen <lb/>
            acted as vigorously and successfully on behalf of the <lb/>
            Achæans when in a private station as when he was their <lb/>
            general. It was as a private citizen that he drove Nabis <lb/>
            out of Messene and liberated the Messenians, and as a <lb/>
            private citizen he shut the gates of Sparta against Dio­ <lb/>
            phanes the Achæan general and Titus himself when they <lb/>
            were on their march against it, and so saved the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians from destruction. Thus, having the true spirit <lb/>
            of a commander, he knew when to obey and when to over­ <lb/>
            ride the laws, acting according to them when it was fitting <lb/>
            to do so, but holding him to be the true general who up­ <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            held the spirit of the laws without being fettered by them, <lb/>
            The kindly treatment of the Greeks by Titus was honour <lb/>
            able to him, but the sturdy spirit of independence which <lb/>
            Philopoemen showed towards the Romans was still more <lb/>
            honourable, because it is much easier to grant a request to <lb/>
            suppliants, than to irritate those who are more powerful <lb/>
            by opposing them. Since, then, it is difficult to distinguish <lb/>
            their respective merits by comparison, let us see whether <lb/>
            we shall not decide best between them by assigning the <lb/>
            palm for military and soldierlike qualities to Greek, and <lb/>
            to the Roman that for justice and goodness of heart. <note type="footnote"> <unclear>K2</unclear> </note> <pb n="180"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF PYRRHUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. HISTORIANS tell us that after the flood the first king <lb/>
            of the Thesprotians and Molossians was Phaethon, who <lb/>
            was one of those who came into Epirus under Pelasgus ; <lb/>
            while some say that Deukalion and Pyrrha after founding <lb/>
            the temple at Dodona lived there in the country of the <lb/>
            Molossians. In later times Neoptolemus, the son of <lb/>
            Achilles, brought an army thither, obtained possession of <lb/>
            the country, and founded a dynasty of kings, who were <lb/>
            named after him the sons of Pyrrhus: for Pyrrhus was <lb/>
            his own nickname as a child, and he also gave the name of <lb/>
            Pyrrhus to one of his children by his wife Lanassa, the <lb/>
            daughter of Kleodæus, who was the son of Hyllus. From <lb/>
            this period Achilles has been honoured like a god in Epirus <lb/>
            and is called Aspetus in the dialect of the country. After <lb/>
            the earliest kings, the dynasty sunk into barbarism, and <lb/>
            ceased to attract attention from its weakness and obscurity. <lb/>
            Of those of later days, Tharrhypas was the first of those <lb/>
            who made himself famous. He adopted the customs and <lb/>
            letters of Greece, and gave just laws to his country. <lb/>
            Tharrhypas was the father of Alketas, who was the father <lb/>
            of Arybas, who married Troas and by her became the <lb/>
            father of Æakides. This man married Phthia the daughter <lb/>
            of Menon of Thessaly, who had gained great distinction in <lb/>
            the Lamian war, and who yielded in reputation to no one <lb/>
            except to Leosthenes himself. By Phthia Æakides had <lb/>
            two daughters, Deidameia and Troas, and one son, Pyrrhus.</p>
          <p>II. When the Molossians revolted, drove out their king <lb/>
            Æakides, and invited back the children of Neoptolemus to <lb/>
            the kingdom, the friends of Æakides were seized and put <lb/>
            to death, but Androkleides and Angelus stole away Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            who was still an infant and was being searched for by his <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            enemies. They took with them some wet nurses for the <lb/>
            child and some few other servants, but finding their flight <lb/>
            impeded by them, they entrusted the child to Androkleion, <lb/>
            Hippias, and Neander, strong and trusty young men, bid­ <lb/>
            ding them hurry on with what speed they might, anti get <lb/>
            to Megara, a fort belonging to the Macedonians, while they <lb/>
            themselves, partly by entreaties and partly by fighting, <lb/>
            managed to delay the pursuers till late in the evening. <lb/>
            The enemy, after making their way through these men <lb/>
            with some difficulty, pursued those who were carrying off <lb/>
            Pyrrhus. The sun had now set, and the fugitives had <lb/>
            begun to hope that they would soon be safe, when they <lb/>
            were filled with despair by meeting with the river which <lb/>
            runs past the fort, a wild torrent which they found it im­ <lb/>
            possible to cross, as the stream was swollen with recent <lb/>
            rains, and appeared all the more terrible because of the <lb/>
            darkness. They decided that they never could convey the <lb/>
            child and his nurses across by their own exertions, but <lb/>
            observing several of the inhabitants standing upon the <lb/>
            further bank they besought them to assist their passage, <lb/>
            and they showed Pyrrhus to them, crying aloud and hold­ <lb/>
            ing out their hands to entreat for help. The men could <lb/>
            not hear what they said because of the roaring of the <lb/>
            water, and much time was wasted in vain clamouring <lb/>
            until one of the fugitives, perceiving this, wrote with the <lb/>
            tongue of a brooch upon a piece of oak bark a few words <lb/>
            explaining who the child was, and in what danger, wrap­ <lb/>
            ped the piece of bark round a stone to steady its flight, <lb/>
            and threw it across. Some say that they fastened the <lb/>
            bark to a javelin and so hurled it across. When the men <lb/>
            on the further bank read the letter, and perceived in what <lb/>
            imminent peril the fugitives were, they cut down some <lb/>
            trees, formed a raft, and so crossed over. It chanced that <lb/>
            the first man who crossed and received Pyrrhus into his <lb/>
            arms was named Achilles: the rest of the fugitives were <lb/>
            ferried over by his companions.</p>
          <p>III. Having thus escaped from their pursuers they pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to Glaukias, the king of the Illyrians. They found <lb/>
            him sitting at home with his wife, and they laid the child <lb/>
            on the ground between them. The king was full of thought, <lb/>
            for he feared Kassander, the mortal enemy of Æakides, and <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            he remained silent for a long time. Meanwhile Pyrrhua <lb/>
            of his own accord crawled up to Glaukias, took hold of his <lb/>
            cloak and then stood up at his knees, causing the king <lb/>
            first to smile and then to feel pity for him, as he stood like <lb/>
            a suppliant holding his knees and weeping. Some say <lb/>
            that he did not embrace Glaukias, but that he laid hold of <lb/>
            an altar and stood, putting his hands round it, so that <lb/>
            Glaukias thought that he must be acting under some divine <lb/>
            impulse. In consequence of this he at once gave Pyrrhus <lb/>
            in charge to his wife, bidding her bring him up with her <lb/>
            own children. Shortly after, when his enemies demanded <lb/>
            that he should be given up, and Kassander even offered <lb/>
            two hundred talents, Glaukias refused to betray him, and <lb/>
            when he was twelve years of age he marched into Epirus <lb/>
            with an army and restored him to the throne.</p>
          <p>The appearance of PyrrhuB was more calculated to <lb/>
            strike terror into the beholder than to impress him with <lb/>
            an idea of the dignity which becomes a king. He had not <lb/>
            a number of separate teeth, but one continuous bone in his <lb/>
            upper jaw, with only slight lines showing the divisions <lb/>
            between the teeth. He was thought to be able to cure <lb/>
            diseases of the spleen by sacrificing a white cock, and then <lb/>
            gently pressing with his right foot in the region of the <lb/>
            spleen of the sufferer, who lay upon his back meanwhile. <lb/>
            No man was so poor or despised that Pyrrhus would not <lb/>
            touch him for this disorder if requested to do so. He also <lb/>
            received, as a reward, the cock which was sacrificed, and <lb/>
            was much pleased with this present. It is said that the <lb/>
            great toe of that foot had some divine virtue, so that when <lb/>
            the rest of his body was burned after his death, it was <lb/>
            found unhurt and untouched by the fire. But of this <lb/>
            hereafter.</p>
          <p>IV. When he was about seventeen years of age, and <lb/>
            appeared to be firmly established upon his throne, he <lb/>
            chanced to leave the country to attend the wedding of one <lb/>
            of the sons of Glaukias, with whom he had been brought <lb/>
            up. The Molossians now again rose in revolt, drove out <lb/>
            his friends, sacked the treasury, and made Neoptolemus <lb/>
            their king. Pyrrhus having thus lost his kingdom, and <lb/>
            being entirely destitute, fled for refuge to Demetri is, <lb/>
            the son of Antigonus, who had married his sister <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            Deidameia. When a young girl Deidameia had been <lb/>
            nominally the wife of Alexander, the son of Roxana, but <lb/>
            after the misfortunes of that family Demetrius had <lb/>
            married her when she came of age. In the great battle <lb/>
            of Ipsus, in which all the successors of Alexander the <lb/>
            Great took part, Pyrrhus, while yet a youth, served with <lb/>
            the forces of Demetrius, routed those who opposed him, and <lb/>
            gained great distinction. He did not desert Demetrius after <lb/>
            his defeat, but was entrusted with the care of those cities <lb/>
            which Demetrius possessed in Greece, and kept them faith­ <lb/>
            ful to his cause. When he made a treaty with Ptolemy, <lb/>
            Pyrrhus was sent to Egypt as a hostage, where he hunted <lb/>
            and practised gymnastics with Ptolemy, showing great <lb/>
            bodily strength and endurance. Observing that Berenike <lb/>
            was the most powerful and intelligent of Ptolemy's wives, <lb/>
            he paid especial court to her, and, as he knew well how to <lb/>
            gain the favour of the powerful, though he was inclined <lb/>
            to domineer over his inferiors, and was temperate and <lb/>
            well-behaved, he was chosen out of many other noble <lb/>
            youths to be the husband of Antigone, one of the daughters <lb/>
            of Berenike, whom she bore to Philip before the married <lb/>
            Ptolemy,</p>
          <p>V. His influence was greatly increased by this match, <lb/>
            and, as Antigone proved a good wife to him and furthered <lb/>
            his designs, he prevailed upon his friends to supply him <lb/>
            with money and troops, and send him upon an expedition <lb/>
            to recover his throne in Epirus. When he landed, many <lb/>
            of the people of the country were willing to accept him <lb/>
            as their king, because of their dislike to the ferocious and <lb/>
            arbitrary rule of Neoptolemus; but he, fearing that if he <lb/>
            drove out his rival he would apply to some of the kings,* <lb/>
            made terms and friendship with him, and agreed to share <lb/>
            the kingdom. As time went on, however, many en­ <lb/>
            couraged him to attack Neoptolemus, and fomented <lb/>
            suspicion between them. Pyrrhus, however, was especially <lb/>
            exasperated by the following incidents. It was customary <lb/>
            for the kings of Epirus to sacrifice to Zeus Areios in <lb/>
            Passaron, a place in the Molossian country, and to take an <lb/>
            oath to their subjects that they would govern according <note type="footnote"> * By 'Kings' throughout this ‘Life,’ Plutarch refers to the suc­ <lb/>
            cessors of Alexander the Great. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            to the laws, while the people on their part swore to be <lb/>
            faithful to the throne. These ceremonies were performed <lb/>
            by both the kings, who, with their friends, afterwards <lb/>
            conversed together, giving and receiving presents. Now <lb/>
            Gelon, a trusty friend of Neoptolemus, after giving Pyrrhus <lb/>
            a friendly welcome, presented to him two yoke of oxen <lb/>
            for the plough. Myrtilus, the cupbearer, who was present, <lb/>
            asked Pyrrhus for these oxen, and as Pyrrhus did not give <lb/>
            them to him but to some one else, he did not conceal his <lb/>
            annoyance, which was observed by Gelon. He at once <lb/>
            invited Myrtilus to dinner and proposed to him that he <lb/>
            should join the party of Neoptolemus and remove Pyrrhus <lb/>
            by poison. Myrtilus apparently acquiesced, and accepted <lb/>
            the offer, but told the whole intrigue to Pyrrhus, who bade <lb/>
            him put Alexikrates, his chief cupbearer, also in communi­ <lb/>
            cation with Get on, on the pretence that he too wished to <lb/>
            to take part in the plot; for he wished as many persons <lb/>
            as possible to know of the attempt which was about to be <lb/>
            made. Thus Gelon was deceived, and in turn deceived <lb/>
            Neoptolemus, who, imagining his plot to be on the point <lb/>
            of success, could not restrain his delight, but let out the <lb/>
            secret to his friends. On one occasion, when in his cups, <lb/>
            he talked freely about this matter to his sister Kadmeia, <lb/>
            not imagining that any one else heard him ; for there was <lb/>
            no one present except Phænarete, the wife of Samon the <lb/>
            king's neatherd, and she lay upon a couch with her face <lb/>
            towards the wall, apparently asleep. However she heard <lb/>
            all that passed, unsuspected, and next day went to <lb/>
            Antigone, the wife of Pyrrhus, and told her all that she <lb/>
            had heard N eoptolemus say to his sister. When Pyrrhus <lb/>
            heard this he did not act at once; but when next he offered <lb/>
            sacrifice he invited Neoptolemus to dinner and killed <lb/>
            him, as he knew that the strongest party in Epirus was <lb/>
            on his side, and had often urged him to rid himself of <lb/>
            Neoptolemus and not be satisfied with a mere share of the <lb/>
            crown, but to engage in the great designs which his <lb/>
            genius prompted. These considerations, together with <lb/>
            the suspicions which he had of Neoptolemus's treachery, <lb/>
            induced him to be beforehand with him by putting him <lb/>
            to death.</p>
          <p>VL In memory of Berenike and Ptolemy he named a boy <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            who was now born to him Ptolemy, and gave the name of Be­ <lb/>
            renike to a city which he foundedon the peninsula of Epirus. <lb/>
            lie now began to revolve great designs, casting his eyes <lb/>
            especially upon the territory of his neighbours; and he <lb/>
            was soon enabled to interfere in the affairs of Macedonia on <lb/>
            the following grounds. The elder of the sons of Kassander <lb/>
            put his mother, Thessalonika, to death, and drove his <lb/>
            younger brother Alexander into exile. This prince now <lb/>
            applied both to Demetrius and to Pyrrhus for aid. Deme­ <lb/>
            trius was engaged in other matters and was slow to render <lb/>
            him any assistance, but Pyrrhus offered his services, de­ <lb/>
            manding as the price of his assistance the districts called <lb/>
            Stymphæa and Paransea in Macedon itself, and of the <lb/>
            Macedonian conquests Ambrakia, Akarnania, and Amphilo­ <lb/>
            chia. The youth agreed to these terms, and Pyrrhus at once <lb/>
            occupied those countries, which he secured by garrisoning <lb/>
            their fortresses, while he began to press Antipater hard in <lb/>
            his endeavours to gain the remainder of Macedonia for his <lb/>
            brother. At this time king Lysimachus, an eager partisan <lb/>
            of Antipater, was too much occupied with other matters to <lb/>
            send him any material help, but, knowing that Pyrrhus <lb/>
            would never disoblige or thwart Ptolemy in anything, sent <lb/>
            a forged letter to him, in which it was stated to be Ptolemy's <lb/>
            desire that he should withdraw his forces on the receipt of <lb/>
            three hundred talents from Antipater. Pyrrhus, however, <lb/>
            as soon as he opened the letter saw the deceit; for it did <lb/>
            not begin with Ptolemy's usual greeting to him, “ The <lb/>
            father to the son wishes health " but “ King Ptolemy to <lb/>
            king Pyrrhus wishes health." He reproached Lysimachus <lb/>
            for his conduct, but nevertheless made a peace, which they <lb/>
            all met to ratify by a solemn oath upon a sacrifice. A <lb/>
            bull, a boar, and a ram were brought to the altar, when <lb/>
            suddenly the ram fell down dead. The others laughed at <lb/>
            this, but the soothsayer Theodotus, who was conducting the <lb/>
            sacrifice forbad Pyrrhus to swear, saying that Heaven by <lb/>
            this portended the death of one of the three kings who <lb/>
            were there met together. Pyrrhus therefore refused to <lb/>
            ratify the peace.</p>
          <p>VII. Alexander now was in a fair way to succeed, when <lb/>
            he was joined l:y Demetrius, who was evidently unwelcome, <lb/>
            and a dangerous ally. Before many days had passed the <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            two princes, from mutual distrust, began to plot against <lb/>
            each other. Demetrius, seizing his opportunity, assassin­ <lb/>
            ated the youthful Alexander, and proclaimed himself king <lb/>
            of Macedonia. He had before this been on bad terms with <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, who had made incursions into Thessaly, and the <lb/>
            usual disease of princes, grasping covetousness, had made <lb/>
            them suspicious and quarrelsome neighbours, especially <lb/>
            since the death of Deidameia. Now, however, as they both <lb/>
            claimed Macedonia, they were brought into direct collision, <lb/>
            and Demetrius, after making a campaign in Ætolia and <lb/>
            leaving Pantauchus with a large force to guard his con­ <lb/>
            quests there, himself marched against Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            as soon as he heard of this, proceeded to meet him, but by <lb/>
            a mistake in the road they passed by one another, so that <lb/>
            Demetrius invaded Epirus and ravaged the country there, <lb/>
            and Pyrrhus, falling in with Pantauchus, fought a battle <lb/>
            with him. The struggle was a long and severe one, espe­ <lb/>
            cially near where the generals fought, for Pantauchus, <lb/>
            who was admitted to be the strongest and bravest of the <lb/>
            generals of Demetrius, in the pride of his heart challenged <lb/>
            Pyrrhus to a single combat, while Pyrrhus, who yielded to <lb/>
            none of the kings of the age in strength and courage, and <lb/>
            who wished to be thought a true son of Achilles by valour <lb/>
            as well as by descent, rushed forward beyond the front ranks <lb/>
            to meet Pantauchus. They fought with spears at first, <lb/>
            and then, drawing their swords, contended hand to hand <lb/>
            with equal skill and courage. Pyrrhus received one hurt, <lb/>
            but he wounded Pantauchus in the thigh and in the throat, <lb/>
            and overthrew him. Pyrrhus did not slay him, however, <lb/>
            as he was rescued by his friends, The Epirots, elated at <lb/>
            their king's victory, and filled with enthusiasm by his <lb/>
            courage, bore everything before them, routed the phalanx <lb/>
            of the Macedonians, and pursued the fugitives, of whom <lb/>
            they slew many and took five thousand prisoners.</p>
          <p>VIII. The Macedonians who had witnessed the exploits <lb/>
            of Pyrrhus were struck with admiration, and perhaps <lb/>
            found some solace for their defeat in the praises they be­ <lb/>
            stowed on the conqueror. He was, they said, indeed a <lb/>
            soldier, worthy to command soldiers; the only king of the <lb/>
            age in whom there could be traced any likeness to the <lb/>
            great Alexander. Pyrrhus revived this image by the fire <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            and vigour of his movements in the field of battle; the <lb/>
            rest only mimicked the hero, whose title they assumed, in <lb/>
            their demeanour, and in the trappings and state of royalty.* <lb/>
            We can form an opinion about his knowledge and skill in <lb/>
            military matters from the writings which he has left on <lb/>
            these subjects. It is related, moreover, that Antigonus, <lb/>
            when asked who was the greatest of generals, answered <lb/>
            “ Pyrrhus, if he lives to be old," speaking only of the <lb/>
            generals of his own time. Hannibal, however, considered <lb/>
            Pyrrhus to have been the first general that ever lived for <lb/>
            skill and resource, placing Scipio next, and himself third, <lb/>
            as is written in the Life of Scipio. Indeed Pyrrhus devoted <lb/>
            the whole of his intellect to the art of war, regarding it as <lb/>
            the only study fit for a king, and holding all other occu­ <lb/>
            pations to be frivolous. At a wine party he was once asked <lb/>
            whether he thought Python or Kaphisias the better flute <lb/>
            player, to which he answered that Polysperchon was the <lb/>
            best general, as though that were the only subject on <lb/>
            which a king should form or express an opinion. Yet he <lb/>
            was mild-tempered and gentle towards his friends, full of <lb/>
            gratitude for kindness, and eager to repay it. He grieved <lb/>
            greatly over the death of Aeropus; not so much because <lb/>
            he was dead, for that, he said, was the common lot of man­ <lb/>
            kind, but because he himself had delayed repaying him a <lb/>
            kindness until it was too late. Debts of money, he said, <lb/>
            can be paid to the heirs of a creditor, but men of honour <lb/>
            are grieved at not being able to return a kindness dur­ <lb/>
            ing the lifetime of their benefactor. In Ambrakia once <lb/>
            Pyrrhus was advised to banish a man who abused him in <lb/>
            scurrilous terms. He answered, “I had rather he re­ <lb/>
            mained where he is and abused me there, than that he <lb/>
            should wander through all the world doing so." Once some <lb/>
            youths spoke ill of him over their wine, and being detected <lb/>
            were asked by him whether they had used such words of <lb/>
            him. “We did, 0 king," answered one of the young men, <lb/>
            “and we should have said more evil of you if we Lad had <lb/>
            more wine." At this answer Pyrrhus laughed, and acquitted <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>IX. After the death of Antigone he married several <lb/>
            wives, for the sake of advantageous political alliances <note type="footnote"> *See Thirlwall's ‘History of Greece,' chap. ii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            One was the daughter of Autoleon, king of the Pæonians ; <lb/>
            another was Birkenna, daughter of Bardyllis, king of the <lb/>
            Illyrians, while the third, Lanassa, daughter of Agathokles, <lb/>
            despot of Syracuse, brought him as a dowry the city and <lb/>
            island of Korkyra, which had been captured by Agathokles. <lb/>
            By Antigone no had already one son, Ptolemy; by <lb/>
            Lanassa he had another son, Alexander, and Helenus, the <lb/>
            youngest of his sons, by Birkenna. They were all brought <lb/>
            up to be good soldiers, being trained in arms by Pyrrhus <lb/>
            himself. It is said that when one of his sons, while yet a <lb/>
            child, asked him to which of them he would leave his king­ <lb/>
            dom, he answered “To him whose sword is the sharpest." <lb/>
            This saying differs but little from that celebrated tragic <lb/>
            curse upon the brothers who were to " divide their heritage <lb/>
            with whetted steel.” So savage and unsocial a quality is <lb/>
            ambition.</p>
          <p>X. After this battle Pyrrhus returned home, delighted <lb/>
            at the glory which he had acquired. When the Epirotes <lb/>
            gave him the title of the Eagle, he answered " I owe it <lb/>
            to you that I am an eagle, for it is your arms that enable <lb/>
            me to take so high a flight." Shortly afterwards, learning <lb/>
            that Demetrius was dangerously ill, he suddenly invaded <lb/>
            Macedonia, meaning merely to make a short incur­ <lb/>
            sion, but he very nearly obtained possession of the entire <lb/>
            kingdom, as he overran the country without opposition <lb/>
            and marched as far as Edessa, while many of the natives <lb/>
            assisted him and joined his army. The danger roused <lb/>
            Demetrius from his sick bed, and his partisans hastily <lb/>
            collected a considerable force and marched to attack <lb/>
            Pyrrhus. As he had only come with the intention of <lb/>
            plundering he avoided giving battle and retreated, but on <lb/>
            his way lost a part of his army by an attack of the <lb/>
            Macedonians.</p>
          <p>Demetrius, though he had thus easily driven Pyrrhus <lb/>
            out of his kingdom, did not despise him. He had deter­ <lb/>
            mined to go to war on a great scale to recover his father's <lb/>
            throne, with a force of a hundred thousand men and five <lb/>
            hundred ships of war ; and he did not wish to be thwarted <lb/>
            in this design by Pyrrhus, or to leave him as a fierce and <lb/>
            dangerous neighbour for Macedonia. Consequently, as he <lb/>
            had no leisure to go to war with him, he wished to come <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            to terms with him and make peace, so that he might be at <lb/>
            liberty to attack the other kings. These considerations led <lb/>
            him to conclude a truce with Pyrrhus. However, the great­ <lb/>
            ness of the force at Demetrius's disposal now led him to <lb/>
            assume such an arrogant tone that the other kings were <lb/>
            alarmed and sent letters to Pyrrhus in which they expressed <lb/>
            their surprise that he should overlook the magnificent <lb/>
            opportunity which Demetrius would offer him by engag­ <lb/>
            ing in a foreign war, and asked him whether, when he <lb/>
            was able to drive that restless intriguer out of Macedonia, <lb/>
            he intended not to do so, but to sit idle at home while <lb/>
            Demetrius gained wealth and power, until at length he <lb/>
            would have to fight for his hearth and home in Molossia, <lb/>
            and that too when Demetrius had just deprived him of <lb/>
            Korkyra by means of his wife. For Lanassa had quarrelled <lb/>
            with Pyrrhus because he paid too much attention to his <lb/>
            barbarian wives, had retired to Korkyra, and, as she still <lb/>
            wished to be a queen, invited Demetrius to take possession <lb/>
            of her person and of the island. He at once proceeded <lb/>
            thither, married Lanassa, and placed a garrison in the city.</p>
          <p>XI. Besides writing to Pyrrhus in this strain the kings <lb/>
            themselves contrived to find work for Demetrius, who was <lb/>
            still engaged in preparations for his campaign. Ptolemy <lb/>
            sailed to Greece with a large force and induced many of <lb/>
            the Greek cities to revolt from Demetrius, while Lysima­ <lb/>
            chus, starting from Thrace, invaded and plundered Upper <lb/>
            Macedonia. At the same time Pyrrhus marched upon the <lb/>
            city of Berœa, truly conjecturing that Demetrius, in his <lb/>
            haste to repel the invasion of Upper Macedonia, would <lb/>
            leave the lower part of the country unprotected. That <lb/>
            night he dreamed that he was called by Alexander the <lb/>
            Great, and that he at once went to him, and found him <lb/>
            reclining on a couch. The hero received him kindly, and <lb/>
            promised him that he would aid him. When Pyrrhus <lb/>
            mustered courage to ask, "How, 0 king, being yourself <lb/>
            ill, can you assist me " ? Alexander answered, “ With my <lb/>
            name," and mounting a Nisæan horse appeared to lead <lb/>
            the way. This dream gave Pyrrhus great confidence: he <lb/>
            quickly marched over the intervening country and took <lb/>
            Berœa, where he fixed his head-quarters, and sent out <lb/>
            detachments to reduce other places. Demetrius, when ho <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            heard this news, and heard also the tumult of grief and in­ <lb/>
            dignation which it excited in his camp, feared to march any <lb/>
            closer to Lysimachus, lest if his army came near to a king <lb/>
            who was a Macedonian, and so distinguished a man, the <lb/>
            troops might transfer their allegiance to him. He there­ <lb/>
            fore resolved to retrace his steps, and attack Pyrrhus, as <lb/>
            being a foreigner, and an enemy of the Macedonians. How­ <lb/>
            ever, when he pitched his camp near Berœa, many came out <lb/>
            from that city loudly praising Pyrrhus, as an invincible <lb/>
            warrior and a great man, who had treated the vanquished <lb/>
            with kindness and magnanimity. Some of these were <lb/>
            emissaries of Pyrrhus himself, disguised as Macedonians, <lb/>
            who said that now was the time for them to relieve them­ <lb/>
            selves from the harsh tyranny of Demetrius by adopting <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, a popular man and a true friend of the soldier, <lb/>
            as their king. The greater part of Demetrius's troops was <lb/>
            much excited by this means, and when the two armies met <lb/>
            face to face, all eyes were turned in search of the hero. <lb/>
            For a time they could not find him, for he had taken off <lb/>
            his helmet; but when he had put it on again, and enabled <lb/>
            them to recognise him by the lofty crest, and the goat's <lb/>
            horns at the sides, the Macedonian soldiers quitted their <lb/>
            ranks, and came running up to ask him, as their chief, for <lb/>
            the pass-word. Others, seeing that his attendants wore <lb/>
            garlands of oak-leaves, crowned themselves in like manner. <lb/>
            Some already ventured to tell Demetrius that his best <lb/>
            course would be to give up all as lost: and he, observing, <lb/>
            that this advice seemed to be borne out by the temper of <lb/>
            his army, withdrew in terror, disguised in a mean dress, <lb/>
            and a broad-brimmed Macedonian hat. Pyrrhus, advancing <lb/>
            without striking a blow, obtained possession of his enemy's <lb/>
            camp, and was saluted king of the Macedonians.</p>
          <p>XII. Lysimachus soon appeared upon the scene, pointed <lb/>
            out that the fall of Demetrius was as much due to his own <lb/>
            exertions as to those of Pyrrhus, and demanded a partition <lb/>
            of Macedonia. To this Pyrrhus, not yet certain of the <lb/>
            loyalty of his new subjects, was obliged to consent. This <lb/>
            measure was beneficial for the moment, as it prevented <lb/>
            their going to war; but soon it became apparent that the <lb/>
            partition was a source of endless quarrels and recrimina­ <lb/>
            tions. For when men are ambitious to such a degree <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            that no seas, mountains, or wildernesses, nay not even the <lb/>
            boundaries of Europe and Asia, will serve as barriers to <lb/>
            their frantic desire for more territory, it is not to be <lb/>
            expected that they will remain quiet when their frontiers <lb/>
            touch one another, but they always are at war, from the <lb/>
            natural jealousy of their disposition. The names of peace <lb/>
            and war they use as mere symbols, as it suits their con­ <lb/>
            venience, and they are really better men when they are <lb/>
            openly at war than when they give the name of peace and <lb/>
            friendship to a cessation of active wickedness. The truth <lb/>
            of this was proved by Pyrrhus, who in order to prevent <lb/>
            Demetrius from recovering from the great disaster which <lb/>
            he had sustained, espoused the cause of Greece, and <lb/>
            marched to Athens. Here he went up to the Acropolis <lb/>
            and sacrificed to the goddess Athena. On descending he <lb/>
            thanked the Athenians for their confidence in him, but <lb/>
            advised them if they consulted their own interest never <lb/>
            to admit any king within their walls.* After this he made <lb/>
            peace with Demetrius, but shortly after he was gone to <lb/>
            Asia, Pyrrhus, at the instigation of Lysimachus, induced <lb/>
            the Thessalians to revolt and join him, and began to <lb/>
            besiege the fortresses on the Greek border, both because <lb/>
            he found the Macedonians easier to manage when they <lb/>
            were at war than when they were idle, and also because <lb/>
            he himself was of a nature which could not endure <lb/>
            inaction. Finally however Demetrius was irretrievably <lb/>
            ruined in Syria, and now Lysimachus, having nothing <lb/>
            further to fear from him, at once attacked Pyrrhus. He <lb/>
            fell upon him suddenly near Edessa, defeated him, and <lb/>
            reduced the troops under him to great distress for pro­ <lb/>
            visions. Next he began to corrupt the leading Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, reproaching them with having rejected a <lb/>
            Macedonian who had been the friend and companion <lb/>
            of Alexander, and chosen in his stead as their master a <lb/>
            foreigner, and one, too, of a race that had always been sub­ <lb/>
            ject to the Macedonians. As many listened to these trea­ <lb/>
            cherous insinuations, Pyrrhus became alarmed, and with­ <lb/>
            drew with his Epirotes and the allied troops, thus losing <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch's account of these transactions is hardly intelligible. <lb/>
            Demetrius, it appears, was about to lay siege to Athens when Pyrrhus <lb/>
            prevented him. See Thirlwall's History, chap. IX. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            Macedonia in the same way that he had gained it. So that <lb/>
            kings have but little reason for reproaching the common <lb/>
            people for changing sides in an emergency, for in doing so <lb/>
            they do but imitate the kings themselves, their teachers in <lb/>
            the art of treachery and faithlessness, who think that those <lb/>
            tHen gain the greatest advantages who take least account <lb/>
            of justice and honour.</p>
          <p>XIII. Pyrrhus, now that he had lost Macedonia, might <lb/>
            have spent his days peacefully ruling his own subjects in <lb/>
            Epirus; but he could not endure repose, thinking that <lb/>
            not to trouble others and be troubled by them was a <lb/>
            life of unbearable ennui, and, like Achilles in the Iliad, <lb/>
            “he could not rest in indolence at home, <lb/>
            He longed for battle, and the joys of war."</p>
          <p>As he desired some new adventures he embraced the <lb/>
            following opportunity. The Romans were at war with <lb/>
            the Tarentines; and as that people were not sufficiently <lb/>
            powerful to carry on the war, and yet were not allowed <lb/>
            by the audacious folly of their mob orators to make peace, <lb/>
            they proposed to make Pyrrhus their leader and to invite <lb/>
            him to be their ally in the war, because he was more at <lb/>
            leisure than any of the other kings, and also was the best <lb/>
            general of them all. Of the older and more sensible <lb/>
            citizens some endeavoured to oppose this fatal decision, <lb/>
            but were overwhelmed by the clamour of the war party, <lb/>
            while the rest, observing this, ceased to attend the public <lb/>
            assembly. There was one citizen of good repute, named <lb/>
            Meton, who, on the day when the final decision was to <lb/>
            be made, when the people were all assembled, took a <lb/>
            withered garland and a torch, like a drunkard, and reeled <lb/>
            into the assembly with a girl playing the flute before him. <lb/>
            At this, as one may expect in a disorderly popular meeting, <lb/>
            some applauded, and some laughed, but no one stopped <lb/>
            him. They next bade the girl play, and Melon come <lb/>
            forward and dance to the music ; and he made as though <lb/>
            he would do so. When he had obtained silence he said <lb/>
            “Men of Tarentum, you do well in encouraging those who <lb/>
            wish to be merry and amuse themselves while they may. <lb/>
            If you are wise you will all enjoy your freedom now, for <lb/>
            when Pyrrhus is come to our city you will have very <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            different things to think of, and will live very differ­ <lb/>
            ently." By these words he made an impression on <lb/>
            the mass of the Tarentine people, and a murmur ran <lb/>
            through the crowd that he had spoken well. But those <lb/>
            politicians who feared that if peace were made they should <lb/>
            be delivered up to the Romans, reproached the people for <lb/>
            allowing any one to insult them by such a disgraceful <lb/>
            exhibition, and prevailed on them to turn Meton out of <lb/>
            the assembly. Thus the vote for war was passed, and <lb/>
            ambassadors were sent to Epirus, not from Tarentum alone, <lb/>
            but from the other Greek cities in Italy, carrying with <lb/>
            them presents for Pyrrhus, with instructions to tell him <lb/>
            that they required a leader of skill and renown, and <lb/>
            that they possessed a force of Lucanians, Messapians, <lb/>
            Samnites and Tarentines, which amounted to twenty <lb/>
            thousand cavalry, and three hundred and fifty thousand <lb/>
            infantry. This not only excited Pyrrhus, but also made <lb/>
            all the Epirotes eager to take part in the campaign.</p>
          <p>XIV. There was one Kineas, a Thessalian, who was <lb/>
            thought to be a man of good sense, and who, having heard <lb/>
            Demosthenes the orator speak, was better able than any <lb/>
            of the speakers of his age to delight his hearers with an <lb/>
            imitation of the eloquence of that great master of rhetoric. <lb/>
            He was now in the service of Pyrrhus, and being sent <lb/>
            about to various cities, proved the truth of the Euripidean <lb/>
            saw, that <lb/>
            “All can be done by words <lb/>
            Which foemen wish to do with conquering swords." <lb/>
            Pyrrhus at any rate used to say that more cities were won <lb/>
            for him by Kineas with words, than he himself won by <lb/>
            force of arms. This man, observing that Pyrrhus was <lb/>
            eagerly preparing for his Italian expedition, once when <lb/>
            he was at leisure conversed with him in the following <lb/>
            manner. " Pyrrhus," said he, " the Romans are said to <lb/>
            be good soldiers, and to rule over many warlike nations. <lb/>
            Now, if heaven grants us the victory over them, what use <lb/>
            shall we make of it ? "</p>
          <p>" You ask what is self-evident," answered Pyrrhus. " If <lb/>
            we can conquer the Romans, there is no city, Greek or <lb/>
            barbarian, that can resist us, and we shall gain possession <note type="footnote"> VOL II. </note> <note type="footnote"> 0 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            of the whole of Italy, a country whose size, richness, and <lb/>
            power no one knows better than yourself." Kineas then, <lb/>
            after waiting for a short time, said, “ 0 king, when we <lb/>
            have taken Italy, what shall we do then ? ”Pyrrhus, not <lb/>
            yet seeing his drift, answered, " Close to it Sicily invites <lb/>
            us, a noble and populous island, and one which is very <lb/>
            easy to conquer; for, my Kineas, now that Agathokles is <lb/>
            dead, there is nothing there but revolution and faction, <lb/>
            and the violence of party spirit." " What you say," <lb/>
            answered Kineas, "is very probably true. But is this <lb/>
            conquest of Sicily to be the extreme limit of our cam­ <lb/>
            paign ? " “ Heaven," answered Pyrrhus, alone can give <lb/>
            us victory and success ; but these conquests would merely <lb/>
            prove to us the stepping-stones to greater things. Who <lb/>
            could refrain from making an attempt upon Carthage and <lb/>
            Libya when he was so close to them, countries which were <lb/>
            all but conquered by Agathokles when he ran away from <lb/>
            Syracuse with only a few ships ? and if we were masters <lb/>
            of these countries, none of the enemies who now give <lb/>
            themselves such airs at our expense will dare to resist ua." <lb/>
            “Certainly not," answered Kineas; “with such a force at <lb/>
            our disposal we clearly could recover Macedonia, and have <lb/>
            the whole of Greece at our feet. And after we have made <lb/>
            all these conquests, what shall we do then ? " Pyrrhus <lb/>
            laughing answered, “We will take our ease and carouse <lb/>
            every day, and enjoy pleasant conversation with one <lb/>
            another." Having brought Pyrrhus to say this, Kineas <lb/>
            asked in reply, “But what prevents our carousing and <lb/>
            taking our ease now, since we have already at hand all <lb/>
            those things which we propose to obtain with much blood­ <lb/>
            shed, and great toils and perils, and after suffering much <lb/>
            ourselves and causing much suffering to others?" By <lb/>
            talking in this manner Kineas vexed Pyrrhus, because he <lb/>
            made him reflect on the pleasant home which he was <lb/>
            leaving, but his reasoning had no effect in turning him <lb/>
            from his purpose.</p>
          <p>XV. He first despatched Kineas to Tarentum with three <lb/>
            thousand men; next he collected from Tarentum many <lb/>
            horse-transports, decked vessels, and boats of all sorts, and <lb/>
            embarked upon them twenty elephants, twenty-three <lb/>
            thousand cavalry, twenty-two thousand infantry, and five <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            hundred slingers. When all was ready he put to sea; and <lb/>
            when half way across a storm burst upon him from the <lb/>
            north, which was unusual at that season of the year. He <lb/>
            himself, though his ship was carried away by the tempest, <lb/>
            yet, by the great pains and skill of the sailors and pilots, <lb/>
            resisted it and reached the land, with great toil to the <lb/>
            rowers, and beyond everyone's expectation; for the rest <lb/>
            of the fleet was overpowered by the gale and scattered. <lb/>
            Some ships were driven off the Italian coast altogether, and <lb/>
            forced into the Libyan and Sicilian seas, and some which <lb/>
            could not weather the Iapygian Cape were overtaken by <lb/>
            night, and being dashed by a violent and boisterous sea <lb/>
            against that harbourless coast were utterly lost, except only <lb/>
            the king's ship. She was so large and strongly built as to <lb/>
            resist the waves as long as they broke upon her from the sea­ <lb/>
            ward ; but when the wind changed and blew directly off <lb/>
            the shore, the ship, which now met the waves directly <lb/>
            with her head, was in great danger of going to pieces, <lb/>
            while to let her drive out to sea again now that it was so <lb/>
            rough, and the wind changed so frequently, seemed more <lb/>
            terrible than to remain where they were. Pyrrhus rose <lb/>
            and leapt into the water, and at once was eagerly followed <lb/>
            by his friends and his bodyguard. The darkness of night <lb/>
            and the violent recoil of the roaring waves made it hard <lb/>
            for them to help him, and it was not until daybreak, <lb/>
            when the wind abated, that he reached the land, faint and <lb/>
            helpless in body, but with his spirit invincible in mis­ <lb/>
            fortune. The Messapians, upon whose coast he had been <lb/>
            thrown, now assembled from the neighbouring villages <lb/>
            and offered their help, while some of the ships which had <lb/>
            outlived the storm appeared, bringing a few horsemen, <lb/>
            about two thousand foot, and two elephants.</p>
          <p>XVI. With these Pyrrhus marched to Tarentum; <lb/>
            Kineas, as soon as he heard of his arrival, bringing out <lb/>
            the Tarentine army to meet him. When he reached the <lb/>
            city he did nothing to displease the Tarentines until his <lb/>
            fleet returned to the coast and he had assembled the greater <lb/>
            part of his army. But then, as he saw that the populace, <lb/>
            unless ruled by a strong hand, could neither help him nor <lb/>
            help themselves, but intended to stay idling about their <lb/>
            baths and entertainments at home, while he fought their <note type="footnote"> o 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            battles in the field, he closed the gymnasia and public <lb/>
            walks, in which the people were wont to waste their <lb/>
            time in empty talk about the war. He forbade all drink­ <lb/>
            ing, feasting, and unseasonable revels, and forced the <lb/>
            people to take up arms, proving himself inexorable to <lb/>
            every one who was on the muster-roll of able-bodied <lb/>
            citizens. This conduct made him much disliked, and many <lb/>
            of the TareD tines left the city in disgust; for they were <lb/>
            so unused to discipline, that they considered that not to be <lb/>
            able to pass their lives as they chose was no better than <lb/>
            slavery.</p>
          <p>When news came that Laevinus, the Roman consul, was <lb/>
            marching to attack him with a large force, and was <lb/>
            plundering the country of Lucania as he advanced, while <lb/>
            Pyrrhus's allies had not yet arrived, he thought it a <lb/>
            shameful thing to allow the enemy to proceed any farther, <lb/>
            and marched out with his army. He sent before him a <lb/>
            herald to the Roman general, informing him that he was <lb/>
            willing to act as arbitrator in the dispute between the <lb/>
            Romans and the Greek cities of Italy, if they chose to ter­ <lb/>
            minate it peacefully. On receiving for an answer that <lb/>
            the Romans neither wished for Pyrrhus as an arbitrator, <lb/>
            nor feared him as an enemy, he marched forward, and en­ <lb/>
            camped in the plain, between the city of Pandosia and <lb/>
            Heraklea. Learning that the Romans were close by, and <lb/>
            were encamping on the farther side of the river Siris * he <lb/>
            rode up to the river to view them; and when he observed <lb/>
            their even ranks, their orderly movements, and their well­ <lb/>
            arranged camp, he was surprised, and said to the nearest <lb/>
            of his friends: " These barbarians, Megakles, have nothing <lb/>
            barbarous in their military discipline ; but we shall soon <lb/>
            learn what they can do." He began indeed already to <lb/>
            feel some uncertainty as to the issue of the campaign, and <lb/>
            determined to wait until his allies came up, and till then <lb/>
            to observe the movements of the Romans, and prevent <lb/>
            their crossing the river. They however, perceiving his <lb/>
            object, at once crossed the river, the infantry at a ford, the <lb/>
            cavalry at many points at once, so that the Greeks feared <lb/>
            they might be surrounded, and drew back. Pyrrhus, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving this, ordered his officers instantly to form the <note type="footnote"> * The river Aciris, now called Agri. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            troops in order of battle and wait under arms while he <lb/>
            himself charged with the cavalry, three thousand strong, <lb/>
            hoping to catch the Romans in the act of crossing the <lb/>
            river and consequently in disorder. When he saw many <lb/>
            shields of the Roman infantry appearing over the river <lb/>
            bank, and their horsemen all ranged in order, he closed up <lb/>
            his own ranks and charged them first himself, a conspicu­ <lb/>
            ous figure in his beautiful glittering armour, and proving <lb/>
            by his exploits that he deserved his high reputation; <lb/>
            especially as, although he fought personally, and engaged <lb/>
            in combat with the enemy, yet he continually watched the <lb/>
            whole battle, and handled his troops with as much facility <lb/>
            as though he were not in the thick of the fight, appear­ <lb/>
            ing always wherever his presence was required, and rein­ <lb/>
            forcing those who seemed likely to give way. In this battle <lb/>
            Leonnatus the Macedonian observing one of the Italians <lb/>
            watching Pyrrhus and constantly following him about the <lb/>
            field, said to him, " My king, do you see that barbarian on <lb/>
            the black horse with white feet ? He seems to be meditat­ <lb/>
            ing some desperate deed. He is a man of spirit and courage, <lb/>
            and he never takes his eyes off you, and takes no notice of <lb/>
            any one else. Beware of that man." Pyrrhus answered, <lb/>
            “Leonnatus, no man can avoid his fate; but neither that <lb/>
            Italian nor any one else who attacks me will do so with <lb/>
            impunity." While they were yet talking the Italian <lb/>
            levelled his lance, and urged his horse in full career against <lb/>
            Pyrrhus. He struck the king's horse with his spear, <lb/>
            and at the same instant his own horse was struck a <lb/>
            sidelong blow by Leonnatus. Both horses fell; Pyrrhus <lb/>
            was saved by his friends, and the Italian perished fighting. <lb/>
            He was of the nation of the Frentani, Hoplacus by name, <lb/>
            and was the captain of a troop of horse.</p>
          <p>XVII. This incident taught Pyrrhus to be more cautious. <lb/>
            He observed that his cavalry were inclined to give way, <lb/>
            and therefore sent for his phalanx, and arrayed it against <lb/>
            the enemy. Then he gave his cloak and armour to one <lb/>
            of his companions, Megakles, and after partially disguis­ <lb/>
            ing himself in those of his friend, led his main body to <lb/>
            attack the Roman army. The Romans stoutly resisted <lb/>
            him, and an obstinate battle took place, for it is said that <lb/>
            the combatants alternately yielded and again pressed <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            forward no less than seven distinct times. The king's <lb/>
            exchange of armour too, though it saved his life, yet very <lb/>
            nearly lost him the victory : for many attacked Megakles, <lb/>
            and the man who first struck him down, who was named <lb/>
            Decius, snatched up his cloak and helmet, and rode with <lb/>
            them to Laevinus, displaying them and shouting aloud <lb/>
            that he had slain Pyrrhus. The Romans, when they saw <lb/>
            these spoils carried in triumph along their ranks, raised <lb/>
            a joyful cry, while the Greeks were correspondingly dis­ <lb/>
            heartened until Pyrrhus, learning what had taken place, <lb/>
            rode along the line with his head bare, stretching out his <lb/>
            hands to his soldiers and telling them that he was safe. <lb/>
            At length he was victorious, chiefly by means of a sudden <lb/>
            charge of his Thessalian horse on the Romans after they <lb/>
            had been thrown into disorder by the advance of the <lb/>
            elephants. The Roman horses were terrified at these <lb/>
            animals, and long before they came near, ran away with <lb/>
            their riders in panic. The slaughter was very great: <lb/>
            Dionysius says that of the Romans there fell but little short <lb/>
            of fifteen thousand, but Hieronymus reduces this to seven <lb/>
            thousand, while on Pyrrhus's side there fell, according to <lb/>
            Dionysius, thirteen thousand, but according to Hieronymus <lb/>
            less than four thousand. These however, were the very <lb/>
            flower of Pyrrhus's army; for he lost all his most trusty <lb/>
            officers, and his most intimate personal friends. Still, he <lb/>
            captured the Roman camp, which was abandoned by the <lb/>
            enemy, induced several of their allied cities to join him, <lb/>
            plundered a vast extent of country, and advanced within <lb/>
            three hundred stades (less than forty English miles) of <lb/>
            Rome itself. After the battle many of the Lucanians and <lb/>
            Samnites came up; these allies he reproached for their <lb/>
            dilatory movements, but was evidently well pleased at <lb/>
            having conquered the great Roman army with no other <lb/>
            forces but his own Epirotes and the Tarentines.</p>
          <p>XVIII. The Romans did not remove Laevinus from his <lb/>
            office of consul, although Caius Fabricius is reported to <lb/>
            have said that it was not the Epirotes who had conquered <lb/>
            the Romans, but Pyrrhus who had conquered Laevinus; <lb/>
            meaning that he thought that the defeat was owing not <lb/>
            to the greater force but the superior generalship of the <lb/>
            enemy. They astonished Pyrrhus by quickly filling up <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            their ranks with fresh levies, and talking about the war <lb/>
            in a spirit of fearless confidence. He decided to try <lb/>
            whether they were disposed to make terms with him, as <lb/>
            he perceived that to capture Rome and utterly subdue <lb/>
            the Roman people would be a work of no small difficulty, <lb/>
            and that it would be vain to attempt it with the force at <lb/>
            his disposal, while after his victory he could make peace <lb/>
            on terms which would reflect great lustre on himself. <lb/>
            Kineas was sent as ambassador to conduct this negotia­ <lb/>
            tion. He conversed with the leading men of Rome, and <lb/>
            offered their wives and children presents from the king. <lb/>
            No one, however, would accept them, but they all, men <lb/>
            and women alike, replied that, if peace were publicly <lb/>
            concluded with the king, they would then have no ob­ <lb/>
            jection to regard him as a friend. And when Kineas <lb/>
            spoke before the Senate in a winning and persuasive <lb/>
            manner he could not make any impression upon his <lb/>
            audience, although he announced to them that Pyrrhus <lb/>
            would restore the prisoners he had taken without any <lb/>
            ransom, and would assist them in subduing all Italy, <lb/>
            while all that he asked in return was that he should be <lb/>
            regarded as a friend, and that the people of Tarentum <lb/>
            should not be molested. The common people, however, <lb/>
            were evidently eager for peace, in consequence of their <lb/>
            having been defeated in one great battle, and expecting <lb/>
            that they would have to fight another against a larger <lb/>
            force, because the Italian states would join Pyrrhus. At <lb/>
            this crisis Appius Claudius, an illustrious man, but who <lb/>
            had long since been prevented by old age and blindness <lb/>
            from taking any active part in politics, when he heard <lb/>
            of the proposals of Pyrrhus, and that the question of <lb/>
            peace or war was about to be voted upon by the Senate, <lb/>
            could no longer endure to remain at home, but caused his <lb/>
            slaves to carry him through the Forum to the Senate House <lb/>
            in a litter. When he reached the doors of the Senate <lb/>
            House his sons and sons-in-law supported him and guided <lb/>
            him into the house, while all the assembly observed a <lb/>
            respectful silence.</p>
          <p>XIX. Speaking from where he stood, he addressed them <lb/>
            as follows :—“ My countrymen, I used to grieve at the loss <lb/>
            of my sight, but now I am sorry not to be deaf also, when <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            I hear the disgraceful propositions with which you are <lb/>
            tarnishing the glory of Rome. What has become of that <lb/>
            boast which we were so fond of making before all man­ <lb/>
            kind, that if Alexander the Great had invaded Italy, and <lb/>
            had met us when we were young, and our fathers when <lb/>
            they were in the prime of life, he would not have been <lb/>
            reputed invincible, but would either have fled or perhaps <lb/>
            even have fallen, and added to the glory of Rome? You <lb/>
            now prove that this was mere empty vapouring, by your <lb/>
            terror of these Chaonians and Molossians, nations who <lb/>
            have always been a prey and a spoil to the Macedonians, <lb/>
            and by your fear of this Pyrrhus, who used formerly to <lb/>
            dance attendance on one of Alexander's bodyguards,* and <lb/>
            who has now wandered hither not so much in order to <lb/>
            assist the Greeks in Italy as to escape from his enemies <lb/>
            at home, and promises to be our friend and protector <lb/>
            forsooth, when the army he commands did not suffice to <lb/>
            keep for him the least portion of that Macedonia which <lb/>
            he once acquired. Do not imagine that you will get rid <lb/>
            of this man by making a treaty with him. Rather you <lb/>
            will encourage other Greek princes to invade you, for <lb/>
            they will despise you and think you an easy prey to all <lb/>
            men, if you let Pyrrhus go home again without paying <lb/>
            the penalty of his outrages upon you, nay, with the power <lb/>
            to boast that he has made Rome a laughing-stock for <lb/>
            Tarentines and Samnites."</p>
          <p>By these words Appius roused a warlike spirit in the <lb/>
            Romans, and they dismissed Kineas with the answer that <lb/>
            if Pyrrhus would leave Italy they would, if he wished, <lb/>
            discuss the question of an alliance with him, but that <lb/>
            while he remained in arms in their country the Romans <lb/>
            would fight him to the death, however many Laevinuses <lb/>
            he might defeat. It is related that Kineas, during his <lb/>
            mission to Rome, took great interest in observing the <lb/>
            national life of the Romans, and fully appreciated the <lb/>
            excellence of their political constitution, which he learned <lb/>
            by conversing with many of the leading men of the state. <lb/>
            On his return he told Pyrrhus that the Senate seemed to <lb/>
            him like an assembly of kings, and that as to the populace, <lb/>
            he feared that the Greeks might find in them a new <note type="footnote"> * Demetrius. </note> <lb/>

            Lemæan hydra; for- twice as many troops had been en­ <lb/>
            rolled in the consul's army as he had before, and yet there <lb/>
            remained many more Romans capable of bearing arms.</p>
          <p>XX. After this Caius Fabricius came to arrange terms <lb/>
            for the exchange of prisoners; a man whom Kineas said <lb/>
            the Romans especially valued for his virtue and bravery, <lb/>
            but who was excessively poor. Pyrrhus, in consequence <lb/>
            of this, entertained Fabricius privately, and made him an <lb/>
            offer of money, not as a bribe for any act of baseness, but <lb/>
            speaking of it as a pledge of friendship and sincerity. As <lb/>
            Fabricius refused this, Pyrrhus waited till the next day, <lb/>
            when, desirous of making an impression on him, as he had <lb/>
            never seen an elephant, he had his largest elephant placed <lb/>
            behind Fabricius during their conference, concealed by a <lb/>
            curtain. At a given signal, the curtain was withdrawn, <lb/>
            and the creature reached out his trunk over the head of <lb/>
            Fabricius with a harsh and terrible cry. Fabricius, how­ <lb/>
            ever, quietly turned round, and then said to Pyrrhus with <lb/>
            a smile, “ You could not move me by your gold yesterday, <lb/>
            nor can you with your beast to-day." At table that day <lb/>
            they conversed upon all subjects, but chiefly about Greece <lb/>
            and Greek philosophy. Kineas repeated the opinion of <lb/>
            Epikurus and his school, about the gods, and the practice <lb/>
            of political life, and the objects at which we should aim, <lb/>
            how they considered pleasure to be the highest good, and <lb/>
            held aloof from taking any active part in politics, because <lb/>
            it spoiled and destroyed perfect happiness; and about how <lb/>
            they thought that the gods lived far removed from hopes <lb/>
            and fears, and interest in human affairs, in a placid state <lb/>
            of eternal fruition.- While he was speaking in this <lb/>
            strain Fabricius burst out: " Hercules! " cried he, " May <lb/>
            Pyrrhus and the Samnites continue to waste their time on <lb/>
            these speculations, as long as they remain at war with <lb/>
            us !” Pyrrhus, at this, was struck by the spirit and noble <note type="footnote"> * I have translated the above passages almost literally from the <lb/>
            Greek. Yet I am inclined to think that Arnold has penetrated the <lb/>
            true meaning, and shows us the reason for Fabricius's exclamation, <lb/>
            when he states the Epicurean philosophy, as expounded by Kineas, to <lb/>
            be “that war and state affairs were but toil and trouble, and that the <lb/>
            wise man should imitate the blissful rest of the gods, who, dwelling in <lb/>
            their own divinity, regarded not the vain turmoil of this lower world.” <lb/>

            disposition of Fabricius, and longed more than ever to <lb/>
            make Rome his friend instead of his enemy. He begged <lb/>
            him to arrange terms of peace, and after they were con­ <lb/>
            cluded to come and live with him as the first of his friends <lb/>
            and officers. Fabricius is said to have quietly answered, <lb/>
            " That, 0 King, will not be to your advantage; for those <lb/>
            who now obey you, and look up to you, if they had any <lb/>
            experience of me, would prefer me to you for their king." <lb/>
            Pyrrhus was not angry at this speech, but spoke to all his <lb/>
            friends about the magnanimous conduct of Fabricius, and <lb/>
            entrusted the prisoners to him alone, on the condition that, <lb/>
            if the Senate refused to make peace, they should be allowed <lb/>
            to embrace their friends, and spend the festival of the <lb/>
            Saturnalia with them, and then be sent back to him. <lb/>
            And they were sent back after the Saturnalia, for the <lb/>
            Senate decreed that any of them who remained behind <lb/>
            should be put to death.</p>
          <p>XXI. After this, when C. Fabricius was consul, a man <lb/>
            came into his camp bringing a letter from King Pyrrhus's <lb/>
            physician, in which he offered to poison the king, if he <lb/>
            could be assured of a suitable reward for his services in <lb/>
            thus bringing the war to an end without a blow. Fabricius, <lb/>
            disgusted at the man's treachery, brought his colleague to <lb/>
            share his views, and in haste sent off a letter to Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            bidding him be on his guard. The letter ran as follows: <lb/>
            " Caius Fabricius and Quintus Æmilius, the Roman consuls, <lb/>
            greet King Pyrrhus. You appear to be a bad judge both <lb/>
            of your friends and of your enemies. You will perceive, <lb/>
            by reading the enclosed letter which has been sent to us, <lb/>
            that you are fighting against good and virtuous men, and <lb/>
            trusting to wicked and treacherous ones. We do not give <lb/>
            you this information out of any love we bear you, but for <lb/>
            fear that we might be charged with having assassinated <lb/>
            you and be thought to have brought the war to a close <lb/>
            by treachery because we could not do so by manhood.”</p>
          <p>Pyrrhus on receiving this letter, and discovering the <lb/>
            plot against his life, punished his physician, and, in <lb/>
            return for the kindness of Fabricius and the Romans, <lb/>
            delivered up their prisoners without ransom, and sent <lb/>
            Kineas a second time to arrange terms of peace. How­ <lb/>
            ever, the Romans refused to receive their prisoners back <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            without ransom, being unwilling either to receive a favour <lb/>
            from their enemy, or to be rewarded for having abstained <lb/>
            from treachery towards him, but set free an equal number <lb/>
            of Tarentines and Samnites, and sent them to him. As <lb/>
            to terms of peace, they refused to entertain the question <lb/>
            unless Pyrrhus first placed his entire armament on board the <lb/>
            ships in which it came, and sailed back to Epirus with it.</p>
          <p>As it was now necessary that Pyrrhus should fight <lb/>
            another battle, he advanced with his army to the city of <lb/>
            Asculum, and attacked the Romans. Here he was forced <lb/>
            to fight on rough ground, near the swampy banks of a <lb/>
            river, where his elephants and cavalry were of no service, <lb/>
            and he was forced to attack with his phalanx. After a <lb/>
            drawn battle, in which many fell, night parted the com­ <lb/>
            batants. Next day Pyrrhus manoeuvred so as to bring <lb/>
            the Romans fairly into the plain, where his elephants <lb/>
            could act upon the enemy'is line. He occupied the rough <lb/>
            ground on either side, placed many archers and slingers <lb/>
            among his elephants, and advanced with his phalanx in <lb/>
            close order and irresistible strength. The Romans, who <lb/>
            were unable on the level ground to practise the bush­ <lb/>
            fighting and skirmishing of the previous day, were coin­ <lb/>
            pelled to attack the phalanx in front. They endeavoured <lb/>
            to force their way through that hedge of spears before the <lb/>
            elephants could come up, and showed marvellous courage <lb/>
            in hacking at the spears with their swords, exposing them­ <lb/>
            selves recklessly, careless of wounds or death. After a <lb/>
            long struggle, it is said that they first gave way at the <lb/>
            point where Pyrrhus was urging on his soldiers in person, <lb/>
            though the defeat was chiefly due to the weight and <lb/>
            crushing charge of the elephants. The Romans could <lb/>
            not find any opportunity in this sort of battle for the <lb/>
            display of their courage, but thought it their duty to <lb/>
            stand aside and save themselves from a useless death, just <lb/>
            as they would have done in the case of a wave of the sea <lb/>
            or an earthquake coming upon them. In the flight to <lb/>
            their camp, which was not far off, Hieronymus says that <lb/>
            six thousand Romans perished, and that in Pyrrhus's <lb/>
            commentaries his loss is stated at three thousand five <lb/>
            hundred and five. Dionysius, on the other hand, does not <lb/>
            admit that there were two battles at Asculum, or that the <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            Romans suffered a defeat, but tells us that they fought the <lb/>
            whole of one day until sunset, and then separated, Pyrrhus <lb/>
            being wounded in the arm by a javelin, and the Samnites <lb/>
            having plundered his baggage. He also states the total <lb/>
            loss on both sides to be above fifteen thousand.-</p>
          <p>The armies separated after the battle, and it is said that <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, when congratulated on his victory by his friends, <lb/>
            said in reply: “If we win one more such victory over the <lb/>
            Romans, we shall be utterly ruined." For a large part of <lb/>
            the force which he had brought with him had perished, <lb/>
            and very nearly all his friends and officers, and there were <lb/>
            no more to send for at home. He saw, too, that his allies <lb/>
            were becoming lukewarm, while the Romans, on the other <lb/>
            hand, filled up the gaps with a never ceasing stream of <lb/>
            fresh recruits, and did not lose confidence by their defeats, <lb/>
            but seemed to gather fresh strength and determination to <lb/>
            go on with the war.</p>
          <p>XXII. While in these difficulties he conceived fresh <lb/>
            hopes of success, and engaged in an enterprise in another <lb/>
            quarter, which was likely to interfere with the prosecution <lb/>
            of his original design. An embassy arrived from Sicily, <lb/>
            offering to place the cities of Agrigentum, Syracuse, and <lb/>
            Leontini in his hands, and begging him to aid them in <lb/>
            driving out the Carthaginians from the island, and freeing <lb/>
            it from despots, while at the same time messengers came <lb/>
            from Greece with the news that Ptolemy, surnamed <lb/>
            Keraunus, or " the thunderbolt," had perished, with all <lb/>
            his army, in an engagement with the Gauls, and that now <lb/>
            was his opportunity to offer himself to the Macedonians, <lb/>
            who were in great need of a king. Pyrrhus upbraided <lb/>
            Fortune for placing so many opportunities within his <lb/>
            reach at the same time, and, reflecting that he could only <lb/>
            manage one with success, for some time remained plunged <lb/>
            in thought. At last, thinking that the Sicilian offer was <lb/>
            likely to lead to greater things, as Africa was close to that <lb/>
            island, he decided to accept it, and at once sent Kineas to <lb/>
            prepare the cities for his arrival, as was his wont in such <lb/>
            cases. He himself, meanwhile, placed a strong garrison <lb/>
            in the city of Tarentum, much to the disgust of its citizens, <note type="footnote"> * See an excellent note in Arnold's ‘ History of Rome,' vol. ii. <lb/>
            ch. xxxvii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            who asked him either to perform what he had come <lb/>
            thither to do, namely, to assist them in fighting against <lb/>
            the Romans, or else to evacuate their territory, and leave <lb/>
            their city as he found it. In answer to this demand he <lb/>
            harshly bade them keep quiet, and wait till he was at <lb/>
            leisure to attend to their affairs, and at once set sail for <lb/>
            Sicily. On his arrival there he found all his hopes <lb/>
            realised, as the cities gladly delivered themselves into his <lb/>
            hands. At first he willingly acceded to their request, that <lb/>
            he should wage war on their behalf, and with an army of <lb/>
            thirty thousand foot, two thousand horse, and two hundred <lb/>
            ships, he attacked the Carthaginians, totally defeated <lb/>
            them, and overran the part of Sicily which was subject to <lb/>
            them. Eryx was the strongest of their fortresses, and was <lb/>
            strongly garrisoned. Pyrrhus, learning this, determined to <lb/>
            assault it. When his army was ready, he came forward, <lb/>
            in complete armour, and vowed that he would hold public <lb/>
            games and sacrifices in honour of Herakles, if he should <lb/>
            prove himself that day, before all the Sikeliot Greeks, to <lb/>
            be a worthy descendant of Achilles, and to deserve to com­ <lb/>
            mand so great a force. The trumpet then sounded the <lb/>
            charge, the barbarians were driven from the walls <lb/>
            by a shower of missiles, and the scaling ladders planted <lb/>
            against them. Pyrrhus was the first man to mount the <lb/>
            wall, and there fought singly against a host, dashing some <lb/>
            of them over the inner, and some over the outer edge of <lb/>
            the wall, and wielding his sword with such terrible power <lb/>
            that he soon stood on a pile of corpses. He himself <lb/>
            was quite unhurt, and terrified the enemy by his mere <lb/>
            appearance, proving how truly Homer has told us that of <lb/>
            all virtues courage alone- is wont to display itself in divine <lb/>
            transports and frenzies. After the city was taken he <lb/>
            made a magnificent sacrifice to the gods, and held gymnastic <lb/>
            contests of all kinds.</p>
          <p>XXIII. He now turned his arms against the so-called <lb/>
            Mamertines* of Messina, who troubled the Greek cities <lb/>
            much, and had even made some of them tributary to <lb/>
            themselves. They were numerous and warlike; indeed, <note type="footnote"> * These were the descendants of certain Campanian mercenaries, <lb/>
            who had seized the city of Messina, and from it made war upon the <lb/>
            neighbourhood. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            in Latin, their name means the “ children of Mars. It <lb/>
            Pyrrhus seized and put to death any of them whom he <lb/>
            found exacting tribute from the Greeks, and after defeating <lb/>
            them in a pitched battle, took many of their outlying forts.</p>
          <p>The Carthaginians now were inclined to come to terms <lb/>
            with him. They offered, if peace were concluded, to pay <lb/>
            him tribute, and to supply a fleet for his use. To these <lb/>
            proposals Pyrrhus, dissatisfied with obtaining so little, <lb/>
            answered that he would only make peace and friendship <lb/>
            with them on one condition, which was that they would <lb/>
            evacuate Sicily altogether, and regard the African sea <lb/>
            as their frontier towards Greece. Elated by the great­ <lb/>
            ness of the force at his disposal, and the success which <lb/>
            attended his enterprises, he now aimed at the realisation <lb/>
            of the large hopes of conquest with which he left Greece, <lb/>
            and meditated an attack on Libya. He had a large fleet, <lb/>
            but required many rowers to man it, and these he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to obtain from the allied cities, not by gentle <lb/>
            means, but by harsh, arbitrary, and despotic commands. <lb/>
            Not that he was originally of a tyrannical disposition, <lb/>
            but his character, which at first was open, trustful, <lb/>
            and sociable, gradually altered for the worse, as he <lb/>
            became less dependent upon public opinion and more <lb/>
            firmly fixed upon his throne, until at length he gained <lb/>
            the reputation of an ungrateful and suspicious despot. <lb/>
            The Greek cities, though with much murmuring, sub­ <lb/>
            mitted to this arbitrary impressment, having no other <lb/>
            alternative; but Pyrrhus soon proceeded to even harsher <lb/>
            measures. Thoinon and Sosistratus were the leading men <lb/>
            in Syracuse. It was they who had first invited him into <lb/>
            Sicily, and who, when he arrived there, had placed their <lb/>
            own city in his hands and induced most of the other Greek <lb/>
            communities to join him. Pyrrhus now regarded these <lb/>
            men with suspicion, and knew not whether to take them <lb/>
            with him or leave them behind. Sosistratus, terrified at <lb/>
            the king's evident ill-will, made his escape, upon which <lb/>
            Pyrrhus charged Thoinon with plotting against him with <lb/>
            the other, and put him to death. This caused a sudden <lb/>
            revulsion of feeling from him. The Greek cities began <lb/>
            to regard him with mortal hatred, and some of them <lb/>
            joined the Carthaginians, whilst others invited the Manier­ <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            tines to assist them. And while Pyrrhus saw nothing <lb/>
            in Sicily but disaffection and insurrection against his <lb/>
            power, he received despatches from the Tarentines and <lb/>
            Samnites, informing him that they were confined to the <lb/>
            walls of their cities, and even so could barely defend <lb/>
            themselves against the Romans, while their lands were <lb/>
            all being laid waste, and they urgently needed help. <lb/>
            This intelligence prevented his withdrawal from Sicily <lb/>
            being regarded as a flight, but in reality he had failed <lb/>
            in his attempt to conquer that island, and was as eager to <lb/>
            return to Italy as a shipwrecked sailor is to reach the shore. <lb/>
            It is said that as he was sailing away he looked back at <lb/>
            Sicily and said to his friends, " What a fair field we are <lb/>
            leaving for the Romans and Carthaginians to fight in." <lb/>
            This prophecy, as he expected, was soon afterwards fulfilled.</p>
          <p>XXIV. The barbarians * combined to attack him as he <lb/>
            retreated. He fought a battle at sea with the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginian fleet during his passage to Italy, in which he lost <lb/>
            many ships, while the Mamertines, ten thousand strong, <lb/>
            had crossed into Italy before he could reach it, and al­ <lb/>
            though they did not dare to fight a pitched battle, yet <lb/>
            harassed him by attacking him when entangled in some <lb/>
            rough ground, and threw his entire army into confusion. <lb/>
            Two elephants and many of his rearguard perished. <lb/>
            Pyrrhus himself was at the head of the column of march, <lb/>
            but at once rode to the rear and restored the fight, but <lb/>
            was in great danger from the brave and warlike Mamer­ <lb/>
            tines. He received a blow upon his head from a sword, <lb/>
            which forced him to retire a little way from the battle, <lb/>
            and greatly elated the enemy. One of them, a powerful <lb/>
            man, splendidly armed, ran forward far beyond the rest, <lb/>
            and boastfully challenged him to come forward and fight, <lb/>
            if he were alive. At this Pyrrhus was so exasperated <lb/>
            that he broke forcibly away from the officers who tried <lb/>
            to restrain him, and, with his face covered with blood, and <lb/>
            a savage expression of fury on his countenance, rushed <lb/>
            upon the barbarian, and struck him a blow on the head <lb/>
            which showed both the strength of his arm and the ad­ <lb/>
            mirable temper of his sword, for it clave him completely <note type="footnote"> * " Barbarians" here as elsewhere merely means those who were not <lb/>
            Greeks. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            asunder, so that his body fell down in two pieces This <lb/>
            checked the ardour of the barbarians, who admired and <lb/>
            feared Pyrrhus as a superior being. He was able to <lb/>
            march unopposed for the rest of the way to Tarentum, <lb/>
            to which city he brought a force of twenty thousand in­ <lb/>
            fantry and three thousand cavalry. Taking with him <lb/>
            the best troops of the Tarentines he now marched at once <lb/>
            to attack the Romans, who were encamped in the territory <lb/>
            of the Samnites.</p>
          <p>XXV. The Samnites at this period were entirely ruined <lb/>
            and broken in spirit from the numerous defeats which <lb/>
            they had sustained at the hands of the Romans. Some <lb/>
            dissatisfaction also was felt with Pyrrhus for having <lb/>
            neglected them while he was campaigning in Sicily; so <lb/>
            that not many of that nation joined him. Pyrrhus now <lb/>
            divided his forces, sending one portion into Lucania to <lb/>
            harass the other consul and prevent his coming to the <lb/>
            assistance of his colleague, while he himself led the re­ <lb/>
            mainder to attack Manius Curins, who was quietly en­ <lb/>
            camped near the city of Beneventum, awaiting the arrival <lb/>
            of the Lucanian forces. It is also said that his sooth­ <lb/>
            sayers told him, that the omens were not in favour of his <lb/>
            moving from where he was. Pyrrhus, eager to attack <lb/>
            him before the other consul's army joined him, made a <lb/>
            hurried night march with his best troops and elephants, <lb/>
            hoping to suprise the Roman camp. But during the <lb/>
            march, which was long, and through a densely-wooded <lb/>
            country, their torches went out, the soldiers lost their <lb/>
            way in the darkness, and got into confusion. Day at <lb/>
            length appeared, and showed to the Romans Pyrrhus <lb/>
            with his army, advancing from the heights near their <lb/>
            camp. The sight caused some disorder and excitement, <lb/>
            but as the omens were now favourable, and the emergency <lb/>
            required prompt action, Manius Curius led out his men, <lb/>
            attacked the first troops of Pyrrhus's army whom he met, <lb/>
            routed them, and dismayed the whole force, so that many <lb/>
            were slain and several elephants captured. This success <lb/>
            emboldened Manius to begin a general action on the more <lb/>
            level ground, where he defeated the enemy with one <lb/>
            wing of his army, but on the other his troops were over­ <lb/>
            powered by the charge of the elephants and driven back <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            to their camp. Curing now called to his aid the soldiers <lb/>
            . left to guard the camp, who were standing under arms <lb/>
            along the ramparts, and were quite fresh and unwearied. <lb/>
            They assailed the elephants with a shower of darts, which <lb/>
            caused them to turn and fly, trampling down their own <lb/>
            men in their flight. The Romans thus gained the victory, <lb/>
            and at the same time the reputation of being the first <lb/>
            military nation in the world. For their display of valour <lb/>
            on this occasion led to their being thought invincible, <lb/>
            and to their at once gaining possession of the whole of <lb/>
            Italy, and shortly afterwards of Sicily also.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Thus did Pyrrhus fail in his Italian and <lb/>
            Sicilian expeditions, after spending six years of constant <lb/>
            fighting in those countries, during which he lost a great <lb/>
            part of his force, but always, even in his defeats, preserved <lb/>
            his reputation for invincible bravery, being thought, in <lb/>
            warlike skill and personal strength and daring, to be <lb/>
            by far the first prince of his age. Yet he always threw <lb/>
            away the advantages which he gained, in following some <lb/>
            chimerical scheme of further conquest, being unable to <lb/>
            take proper measures for the present because of his eager­ <lb/>
            ness for the future. On this account Antigonus likened <lb/>
            him to a player who made many good throws with the <lb/>
            dice, but who did not know how to use them. He carried <lb/>
            back to Epirus with him eight thousand infantry and <lb/>
            five hundred cavalry, and, having no money, began to <lb/>
            look out for a war, by which he might support his army, <lb/>
            Some of the Gauls now joined him, and he at once invaded <lb/>
            Macedonia, where Antigonus, the son of I Demetrius, was <lb/>
            now king, with the intention of plundering the country. <lb/>
            Soon, however, as he took several cities, and two thousand <lb/>
            Macedonian soldiers deserted their colours and joined him, <lb/>
            ho began to entertain more ambitious designs, marched <lb/>
            against Antigonus himself, and was able to surprise his <lb/>
            army, near the issue of a defile, by a sudden attack in the <lb/>
            rear. Notwithstanding the general confusion, however, a <lb/>
            strong body of Gauls, who formed the rear-guard, with­ <lb/>
            stood him manfully, but, after a vigorous resistance, were <lb/>
            nearly all cut to pieces, while the elephants, whose retreat <lb/>
            was cut off, were surrendered by their leaders. After <lb/>
            gaining such an advantage as this, Pyrrhus, trusting to <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> p </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            his good fortune, and without calculating the numbers <lb/>
            opposed to him, advanced to attack the Macedonian <lb/>
            phalanx, which was full of disorder and consternation at <lb/>
            the defeat of the rear-guard. No attempt was made by <lb/>
            them to strike a blow. Pyrrhus stretched out his hand <lb/>
            and called the Macedonian officers by their names, and <lb/>
            they at once went over to him, and were followed by all <lb/>
            their men. Antigonus escaped to the sea-coast, where he <lb/>
            -still retained some cities in their obedience.</p>
          <p>Pyrrhus, considering that his victory over the Gauls was <lb/>
            the most glorious part of his recent success, hung the <lb/>
            finest of their arms and spoils in the temple of Athena <lb/>
            Itonis, with the following epigram. <lb/>
            "These spoils doth Pyrrhus the Molossian king, <lb/>
            From the brave Gauls to thee, bright goddess, bring; <lb/>
            He beat Antigonus, with all his men: <lb/>
            Achilles' sons are warriors now as then."</p>
          <p>After the battle he at once recovered the cities on the <lb/>
            seaboard. He took Ægæ, treated the inhabitants very <lb/>
            harshly, and left a garrison of Celtic mercenary troops <lb/>
            in the town. These Gauls, with the insatiate greed for <lb/>
            money for which that nation is noted, proceeded to break <lb/>
            open the sepulchres of the Macedonian kings who were <lb/>
            buried there, in search of plunder, and wantonly scattered <lb/>
            their bones. Pyrrhus seemed but little disturbed at this out­ <lb/>
            rage, either because his affairs gave him no leisure to think <lb/>
            about it, or because he thought it dangerous to punish his <lb/>
            barbarian allies: but the Macedonians were deeply grieved <lb/>
            by it. And yet, although he was far from being firmly <lb/>
            established in his now kingdom, he was already forming <lb/>
            new schemes of conquest. In raillery he called Antigonus <lb/>
            a shameless man because he had not yet laid aside the <lb/>
            royal purple for the dress of a private man, and he eagerly <lb/>
            accepted the invitation of Kleonymus the Spartan to go <lb/>
            and attack Lacedæmon. This Kleonymus was by birth <lb/>
            the rightful heir to the throne, but being thought to be <lb/>
            a violent and tyrannical person he was hated and dis­ <lb/>
            trusted by the Spartans, who had chosen his nephew Areus <lb/>
            to be their king. This was the reason of his having <lb/>
            long borne a grudge against his countrymen, but besides <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            this his feelings had been recently wounded by a family <lb/>
            quarrel.</p>
          <p>Kleonymus, now an elderly man, had married a beauti­ <lb/>
            ful wife of the royal blood, Chilonis, the daughter of <lb/>
            Leotychides. She fell madly in love with Akrotatus, the <lb/>
            son of Areus, a youth in the flower of his age, and the dis­ <lb/>
            honour of Kleonymus became notorious all over Sparta. <lb/>
            This private wrong, added to his previous exclusion from <lb/>
            the throne, so enraged him, that he invited Pyrrhus to <lb/>
            attack Sparta, which he did with an army of twenty- <lb/>
            five thousand foot, two thousand horse, and twenty-four <lb/>
            elephants, so that it was obvious that he did not mean to <lb/>
            gain Sparta for Kleonymus, but to conquer the whole of <lb/>
            Peloponnesus for himself, although he answered some <lb/>
            Spartan envoys who waited on him at Megalopolis in <lb/>
            specious language, stating that he had come with the <lb/>
            intention of restoring to freedom the cities which were <lb/>
            held in subjection by Antigonus, and actually going so far <lb/>
            as to tell them that, if possible, he intended to send his <lb/>
            younger sons to Sparta to be trained in the Laconian <lb/>
            discipline, by which they would be able to surpass all <lb/>
            the other kings of their age. He put off the envoys with <lb/>
            these stories, and made them accompany his army, but on <lb/>
            reaching the Lacedæmonian territory he at once began to <lb/>
            plunder and lay it waste. When the envoys remonstrated <lb/>
            with him for having invaded their country without a <lb/>
            declaration of war, he answered- “ We know well that <lb/>
            neither do you Spartans tell any one beforehand what you <lb/>
            mean to do." One of the envoys, by name Mandrokleides, <lb/>
            said in his broad Laconian speech, " If you are a god, we <lb/>
            shall not be harmed by you, for we have done no wrong; <lb/>
            but if you are a man, you may meet with a stronger man <lb/>
            than yourself."</p>
          <p>XXVII. After this he marched upon Lacedæmon itself. <lb/>
            Kleonymus urged him to make an assault immediately <lb/>
            on the evening of his arrival, but Pyrrhus is said to have <lb/>
            refused to do so, for fear that his soldiers might sack and <lb/>
            destroy the city if they took it at night, while they might <lb/>
            easily take it in the daytime. Indeed the Spartans were <lb/>
            taken by surprise, and very few were in the city, the <lb/>
            king Areus himself being absent ir Crete on an expedi. <note type="footnote"> p 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            turn to assist the people of Gortyna. And it was this <lb/>
            weakness and absence of defenders that really proved <lb/>
            the salvation of the city, for Pyrrhus, not expecting any <lb/>
            resistance, pitched his camp outside the walls, while <lb/>
            the friends and helots of Kleonymus made ready his <lb/>
            house and decorated it, expecting that Pyrrhus would sup <lb/>
            there with him. At nightfall the Lacedæmonians at first <lb/>
            proposed to send away the women to Crete, but they <lb/>
            refused to leave the city. Archidamia* even went to the <lb/>
            senate-house with a drawn sword in her hands, and on <lb/>
            behalf of the women of Sparta reproached the men for <lb/>
            insulting them by supposing that they would survive the <lb/>
            capture of their city. After this, they determined to dig <lb/>
            a ditch along the side of the city nearest to Pyrrhus's <lb/>
            camp, and to barricade the ends of it with waggons <lb/>
            buried up to the axles in the ground, to resist the charge <lb/>
            of the elephants. When this work was begun the women <lb/>
            and girls appeared with their tunics girt up for work,t <lb/>
            and laboured at digging the ditch together with the older <lb/>
            men. They bade those who were to fight on the morrow <lb/>
            take rest, and they themselves alone dug one-third of the <lb/>
            entire ditch. The width of the ditch was six cubits, its <lb/>
            depth four cubits, and its length eight hundred feet, as <lb/>
            we are told by Phylarchus, though Hieronymus makes <lb/>
            its dimensions more moderate. At daybreak, when the <lb/>
            enemy began to bestir themselves, the women armed the <lb/>
            younger men, and handed over the ditch to them, bidding <lb/>
            them defend it, as it would be pleasant for them to con­ <note type="footnote"> * On this passage Thirlwall (' History of Greece,' chapter lx,) has <lb/>
            the following note: “Flathe (vol. ii. p. 94) conceives that the waggons <lb/>
            were placed in the ditch, which I can neither understand, nor reconcile <lb/>
            with Plutarch's description. Clough follows Flathe, and says that <lb/>
            'the waggons were sunk in the ditch, here and there along it.' <lb/>
            Plutarch's description is most unfortunately brief. We do not know <lb/>
            to what extent Sparta had been fortified during its wars with Kassander <lb/>
            and Demetrius, or whether the ditch which was dug on this occasion <lb/>
            covered the only gap in the walls. At any rate it is hard to under­ <lb/>
            stand why the Spartans, according to Clough, should dig a ditch an I <lb/>
            then sink their waggons in it, as in that case they might as well not <lb/>

            arms of their mothers and wives after having fought <lb/>

            order that if the city were taken she might not fall into <lb/>

            infantry against the Spartans, who were drawn up in deep <lb/>
            order, and endeavoured to force his way through them, <lb/>
            and to pass the ditch, which was difficult, because the <lb/>
            newly dug earth afforded no secure footing to his soldiers. <lb/>
            Meanwhile his son Ptolemy led a chosen body of two <lb/>
            thousand Gauls and Chaonians round the end of the <lb/>
            ditch, and endeavoured to break through the barricade of <lb/>
            waggons. These stood so thick and so close together that <lb/>
            they made it hard, not only for the assailants to cross <lb/>
            them, but even for the Lacedæmonians to reach the point <lb/>
            where they were menaced. However, as the Gauls began <lb/>
            to pull the wheels out of the earth and to drag the <lb/>
            waggons down towards the river, the young Akrotatus <lb/>
            perceiving the danger, sallied out from the city at another <lb/>
            point with three hundred men, and got round behind <lb/>
            Ptolemy's force, from whom he was concealed by some <lb/>
            hilly ground. Then he vigorously assailed the Gauls in <lb/>
            the rear, and forced them to face about and defend them­ <lb/>
            selves, which caused great confusion, as they were driven <lb/>
            among the waggons and into the ditch by the Spartans <lb/>
            until at last they were forced to retreat. This glorious <lb/>
            exploit of Akrotatus was witnessed from the city walls <lb/>
            by the old men and all the women. As he returned <lb/>
            through the city to his appointed post, covered with blood <lb/>
            and rejoicing in his victory, the Spartan women thought <lb/>
            that he had grown taller and more handsome than before, <lb/>
            and they envied Chilonis her lover. Some of the old men <lb/>
            even followed him, shouting, " Go home, Akrotatus, and <lb/>
            enjoy yourself with Chilonis : only beget brave sons for <lb/>
            Sparta." Where Pyrrhus fought a terrible battle took <lb/>
            place, and many valiant deeds were wrought. A Spartan <lb/>
            named Pbyllius, after greatly distinguishing himself and <lb/>
            slaying many of the assailants, when he felt himself mor­ <lb/>
            tally wounded, made way for his rear rank-man to take hia <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            place, and died inside the line of shields, in. order that <lb/>
            his corpse might not fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>
          <p>XXIX. The battle ceased at night, and during his <lb/>
            sleep Pyrrhus dreamed a dream, that he cast thunder­ <lb/>
            bolts upon Lacedæmon, set it all on fire, and rejoiced at <lb/>
            the sight. Being awakened by his delight at this vision, <lb/>
            he ordered his officers to hold the troops in readiness and <lb/>
            related the dream to his friends, auguring from it that he <lb/>
            should take the city by assault. They were all of them <lb/>
            delighted at the vision, and certain that it portended <lb/>
            success, except one Lysimachus, who said that he feared <lb/>
            that, as places struck by thunderbolts may not be walked <lb/>
            over, Heaven might mean to signify to Pyrrhus by this <lb/>
            that he never should set foot in the city. Pyrrhus how­ <lb/>
            ever answered that this was more empty gossip, and that <lb/>
            they had better take their arms in their hands and remem­ <lb/>
            ber that <lb/>
            " The best of omens is King Pyrrhus's cause. " <lb/>
            He rose, and at daybreak led his troops again to the assault. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians defended themselves with a spirit and <lb/>
            courage beyond what could be expected from their small <lb/>
            numbers. The women mingled in the thick of the fight, <lb/>
            supplying food, drink, and missile weapons wherever they <lb/>
            were needed, and carrying away the wounded. The <lb/>
            Macedonians endeavoured to fill up the ditch by flinging <lb/>
            large quantities of wood into it, covering the arms and <lb/>
            dead bodies which lay at the bottom. As the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians were resisting this attempt, they saw Pyrrhus on <lb/>
            horseback trying to cross the line of waggons and the <lb/>
            ditch, and force his way into the city. A shout was <lb/>
            raised by the garrison at the spot, and the women began to <lb/>
            scream and run wildly about. Pyrrhus had made his way <lb/>
            through all obstacles and was about to attack the nearest <lb/>
            of those who disputed his passage, when his horse, struck <lb/>
            in the body by a Cretan javelin, reared in the death-agony, <lb/>
            and threw Pyrrhus to the ground. He fell on a steep bank, <note type="footnote"> * I have adopted Clough's excellent version of the well-known <lb/>
            passage in ' Iliad,' xii. 243, where Hector says that he cares not for the <lb/>
            flight of birds or any other omen, but that " The best of omens is one'a <lb/>
            country's cause." </note><lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            and his fall caused such consternation among his followers <lb/>
            that a timely charge of the Spartans drove them hack. <lb/>
            Upon this he gave orders to put a stop to the assault, for he <lb/>
            imagined that the Lacedæmonians would soon offer terms <lb/>
            of surrender, as they were nearly all wounded, and had <lb/>
            lost many men. However, the good fortune of the city, <lb/>
            which may have wished to test the Spartan courage to the <lb/>
            utmost, or to prove its own power to save the city when all <lb/>
            hope seemed lost, brought Ameinias the Phokian, one of <lb/>
            the generals of Antigonus, with a body of mercenary troops <lb/>
            to help the Spartans in this their darkest hour. Shortly <lb/>
            after they had received this reinforcement, their king, <lb/>
            Areus, arrived from Crete with two thousand men. The <lb/>
            women now returned to their homes, not thinking it to be <lb/>
            necessary any longer for them to take an active part in <lb/>
            the war, while those old men too who had been forced by <lb/>
            necessity to take up arms, were relieved by the new <lb/>
            comers, who took their places in the line of battle against <lb/>
            the enemy.</p>
          <p>XXX. These reinforcements piqued Pyrrhus into making <lb/>
            several more attempts to take the city, in which however <lb/>
            he was repulsed and wounded. He now retired, and began <lb/>
            to plunder the country, professing his intention to winter <lb/>
            there. But no man can resist his destiny. There were in <lb/>
            Argos two parties, one headed by Aristeas, and the other <lb/>
            by Aristippus. The latter was favoured by Antigonns, <lb/>
            which induced Aristeas to invite Pyrrhus to Argos. He <lb/>
            was ever willing to embark on a new enterprise, because <lb/>
            he regarded his successes merely as stepping-stones to <lb/>
            greater things, and hoped to retrieve his failures by new <lb/>
            and more daring exploits; so that he was rendered equally <lb/>
            restless by victory or defeat. Accordingly he set off at <lb/>
            once for Argos. Areus occupied the most difficult of the <lb/>
            passes on the road with an ambuscade, and attacked the <lb/>
            Gauls and Molossians who formed the rear-guard. Pyrrhus <lb/>
            had been warned by his soothsayers that the livers of the <lb/>
            victims wanted one lobe, which portended the loss of one <lb/>
            of his relatives, but at this crisis the disorder and confusion <lb/>
            into which his army was thrown by the ambush made him <lb/>
            forget the omen, and order his son Ptolemy to take his <lb/>
            guards and go to the help "f the rearguard, while he him­ <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            self hurried his main body on through the defile. When <lb/>
            Ptolemy came up a fierce battle took place. The flower <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonian army, led by Eualkus, engaged with <lb/>
            the troops immediately around Ptolemy, and while they <lb/>
            fought, a Cretan named Oryssus, a native of Aptera, run­ <lb/>
            ning forward on the flank, struck the young main, who was <lb/>
            fighting bravely, with a javelin, and killed him. His fall <lb/>
            caused his troops to retreat, and they were hard pressed by <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, who were so excited by their victory <lb/>
            that they were carried by their ardour far into the plain, <lb/>
            where their retreat was cut off by Pyrrhus's infantry. <lb/>
            Pyrrhus himself, who had just heard of the death of his <lb/>
            son, in an agony of grief now ordered the Molossian cavalry <lb/>
            to charge them. He was the first to ride among the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and terribly avenged his son by cutting <lb/>
            them down. Pyrrhus in battle was always a terrific figure, <lb/>
            whom none dared to resist, but on this occasion he sur­ <lb/>
            passed himself in courage and fury. At length he rode up <lb/>
            to Eualkus, who avoided his charge, and aimed a blow at <lb/>
            him with his sword which just missed Pyrrhus's bridle <lb/>
            hand, but cut through his reins. Pyrrhus ran him through <lb/>
            with his spear at the same moment, but fell from his horse, <lb/>
            and, fighting henceforth on foot, slew all the chosen band <lb/>
            commanded by Eualkus. This was a severe loss to Sparta, <lb/>
            incurred as it was unnecessarily, after the war was really <lb/>
            over, from the desire of their generals to distinguish <lb/>
            themselves.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Pyrrhus celebrated his son's obsequies with <lb/>
            splendid games.- His grief was partly satiated by the <lb/>
            revenge which he had taken upon the enemy, and he <lb/>
            now marched towards Argos. Hearing that Antigonus <lb/>
            was encamped upon one of the heights near the city, he <lb/>
            himself pitched his camp at Nauplia. On the next day <lb/>
            he sent a herald to Antigonus with an insulting message, <lb/>
            challenging him to come down upon the level ground and <lb/>
            fight. Antigonus answered that he should fight only when <lb/>
            he chose, but that if Pyrrhus was weary of his life, he <lb/>
            could find many other ways to die. Ambassadors from <lb/>
            Argos also came to each of them, begging them to with­ <note type="footnote"> * Compare the games which Achilles, in the 'Iliad,' holds at the <lb/>
            funeral of Patrokrus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            draw their forces, and allow the city to remain indepen­ <lb/>
            dent and friendly to both. Antigonus accepted this offer, <lb/>
            and handed over his son to the Argives as a hostage, <lb/>
            while Pyrrhus agreed to retire, but, as he gave no pledge, <lb/>
            was viewed with greater suspicion than before. A strange <lb/>
            portent also happened to Pyrrhus, for the heads of the <lb/>
            oxen which had been sacrificed, when lying apart from <lb/>
            their bodies, were observed to put out their tongues and <lb/>
            lap their own gore; and in the city the priestess of <lb/>
            Apollo Lykius rushed about in frenzy, crying out that <lb/>
            she saw the whole city full of slaughtered corpses, and an <lb/>
            eagle coming to the fight and then disappearing.</p>
          <p>XXXII. During the following night, which was very <lb/>
            dark, Pyrrhus marched his troops up to the walls, found <lb/>
            the gate called Diamperes opened to him by Aristeas, <lb/>
            and was able to march his Gaulish troops into the city <lb/>
            and seize the market-place unobserved : but the elephants <lb/>
            could not pass through the gate until their towers were <lb/>
            taken off their backs. The removal of these towers, in the <lb/>
            darkness, and the replacing them when the elephants had <lb/>
            passed through the gate, caused an amount of delay and <lb/>
            confusion which at length roused the slumbering inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants ; they ran together to the place called " the Shield," <lb/>
            and the other places of strength in the city, and sent <lb/>
            messengers to call Antigonus to their aid. He at once <lb/>
            marched up close to the city, and remained there with <lb/>
            a reserve, but sent his son and several cf his officers with <lb/>
            a large part of his forces to assist the Argives within <lb/>
            their city walls. Areus the king of Sparta also arrived, <lb/>
            with a thousand Cretans and the swiftest footed of the <lb/>
            Spartans. All these troops now at once attacked the Gauls <lb/>
            and threw them into great disorder. As Pyrrhus, however, <lb/>
            marched in bv the street called Kylarabis, his soldiers <lb/>
            raised a warlike shout: and he, noticing that the shout <lb/>
            was echoed by the Gauls in the market-place in an un­ <lb/>
            decided, faint-hearted fashion, at once guessed that they <lb/>
            were being hard pressed. He instantly pressed the horse­ <lb/>
            men with him to charge, which they did with great <lb/>
            difficulty, as the horses kept falling into the watercourses <lb/>
            with which the whole city is intersected. The night <lb/>
            was spent in wild tumult and skirmishing in the narrow <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            lanes, both parties being unable to recognize or obey their <lb/>
            leaders, and eagerly awaiting the dawn. The first rays <lb/>
            of light showed Pyrrhus the whole open square called " the <lb/>
            Shield " full of enemies, while he was even more disturbed <lb/>
            by the sight of a brazen statue in the market-place, repre­ <lb/>
            senting a wolf and a bull about to attack one another; for <lb/>
            he remembered an oracle which had long before foretold <lb/>
            that he must die when he should see a wolf fighting <lb/>
            with a bull. The Argives say that this statue comme­ <lb/>
            morates the legend that Danaus when he first landed in the <lb/>
            country at Pyramia, near Thyrea, was marching towards <lb/>
            Argos when he saw a wolf fighting with a bull. Danaus <lb/>
            decided that the wolf must represent himself, because he <lb/>
            was a stranger, and was come to attack the people of the <lb/>
            country, like it; and he stopped and watched the fight. <lb/>
            When the wolf gained the day, he offered prayer to Apollo <lb/>
            Lykius, made his attempt upon the throne of Argos, and <lb/>
            was successful, as Gelanor, who was then king, was forced <lb/>
            into exile by a revolution. This is the account which <lb/>
            the Argives give of these statues.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. This sight, and the failure of his plans, dis­ <lb/>
            heartened Pyrrhus, and he began to think of retreating. <lb/>
            As the gates were narrow, he sent to his son Helenus, <lb/>
            who had been left with a large force without the city, <lb/>
            ordering him to break down a part of the wall, and pro­ <lb/>
            tect the fugitives, if they were pressed by the enemy. <lb/>
            But in the hurry and confusion the messenger did not <lb/>
            clearly explain his orders, and by some mistake the young <lb/>
            Helenus took all the remaining elephants and the best <lb/>
            troops, and marched through the gate with them to help <lb/>
            his father. Pyrrhus was already beginning to retire. As <lb/>
            long as he fought in the market-place, where there was <lb/>
            ample room, he effected his retreat in good order, and kept <lb/>
            off the assailants by occasional movements in advance. <lb/>
            But when his troops began to march down the narrow <lb/>
            street leading to the gate, they were met face to face by <lb/>
            the reinforcement coming to their assistance. At this <lb/>
            crisis some of the soldiers refused to obey Pyrrhus's order <lb/>
            to retreat, while others who were willing enough to do <lb/>
            so could not stem the tide of men marching in from the <lb/>
            gate. At the gate itself too the largest of the elephants <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            had fallen sideways and lay there bellowing, blocking up <lb/>
            the way for those who were trying to pass out, while one <lb/>
            of the elephants of the reinforcing party, called the <lb/>
            Conqueror," was looking for his master, who had fallen off <lb/>
            his back mortally wounded. Charging violently back <lb/>
            against the surging tide of fugitives, the faithful beast <lb/>
            trampled down friends and foes alike until he found his <lb/>
            master's body, when he seized it with his trunk and <lb/>
            carried it upon his tusks; and then, turning round in a <lb/>
            frenzy of gi ief, overturned and crushed every one whom <lb/>
            he met. As the men were thus crowded together, no one <lb/>
            could do anything to help himself, but the whole mass <lb/>
            surged backwards and forwards in one solid body. The <lb/>
            enemy who attacked them behind did them but little hurt; <lb/>
            they suffered chiefly from one another, because when a <lb/>
            man had once drawn his sword or couched his lance he <lb/>
            could not put it up again, and it pierced whoever might <lb/>
            happen to be forced against it.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Pyrrhus, seeing the danger with which he <lb/>
            was menaced on every side, took off the royal diadem <lb/>
            from his helmet, and gave it to one of his companions. <lb/>
            He himself, trusting to the fact of his being on horseback, <lb/>
            now charged into the mass of assailants, and was struck <lb/>
            through his cuirass by one of them with a spear. The <lb/>
            wound was not a dangerous or important one, and Pyrrhus <lb/>
            at once turned to attack the man from whom he had <lb/>
            received it. He was an Argive, not of noble birth, but <lb/>
            the son of a poor old woman, who, like the rest, was <lb/>
            looking on at the battle from the roof of her house. As <lb/>
            soon as she saw Pyrrhus attacking her son, in an ecstasy <lb/>
            of fear and rage she took up a tile and hurled it at <lb/>
            Pyrrhus. It struck him on the helmet, bruising the spine <lb/>
            at the back of his neck, and he fell from his horse, blinded <lb/>
            by the stroke, at the side of the sacred enclosure of <lb/>
            Likymnius. Few recognized him, but one Zopyrus, who <lb/>
            was in the service of Antigonus, and two or three others, <lb/>
            seized him just as he was beginning to recover his senses, <lb/>
            and dragged him into an archway near at hand. When <lb/>
            Zopyrus drew an Illyrian sword to cut off his head <lb/>
            Pyrrhus looked so fiercely at him that he was terrified, <lb/>
            and bungled in his work, but at length managed to sever <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            his head from his body. By this time most men bad <lb/>
            learned what had happened, and Halkyoneus, running <lb/>
            up, asked to see the head, that he might identify it. <lb/>
            When he obtained this he rode off with it to his father, <lb/>
            and finding him sitting amongst his friends, he threw it <lb/>
            down at his feet. Antigonus when he recognized it <lb/>
            chased his son out of his presence, striking him with his <lb/>
            staff, and calling him accursed and barbarous, and then <lb/>
            covered his own face with his mantle and wept, remem­ <lb/>
            bering how in his own family his grandfather Antigonus <lb/>
            and his father Demetrius had experienced similar reverses <lb/>
            of fortune. He had the body and head of Pyrrhus <lb/>
            decently arranged on a funeral pyre and burned. Halky­ <lb/>
            oneus, meeting Helenus in poor and threadbare clothes, <lb/>
            embraced him kindly, and led him to Antigonus, who <lb/>
            said to him, " This meeting, my boy, is better than the <lb/>
            other; but still you do not do right in not removing these <lb/>
            clothes, which rather seem to disgrace us who are, as it <lb/>
            appears, the victors." He treated Helenus with great <lb/>
            kindness, and sent him back to his kingdom of Epirus <lb/>
            loaded with presents, and also showed great favour towards <lb/>
            the friends of Pyrrhus, who, together with all his army <lb/>
            and war material, had fallen into his hands.</p><pb n="221"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CAIUS MARIUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. I CANNOT mention any third name- of Caius Marine, <lb/>
            any more than of Quintus Sertorius, who held Spain, or <lb/>
            of Lucius Mummius, who took Corinth; for the name <note type="footnote"> * When Plutarch wrote, the system of naming persons among the <lb/>
            Romans had undergone some changes, or at least the old fashion was <lb/>
            not strictly observed, and this will explain his remark at the end of <lb/>
            the chapter. A Roman had usually three names, as Caius Julius <lb/>
            Cæsar. The first name, which was called the Prænomen, denoted the <lb/>
            individual: the most common names of this class were Quintus, Caius, <lb/>
            Marcus, Lucius, and so on. The second name denoted the gens, and was <lb/>
            called the Gentile name, as Cornelius, Julius, Licinius, Mucius, Sem­ <lb/>
            pronius, and so on. The same gene often contained different families; <lb/>
            thus there were Licinii Crassi, Licinii Luculli, and so on. This third <lb/>
            name was called the Cognomen, and was given to the founder of the <lb/>
            family or to some member of the gens in respect of some personal <lb/>
            peculiarity or other accidental circumstance, as Scipio, Cicero, Crassus, <lb/>
            Lucullus, Gracchus. A fourth name, or Agnomen, was sometimes added, <lb/>
            as in the case of Publius Cornelius Scipio, the elder, who received <lb/>
            the name of Africanus from his conquest of Africa. This agnomen <lb/>
            might be the third name, when there was no cognomen, as in the case <lb/>
            of Lucius Mummius, who received the name of Achaicus because he <lb/>
            overthrew the Achæan League in that war, of which the concluding <lb/>
            event was the destruction of Corinth, which belonged to the League. <lb/>
            Poseidonius means that the prænomen (Quintus, Marcus, &amp;c.) was more <lb/>
            used in speaking of or to an individual; but in Plutarch's time the <lb/>
            cognomen or agnomen was most used. We speak of the three Casalis, <lb/>
            Vespasianus and his two sons Titus and Domitianus, yet the gentile <lb/>
            name of all of them was Flavius. The complete names of the first <lb/>
            two were Titus Flavius Vespasianus, and of the third Titus Flavius <lb/>
            Domitianus. <lb/>
            Women had usually one name, derived from their gens; thus all <lb/>
            the women of the Cornelii, Julii, Licinii, were called Cornelia, Julia, <lb/>
            Licinia; and if there were several daughters in a family, they were <lb/>
            distinguished by the names First, Second, and so on. It there were <lb/>
            two daughters only, they were called respectively Major and Minor. <lb/>
            Sulla called one of his daughters Fausta. (See Cicero, Ad Div. viii <lb/>
            7, Paula Valeria; and the note of P. Manutius.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            Achaicus was given to Mummius in c mmemoration of <lb/>
            this event, just as the name Africans was given to <lb/>
            bcipio, and Macedonicus to Metellus. Tris seems to Posei­ <lb/>
            donius to be the strongest refutation of the opinion of those <lb/>
            who suppose that the third name was the proper individual <lb/>
            name among the Romans, such as Camillus, and Marcellus, <lb/>
            and Cato ; for he argues, if this were so, those who had <lb/>
            only the two names would be really without a name. <lb/>
            But Poseidonius does not perceive that by this argument <lb/>
            he on his side makes the women to be without names: <lb/>
            for no woman ever has the first of the three names, which <lb/>
            first, however, Poseidonius supposes to be the name which <lb/>
            marked individuals among the Romans ; and of the other <lb/>
            two names, he supposes the one to be common and to <lb/>
            belong to all of one kin, such as the Pompeii and the <lb/>
            Manlii and the Cornelii, just as the Greeks might speak <lb/>
            of the Herakleidæ and the Pelopidæ; but the other name <lb/>
            he supposes to be an appellation given as a distinctive <lb/>
            name, either with reference to a man's disposition or his <lb/>
            actions, or some character and peculiarity of his person, <lb/>
            such as Macrinus and Torquatus and Sulla, which may <lb/>
            be compared with the Greek Mnemon or Grypus or <lb/>
            Kallinikus. However, in such matters as these the <lb/>
            diversity in usage allows a variety of conjectures.</p>
          <p>II. With respect to the personal appearance of Marius, <lb/>
            I saw a stone statue * of him at Ravenna in Gaul, which <lb/>
            was perfectly in accordance with what is said of the <lb/>
            roughness and harshness of his character. He was <lb/>
            naturally of a courageous and warlike turn, and had more <lb/>
            of the discipline of the camp than of the state, and <lb/>
            accordingly his temper was ungovernable when he was in <lb/>
            the possession of power. It is stated that he never studied <lb/>
            Greek literature, and never availed himself of the Greek <lb/>
            language for any serious purpose, for he said it was <lb/>
            ridiculous to study a literature the teachers of which <note type="footnote"> * Some understand the word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκών</foreign>) to mean a bust here. The <lb/>
            word is used in both senses, and also to signify a picture. When the <lb/>
            statue of Tiberius Gracchus the father is spoken of (Caius Gracchus, <lb/>
            c. 10), Plutarch uses a different word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰνδρίας</foreign>). Plutarch speaks of <lb/>
            Ravenna as in Gaul, which he calls Galatia; but though Ravenna <lb/>
            was within the limits of Cisalpine Gaul, the name of Italy had been <lb/>
            extended to the whole Peninsula south of the Alps about B.C. 44. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            were the slaves of others; and after his second triumph, <lb/>
            when he exhibited Greek plays * on the occasion of the <lb/>
            dedication of a certain temple, though he came to the <lb/>
            theatre, he only sat down for a moment and then went <lb/>
            away. Xenokrates the philosopher was considered to be <lb/>
            rather of a morose temper, and Plato was in the habit of <lb/>
            frequently saying to him, " My good Xenokrates, sacrifice <lb/>
            to the Graces:' in like manner, if Marins could have been <lb/>
            persuaded to sacrifice to the Grecian Muses and Graces, he <lb/>
            would never have brought a most illustrious military and <lb/>
            civil career to a most unseemly conclusion; through passion <lb/>
            and unreasonable love of power and insatiable desire of <lb/>
            self-aggrandizement driven to terminate his course in an <lb/>
            old age of cruelty and ferocity. Let this, however, be <lb/>
            judged of by the facts as they will presently appear.</p>
          <p>III. Marius was the son of obscure parents, who gained <lb/>
            their living by the labour of their hands, and were poor. <lb/>
            His father's name was Marius; his mother'is name was <lb/>
            Fulcinia. It was late before he saw Rome and became <lb/>
            acquainted with the habits of the city, up to which time <lb/>
            he lived at Cirrhæato, † a village in the territory of <lb/>
            Arpinum, where his mode of life was rude, when con­ <lb/>
            trasted with the polite and artificial fashions of a city, <lb/>
            but temperate and in accordance with the old Roman <lb/>
            discipline. He first served against the Celtiberians when <lb/>
            Scipio Africanus was besieging Numantia, and he attracted <lb/>
            the notice of his commander by his superiority in courage <lb/>
            over all the other young soldiers, and by the readine s <lb/>
            with which he adapted himself to the change in living <lb/>
            which Scipio introduced among the troops, who had been <lb/>
            corrupted by luxurious habits and extravagance. He is <lb/>
            said also to have killed one of the enemy in single combat <lb/>
            in the presence of the general. Accordingly Marius re­ <lb/>
            ceived from Scipio various honourable distinctions; and <note type="footnote"> * Literally " shows :" they might be plays or they might be other <lb/>
            amusements. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is probably a corrupt name. The territory of Arpinum,. now <lb/>
            Arpino, was in the Volscian mountains. Arpinum was also the birth- <lb/>
            place of Cicero. Juvenal in his rhetorical fashion (Sat. viii. 245) <lb/>
            represents the young Marius as earning his bread by working at the <lb/>
            plough as a servant and afterwards entering the army as a common <lb/>
            soldier. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            on one occasion, after supper, when the conversation was <lb/>
            about generals, and one of the company, either because <lb/>
            he really felt a difficulty or merely wished to flatter <lb/>
            Scipio, asked him where the Roman people would find <lb/>
            such another leader and protector when he was gone, <lb/>
            Scipio with his hand gently touched the shoulder of <lb/>
            Marius, who was reclining next to him, and said, <lb/>
            " Perhaps here." So full of promise was the youth Or <lb/>
            Marius, and so discerning was the judgment of Scipio.</p>
          <p>IV. Now it is said that Marius, mainly encouraged by <lb/>
            these words, which he viewed as a divine intimation, <lb/>
            entered on a political career, and obtained the tribune­ <lb/>
            ship, in which he was assisted by Cæcilius Metellus,* <lb/>
            of whose house the family of Marius had long been an <lb/>
            adherent. During his tribuneship Marius proposed a <lb/>
            law on the mode of voting, which apparently tended <lb/>
            to deprive the nobles of their power in the Judicia: <lb/>
            the measure was opposed by Cotta, the consul, who <lb/>
            persuaded the Senate to resist the proposed law, and <lb/>
            to summon Marius to account for his conduct. The <lb/>
            decree proposed by Cotta was drawn up, and Marius <lb/>
            appeared before the Senate; but so far from being <lb/>
            disconcerted, as a young man might naturally be, who <lb/>
            without any advantages had just stepped into public <lb/>
            life, he already assumed the tone which his subsequent <lb/>
            exploits authorized, and threatened to carry off Cotta <lb/>
            to prison if he did not rescind the decree. Upon Cotta <lb/>
            turning to Metellus and asking his opinion, Metellus <lb/>
            arose and supported the consul; but Marius, sending <lb/>
            for the officer who was outside of the house, ordered him <note type="footnote"> * Lucius Aurelius Cotta and Lucius Cæcilius Met Ilus were consuls <lb/>
            B.C. 119, in which year Marius was tribune. The law which Marius <lb/>
            proposed had for its object to make the Ponies narrower. The Pontes <lb/>
            were the passages through which the voters went into the Septa or <lb/>
            inclesures where they voted. After passing through the ponies they <lb/>
            received the voting tablets at the entrance of the septa. The object <lb/>
            of the law of Marius was to diminish the crowd and pressure by <lb/>
            jetting fewer persons come in at a time. Cicero speaks of this law of <lb/>
            Marius (De Legibus, iii. 17). As the law had reference to elections <lb/>
            and its object was among other things to prevent bribery, Plutarch's <lb/>
            remark is unintelligible: the text is corrupt, or he has made a <lb/>
            mistake. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            to carry off Metellus himself to prison. Metellus ap­ <lb/>
            pealed to the rest of the tribunes without effect, and <lb/>
            the Senate yielded and abandoned the decree. Marius <lb/>
            now triumphantly came before the popular assembly <lb/>
            and got his law ratified, having proved himself to be <lb/>
            a man unassailable by fear, not to be diverted from <lb/>
            his purpose by any motive of personal respect, and a <lb/>
            formidable opponent to the Senate by his measures which <lb/>
            were adapted to win the public favour. But he soon gave <lb/>
            people reason to change their opinion; for he most <lb/>
            resolutely opposed a measure for the distribution of <lb/>
            corn among the citizens, and succeeding in his opposi­ <lb/>
            tion, he established himself in equal credit with both <lb/>
            parties, as a man who would do nothing to please either, <lb/>
            if it were contrary to the public interest.</p>
          <p>V. After the tribuneship he was a candidate for the <lb/>
            greater ædileship. Now there are two classes of ædile- <lb/>
            ships : one, which derives its name (curule *) from the <lb/>
            seats with curved feet on which the ædiles sit when <note type="footnote"> * The higher magistrates of Rome, the curule ædiles, prætors, <lb/>
            consuls, censors, and dictator had a chair of office called a Sella <lb/>
            Curulis, or Curule seat, which Plutarch correctly describes as a chair <lb/>
            with curved feet (See the out in Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities, <lb/>
            " Sella Curulis"). The name Curule is derived frem Currus, a chariot, <lb/>
            as the old writers say, and as is proved by the expression Curulis <lb/>
            Triumpbus, a Curule Triumph, which is opposed to an Ovatio, in <lb/>
            which the triumphing general went on foot in the procession. </note><note type="footnote"> The Plebeian Ædiles were first elected B.C. 494, at the same time <lb/>
            as the Plebeian tribunes. They had various functions, such as the <lb/>
            general superintendence of buildings, the supply of water, the care of <lb/>
            the streets and pavements, and other like matters. Their duties <lb/>
            mainly belonged to the department of police, under which was included <lb/>
            the superintendence of the markets, and of buying and selling. The <lb/>
            Plebeian AEdiles were originally two in number. </note><note type="footnote"> The Curule AEdiles were first elected B.C. 365 and only from the <lb/>
            Patricians, but afterwards the office was accessible to the Plebeians. <lb/>
            The functions of the Plebeian AEdiles seem to have been performed <lb/>
            by all the AEdiles indifferently after B c. 368, though the Curule <lb/>
            Ædiles alone had the power of making Edicts (edicta), which power <lb/>
            was founded on their general superintendence of all buying and <lb/>
            selling, and many of their rules had reference to the buying and <lb/>
            selling of slaves (Dig. 21, tit. 1). The Curule AEdiles only had the <lb/>
            superintendence of some of the greater festivals, on which occasions <lb/>
            they went to great expense to gratify the people and buy popularity <lb/>
            as a means of further promotion. (See Sulla, c. 5.) </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            they discharge their functions; the other, the inferior, <lb/>
            is called the plebeian ædileship. When they have chosen <lb/>
            the higher ædiles, they then take the vote again for the <lb/>
            election of the others. Now as Marius was manifestly <lb/>
            losing in the votes for the curule ædileship, he forthwith <lb/>
            changed about and became a candidate for the other <lb/>
            ædileship. But this was viewed as an audacious and <lb/>
            arrogant attempt, and he failed in his election ; but <lb/>
            though he thus met with two repulses in one day, which <lb/>
            never happened to any man before, he did not abate one <lb/>
            tittle of his pretensions, for no long time after he was a <lb/>
            candidate for a preetorship,* in which he narrowly missed <lb/>
            a failure, being the last of all who were declared to be <lb/>
            elected, and he was prosecuted for bribery.† What gave <lb/>
            rise to most suspicion was the fact that a slave of Cassius <lb/>
            Sabaco t was seen within the septa mingled with the <lb/>
            voters; for Sabaco was one of the most intimate friends <lb/>
            of Marius. Accordingly Sabaco was cited before the <note type="footnote"> * At this time there were six Prætors. The Prætor Urbanus or <lb/>
            City Prætor was sometimes simply called Prætor and had the chief <lb/>
            administration of justice in Rome. The Prætor Peregrinus also resided <lb/>
            in Rome and had the superintendence in matters in dispute between <lb/>
            Roman citizens and aliens (peregrini). The other Prætors had pro­ <lb/>
            vinces allotted to them to administer; and after the expiration of their <lb/>
            year of office, the prætors generally received the administration of <lb/>
            a Province with the title of Proprætor. It appears (c. 5) that Marius <lb/>
            either stayed at Rome during his prætorship or had some Province in <lb/>
            Italy. As to the meaning of the Roman word Province, see Caius <lb/>
            Gracchus, c. 19, note. </note><note type="footnote"> t Bribery at elections among the Romans was called Ambitus, <lb/>
            which literally signifies "a going about;" it then came to signify <lb/>
            canvassing; solicitation, the giving and promising of money for votes, <lb/>
            and all the means for accomplishing this end, in which the recurrence <lb/>
            of elections at Rome annually made candidates very expert. The <lb/>
            first law specially directed against the giving of money (largitiones) <lb/>
            was the Lex Cornelia Bæbia, B.C. 182; and there were many subse­ <lb/>
            quent enactments, but all failed to accomplish their object. The Lex <lb/>
            Bæbia incapacitated him who gave a bribe to obtain office from filling <lb/>
            any office for ten years. </note><note type="footnote"> t His alleged intemperance consisted in not being able to endure <lb/>
            thirst on such an occasion. His real offence was his conduct which <lb/>
            made him suspected of acting as an agent of Marius in the election. <lb/>
            It was one of the duties of the Censors, when revising the lists of <lb/>
            Equites and Senator?, to erase the names of those whom they considered <lb/>
            unworthy of the rank, and this without giving any reason for it. </note> <lb/>

            judices; he explained the circumstance by saying that <lb/>
            the heat had made him very thirsty, and he called for <lb/>
            a cup of cold water, which his slave brought to him <lb/>
            within the septa, and left it as soon as he had drunk <lb/>
            the water. Sabaco was ejected from the Senate by the <lb/>
            next censors, and people were of opinion that he deserved <lb/>
            it, either because he had given false testimony or for his <lb/>
            intemperance. Caius Herennius also was summoned as <lb/>
            a witness against Marius, but he declared that it was <lb/>
            contrary to established usage to give testimony against <lb/>
            a client * and that patrons (for this is the name that the <note type="footnote"> * The words Patron and Client are now used by us, but, like many <lb/>
            other Roman term?, not in the original or proper sense. Dominus and <lb/>
            Servus, Muster and Slave, were terms placed in opposition to one <lb/>
            another, like Patron and Client, Patronus and Cliens. A master who <lb/>
            manumitted his slave became his Patronus, a kind of father (for Patro­ <lb/>
            nus is derived from Pater, father): the slave was called the Patron's <lb/>
            Libertus, freedman; and all Liberti were included in the class Liber­ <lb/>
            tint. Libertinus is another example of a word which we use (libertine), <lb/>
            though not in the Roman sense. But the old Roman relation of Patron <lb/>
            and Client was not this. Originally the heads of distinguished families <lb/>
            had a number of retainers or followers who were called their Clients, a <lb/>
            word which perhaps originally meant those who were bound to hear <lb/>
            and to obey a common head. It was a tradition that when Atta <lb/>
            Claudius the head of the great Claudian Gens, who weie Sabines, was <lb/>
            admitted among the Roman Patricians, he brought with him a large <lb/>
            body of clients to whom land was given north of the Anio, now the <lb/>
            Teverone. (Livius, 2, c. 16; Suetonius, Tiberius, c. 1.) The precise <lb/>
            relation of the early clients to their leaders is one of the most difficult <lb/>
            questions in Roman History, and much too extensive to be discussed <lb/>
            here. It was the Patron's duty to protect his clients and to give them <lb/>
            his aid and advice in all matters that required it: the clients owed to <lb/>
            the Patron respect and obedience and many duties which are tolerably <lb/>
            well ascertained. Long after the strictness of the old relation had been <lb/>
            relaxed, the name continued and some of the duties, as we see in this <lb/>
            sentence of Marius, where the Patron claimed to be exempted from <lb/>
            giving evidence against his client. In the last periods of the Republic <lb/>
            and under the Empire, Patron was sometimes simply used as Protector, <lb/>
            adviser, defender, and Client to express one who looked up to another <lb/>
            as his friend and adviser, particularly in all matters where his legal <lb/>
            rights were concerned. Great men under the later Republic some­ <lb/>
            times became the Patrons of particular states or cities, and looked <lb/>
            after their interests at Rome. We have adopted the word Client in the <lb/>
            sense of one who goes to an attorney or solicitor for his legal advice, <lb/>
            but with us the client pays for the advice, and the attorney is not <lb/>
            called his patron. A modem patron is one who patronises, protects, <lb/>
            gives his countenance to an individual, or to some association of indivi </note> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <lb/>

            Romans give to protectors) were legally excused from this <lb/>
            duty, and that the parents of Marius, and Marius him­ <lb/>
            self, originally were clients of his house. Though the <lb/>
            judices accepted the excuse as valid, Marius himself con­ <lb/>
            tradicted Herennius, and maintained that for the moment <lb/>
            when he was declared to be elected to a magistracy, he <lb/>
            became divested of the relation of client; which was not <lb/>
            exactly true, for it is not every magistracy which re­ <lb/>
            leases a man who has obtained it, and his family, from <lb/>
            the necessity of having a patron, but only those magistra­ <lb/>
            cies to which the law assigns the curule seat. However, <lb/>
            on the first days of the trial it went hard with Marius, <lb/>
            and the judices were strongly against him ; yet on the <lb/>
            last day, contrary to all expectation, he was acquitted, <lb/>
            the votes being equal.</p>
          <p>VI. During his prætorship Marius got only a moderate <lb/>
            degree of credit. But on the expiration of his office he <lb/>
            obtained by lot the further province of Iberia (Spain). <lb/>
            and it is said that during his command he cleared all the <lb/>
            robber * establishments out of his government, which was <lb/>
            still an uncivilised country in its habits and in a savage <lb/>
            state, as the Iberians had not yet ceased to consider <lb/>
            robbery as no dishonourable occupation. Though Marius <lb/>
            had now embarked in a public career, he had neither <lb/>
            wealth nor eloquence, by means of which those who then <lb/>
            held the chief power were used to manage the people. <lb/>
            But the resoluteness of his character, and his enduring <lb/>
            perseverance in toil, and his plain manner of living, got <lb/>
            him the popular favour, and he increased in estimation <note type="footnote"> duals, but frequently he merely gives his countenance or his name, that <lb/>
            being as much as can be asked from him or as much as lie will give. <lb/>
            The Clients must he distinguished from the Plebs in the early history <lb/>
            of Rome, though there can be no doubt that part of the Plebeian body <lb/>
            was gradually formed out of clients. </note><note type="footnote"> * Robbery and piracy were in like manner reckoned honourable <lb/>
            occupations by the old Greeks (Thucydides, i. 5). These old robbers <lb/>
            made no distinction between robbery and war: plunder was their object, <lb/>
            and labour they hated. So says Herodotus (v. 6). A Thracian con­ <lb/>
            sidered it a disgrace to till the ground; to live by plunder was the <lb/>
            mark of a gentleman. When people can live by plunder, there must <lb/>
            be somebody worth plundering. One object of modern civilisation is to <lb/>
            protect him who labours from the aggression of him who does not. </note> <lb/>

            and influence, so as to form a matrimonial alliance with <lb/>
            the illustrious house of the Cæsars,* with Julia, whose <lb/>
            nephew Cæsar afterwards became the greatest of the <lb/>
            Romans and in some degree imitated his relation Marius, <lb/>
            as I have told in the Life of Cæsar. There is evidence <lb/>
            both of the temperance of Marius and also of his <lb/>
            endurance, which was proved by his behaviour about a <lb/>
            surgical operation. Both his legs, it is said, had become <lb/>
            varicose,t and as .he disliked this deformity, he resolved <lb/>
            to put himself in the surgeon's hands. Accordingly he <lb/>
            presented to the surgeon one of his legs without allowing <lb/>
            himself to be bound ; and without making a single move­ <lb/>
            ment or uttering a single groan, with steady countenance <lb/>
            and in silence he endured excessive pain during the opera­ <lb/>
            tion. But when the surgeon was going to take the other <lb/>
            leg, Marius refused to present it, saying that he perceived <lb/>
            the cure was not worth the pain.</p>
          <p>VII. When Cæcilius Metellus‡ was appointed consul with <lb/>
            the command of the war against Jugurtha, he took Marius <lb/>
            with him to Libya in the capacity of legatus.§ Here <lb/>
            Marius signalised himself by great exploits and brilliant <lb/>
            success in battle, but he did not, like the rest, seek to <lb/>
            increase the glory of Metellus and to direct all his efforts <lb/>
            for the advantage of his general, but disdaining to be <lb/>
            called a legatus of Metellus, and considering that fortune <lb/>
            had offered him a most favourable opportunity and a wide <lb/>
            theatre for action, he displayed his courage on every <note type="footnote"> * This fact renders it doubtful if Marius was of such mean birth as <lb/>
            it is said. He married Julia, the sister of 0. Julius Cæsar. This <lb/>

            quently the nephew of Cams Marius. </note><note type="footnote"> t See Penny Cyclopædia. "Veins, Diseases of." Cicero (Tusculan. <lb/>

            occasion. Though the war was accompanied with many <lb/>
            hardships, he shrunk not from danger however great, and <lb/>
            he thought nothing too mean to be neglected, but in <lb/>
            prudent measures and careful foresight he surpassed all <lb/>
            the officers of his own rank, and he vied with the soldiers <lb/>
            in hard living and endurance, and thus gained their <lb/>
            affections. For certainly there is nothing which reconciles a <lb/>
            man so readily to toil as to see another voluntarily sharing <lb/>
            it with him, for thus the compulsion seems to be taken <lb/>
            away; and the most agreeable sight to a Roman soldier <lb/>
            is to see his general in his presence eating common bread <lb/>
            or sleeping on a coarse mat, or taking a hand in any <lb/>
            trench-work and fortification. Soldiers do not so much <lb/>
            admire a general who shares with them the honour and <lb/>
            the spoil, as one who participates in their toils and <lb/>
            dangers ; and they love a general who will take a part in <lb/>
            their labours more than one who indulges their licence. <lb/>
            By such conduct as this, and by gaining the affection of <lb/>
            the soldiers, Marius soon filled Libya and Rome with his <lb/>
            fame and his glory, for the soldiers wrote to their friends <lb/>
            at home and told them there would be no end to the war <lb/>
            with the barbarian, no deliverance from it, if they did <lb/>
            not elect Marius consul.</p>
          <p>VIII. These proceedings evidently caused great annoy­ <lb/>
            ance to Metellus; but the affair of Turpillius* vexed him <lb/>
            most of all. The family of Turpillius for several genera­ <lb/>
            tions had been connected with that of Metellus by friendly <lb/>
            relations, and Turpillius was then serving in the army at <lb/>
            the head of a body of engineers. It happened that he was <lb/>
            commissioned to take charge of Vaga, which was a large <lb/>
            city. Trusting for his security to the forbearance with <lb/>
            which he treated the inhabitants, and his kind and friendly <lb/>
            intercourse with them, he was thrown off his guard and <lb/>
            fell into the hands of his enemies, who admitted Jugurtha <lb/>
            into the city. Turpillius, however, was not injured, and <note type="footnote"> * The story of Turpillius is told by Sallustius (Jugurthine War, 66), <lb/>
            who speaks of his execution, but says nothing of his innocence being <lb/>
            afterwards established. The Romans had in their armies a body of <lb/>
            engineers called Fabri, and the director of the body was called Præfec­ <lb/>
            tus Fabrorum. Vaga, which Sallustius calls Vacca, was one of the <lb/>
            chief towns in Numidia. </note> <lb/>

            the citizens obtained his release and sent him away. He <lb/>
            was accordingly charged with treason, and Marius, who <lb/>
            was present at the trial as an assessor, was violent against <lb/>
            him and excited most of the rest, so that Metellus was <lb/>
            unwillingly compelled to pronounce sentence of death <lb/>
            against the man. Shortly after it appeared that the <lb/>
            charge was false, and everybody except Marius sym <lb/>
            pathised with Metellus, who was grieved at what had <lb/>
            taken place; but Marius exultingly claimed the merit of <lb/>
            the condemnation, and was shameless enough to go about <lb/>
            saying that he had fixed on Metellus a dæmon which <lb/>
            would avenge the death of the man whom it was his duty <lb/>
            to protect. This brought Metellus and Marius to open <lb/>
            enmity; and it is reported that on one occasion when <lb/>
            Marius was present, Metellus said in an insulting way, <lb/>
            " You, forsooth, my good fellow, intend to leave us and <lb/>
            make the voyage to Rome, to offer yourself for the con­ <lb/>
            sulship ; and you won't be content to be the colleague of <lb/>
            this son of mine." Now the son of Metellus* was at that <lb/>
            time a very young man. Marius however was still im­ <lb/>
            portunate to obtain leave of absence ; and Metellus, after <lb/>
            devising various pretexts for delay, at last allowed him <lb/>
            to go, when there were only twelve days left before the <lb/>
            consuls would be declared. Marius accomplished the <lb/>
            long journey from the camp to Utica, on the coast, in two <lb/>
            days and one night, and offered sacrifice before he set sail. <lb/>
            It is said that the priest told him that the deity gave <lb/>
            prognostications of success beyond all measure and all <lb/>
            expectation, and accordingly Marius set sail with high <lb/>
            hopes. In four days he crossed the sea with a favourable <lb/>
            wind, and was most joyfully received by the people, and <lb/>
            being introduced to the popular assembly by one of the <lb/>
            tribunes, he began by violent abuse of Metellus, and ended <lb/>
            with asking for the consulship and promising that he <lb/>
            would either kill Jugurtha or take him alive. <note type="footnote"> * Sallustius, who tells the same story pretty nearly in the same way <lb/>
            (Jugurth. War, c. 64), says that the son of Metellus was about twenty. <lb/>
            The insult was not one to be forgiven by a man like Marius, to be toid <lb/>
            that it would be soon enough for him to be consul three-and-twenty <lb/>
            years hence. This son is Q. Cæcilius Motellus Pius who afterwards <lb/>
            fought against Sertorius in Spain. </note> <pb n="232"/>
            </p>
          <p>IX. Being declared consul by a great majority, he imme­ <lb/>
            diately set about levying soldiers in a way contrary to <lb/>
            law and usage, by enrolling a great number of the poorer <lb/>
            sort and of slaves, though former generals had never <lb/>
            admitted men of this kind into the army, but had given <lb/>
            arms, as they would anything else that was a badge of <lb/>
            honour, only to those who had the due qualification, inas­ <lb/>
            much as every soldier was thus considered to pledge his <lb/>
            property to the State. It was not this however which <lb/>
            made Marius most odious, but his insolent and arrogant <lb/>
            expressions, which gave offence to the nobles, for he <lb/>
            publicly said that he considered his acquisition of the <lb/>
            consulship a trophy gained over the effeminacy of the <lb/>
            noble and the rich, and that what he could proudly show <lb/>
            to the people was his own wounds, not the monuments of <lb/>
            the dead or the likenesses* of others. And he would often <lb/>
            speak of the generals who had been defeated in Libya, <lb/>
            mentioning by name Bestial and Albinus, men of illustrious <lb/>
            descent indeed, but unskilled in military matters, and f or <lb/>
            want of experience unsuccessful; and he would ask his <lb/>
            hearers whether they did not think that the ancestors of <lb/>
            Bestia and Albinus would rather have left descendants <lb/>
            like himself, for they also had gained an honourable fame, <lb/>
            not by noble birth, but by their virtues and their illus­ <lb/>
            trious deeds. This was not said as a mere empty boast, <lb/>
            nor simply because he wished to make himself odious to <lb/>
            the nobles; but the people, who were delighted to hear <lb/>
            the Senate abused, and always measured the greatness of <lb/>
            a man's designs by the bigness of his words, encouraged <note type="footnote"> * The Latin word which Plutarch has translated is Imagines. These <lb/>
            Imagines were busts of wax, marble, or metal, which the Romans of <lb/>

            set of family portraits, but they were the portraits of men who had <lb/>
            enjoyed the high offices of the State. These imagines were carried in <lb/>

          <p>X. When Marina had crossed over to Libya, Metellus, <lb/>
            giving way to his jealousy, and vexed to see the crown <lb/>
            and the triumph, when he had already completed the war <lb/>
            and it only remained to seize the person of Jugurtha, taken <lb/>
            from him by another, a man too who had raised himself to <lb/>
            power by ingratitude to his benefactor, would not stay to <lb/>
            meet Marius, but privately left the country, and Rutilius, <lb/>
            one of his legati, gave up the army to the new consul. <lb/>
            But at last retribution for his conduct overtook Marius; <lb/>
            for he was deprived of the glory of his victories by Sulla, <lb/>
            just in the same way as he had deprived Metellus of his <lb/>
            credit: and how this happened I will state briefly, since <lb/>
            the particular circumstances are told more at length in the <lb/>
            Life of Sulla. Bocchus, who was king of the barbarians <lb/>
            in the interior, and the father-in-law of Jugurtha, showed <lb/>
            no great disposition to help him in his wars, because of <lb/>
            the faithlessness of Jugurtha, and also because he feared <lb/>
            the increase of his power. But when Jugurtha, who was <lb/>
            now a fugitive from place to place, made Bocchus his last <lb/>
            resource and took refuge with him, Bocchus received his <lb/>
            son-in-law more from a regard to decency, as he was a <lb/>
            suppliant, than from any goodwill, and kept him in his <lb/>
            hands; and while he openly interceded with Marius on <lb/>
            behalf of Jugurtha, and wrote to say that he would not <lb/>
            surrender him and assumed a high tone, he secretly enter. <lb/>
            tained treacherous designs against Jugurtha, and sent for <lb/>
            Lucius Sulla, who was the Quæstor of Marius, and had <lb/>
            done some service to Bocchus during the campaign. Sulla <lb/>
            confidently went to Bocchus, but the barbarian, who had <lb/>
            changed his intentions and repented of his design, for <lb/>
            several days wavered in his plan, hesitating whether he <lb/>
            should deliver up Jugurtha or keep Sulla a prisoner: at <lb/>
            last, however, ho determined to carry into effect his cri­ <lb/>
            ginal design, and surrendered Jugurtha into the hands of <lb/>
            Bulla. Thus was sown the seed of that irreconcilable and <lb/>
            violent animosity between Marius and Sulla which nearly <lb/>
            destroyed Rome: many claimed the credit of this transac­ <lb/>
            tion for Sulla on account of their dislike of Marius, and <lb/>
            Sulla himself had a seal-ring made, which he used to wear, <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            on which there was a representation of the surrender of <lb/>
            Jugurtha by Bocchus. By constantly wearing this ring <lb/>
            Sulla irritated Marius, who was an ambitious and quarrel­ <lb/>
            some man, and could endure no partner in his glory. But <lb/>
            the enemies of Marius gave SuHa most encouragement by <lb/>
            attributing to Metellus the credit of the first and best part <lb/>
            of the war, and that of the latter part and the conclusion <lb/>
            to Sulla, their object being to lower Marius in public esti­ <lb/>
            mation and to withdraw the people from their exclusive <lb/>
            attachment to him.</p>
          <p>XI. But this envy and hatred and these calumnies against <lb/>
            Marius were dissipated and removed by the danger which <lb/>
            threatened Italy from the west, as soon as the State saw <lb/>
            that she needed a great commander and had to look about <lb/>
            for a pilot whose skill should save her from such a torrent <lb/>
            of foes; for no one would allow any of the men of noble <lb/>
            birth or wealthy families to offer themselves at the Comi­ <lb/>
            tia, and Marius, in his absence from Rome, was declared <lb/>
            consul. It happened that the Romans had just received <lb/>
            intelligence of the capture of Jugurtha when the reports <lb/>
            about the Cimbri* and Teutones surprised them, and though <lb/>
            the rumours as to the numbers and strength of the invaders <lb/>
            were at first disbelieved, it afterwards appeared that they <lb/>
            fell short of the truth. Three hundred thousand armed <lb/>
            fighting men were advancing, bringing with them a much <lb/>
            larger number of women and children, in quest of land to <lb/>
            support so mighty a multitude and of cities to dwell in, <lb/>
            after the example of the Cellar before them, who took the <lb/>
            best part of Italy from the Tyrrheni and kept it. As <lb/>
            these invaders had no intercourse with other nations, and <lb/>
            had traversed an extensive tract of country, it could not <lb/>
            be ascertained who they were or where they issued from <lb/>
            to descend upon Gaul and Italy like a cloud. The most <lb/>
            probable conjecture was that they were Germanic nations <note type="footnote"> * Though much has been said on the subject, there is nothing worth <lb/>
            adding to what Plutarch tells. He gives the various opinions that he <lb/>

            belonging to those who extended as far as the northern <lb/>
            ocean ; and this opinion was founded on their great stature, <lb/>
            their blue eyes, and on the fact that the Germans designate <lb/>
            robbers by the name of Cimbri. Others thought that <lb/>
            Celtica extended in a wide and extensive tract from the <lb/>
            external sea and the subarctic regions to the rising sun <lb/>
            and the Lake Maeotis,* where it bordered on Pontic Scythia; <lb/>
            and it was from this region, as they supposed, where the <lb/>
            tribes are mingled, that these invaders came, and that they <lb/>
            did not advance in one expedition nor yet uninterruptedly, <lb/>
            but that every spring they moved forwards, fighting their <lb/>
            way, till in the course of time they traversed the whole <lb/>
            continent. Accordingly while the barbarians had several <lb/>
            names according to their respective tribes, they designated <lb/>
            the whole body by the name of Celtoscythians. But others <lb/>
            say that the Cimmerians, with whom the ancient Greeks <lb/>
            were first acquainted, were no large portion of the whole <lb/>
            nation, but merely a tribef or faction that was driven out <lb/>
            by the Scythians and passed into Asia from the Lake <lb/>
            Mæotis, under the command of Lygdamis: they further <lb/>
            say that the chief part of the Scythian nation and the most <lb/>
            warlike part lived at the very verge of the continent, on <lb/>
            the coast of the external sea, in a tract shaded, woody, <lb/>
            and totally sunless, owing to the extent and closeness of <lb/>
            the forests, which reach into the interior as far as the <lb/>
            Hercynii‡; and with respect to the heavens, their position <lb/>

            of Germany was probably covered with forest. Cæsar (Gallic War, vi. <lb/>

            the days and nights are of equal length and share the <lb/>
            year between them, which furnished Homer* with the <lb/>
            occasion for his story of Ulysses visiting the ghosts. From <lb/>
            these parts then some supposed that these barbarians came <lb/>
            against Italy, who were originally Cimmerii, but then <lb/>
            not inappropriately called Cimbri. But all this is rather <lb/>
            founded on conjecture than on sure historical evidence. <lb/>
            As to the numbers of the invaders, they are stated by many <lb/>
            authorities as above rather than below the amount that <lb/>
            has been mentioned. But their courage and daring made <lb/>
            them irresistible, and in battle they rushed forward with <lb/>
            the rapidity and violence of fire, so that no nations could <lb/>
            stand their attack, but all the people that came in their <lb/>
            way became their prey and booty, and many powerful <lb/>
            Roman armiest with their commanders, which were sta­ <lb/>
            tioned to protect Gaul north of the Alps, perished inglo­ <lb/>
            riously; and indeed these armies by their unsuccessful <lb/>
            resistance mainly contributed to direct the course of the <lb/>
            enemy against Rome. For when they had defeated those <lb/>
            who opposed them and got abundance of booty, they do­ <lb/>
            termined not to settle themselves permanently anywhere <lb/>
            till they had destroyed Rome and ravaged Italy.</p>

            literally signifies an offering or sacrifice by which the shaded of the <lb/>
            dead are called up from the lower world to answer questions that are <lb/>
            put to them. </note><note type="footnote">t In B.O. 113 the Romans first heard of the approach of the Cimbri <lb/>
            and Teutones. Cn. Papirius Carbo, one of the consuls of this year, was <lb/>
            defeated by them in lllyricum (part of Stiria), but they did not cross <lb/>
            the Alps. In B.O. 109 the consul M. Junius Silanus was defeated by <lb/>
            the Cimbri, who demanded of the Roman Senate lands to settle in: the <lb/>
            demand was refused. In B.O. 107 the consul L. Cassius Longinus fell <lb/>
            in battle against the Galli Tigurini, who inhabited a part of Switzer­ <lb/>
            land, and his army was sent under the yoke. This was while his <lb/>
            colleague Marius was carrying on the campaign against Jugurtha in <lb/>
            Africa. In B.C. 105 Cn. Manlius Maximus the consul, and Q. Servilius <lb/>
            Cæpio, proconsul, who had been consul in B.C. 106, were defeated .by <lb/>
            the Cimbri with immense slaughter, and lost both their cam pp. The <lb/>

            called Marius to the command; and he was elected consul <lb/>
            the second time, though it was contrary to a positive law <lb/>
            for a man in his absence, and without a certain interval of <lb/>
            time, to be elected again, but the people would not listen <lb/>
            to those who made any opposition to the election. For <lb/>
            they considered that this would not be the first time that <lb/>
            the law had given way to convenience, and that the <lb/>
            present was as good an occasion for such an irregularity <lb/>
            as the election of Scipio * as consul at a time when they <lb/>
            were under no apprehension about the ruin of Rome, <lb/>
            but merely wished to destroy Carthage. Accordingly <lb/>
            these reasons prevailed, and Marius, after crossing the <lb/>
            sea with his army to Rome, received the consulship, and <lb/>
            celebrated his triumph on the calends of January, which <lb/>
            with the Romans is the beginning of the year, and ex­ <lb/>
            hibited to them a sight they never expected to see, <lb/>
            Jugurtha in chains; for no one had ever ventured to hope <lb/>
            that the Romans could conquer their enemies while he <lb/>
            was alive; so dexterous was Jugurtha in turning all <lb/>
            events to the best advantage, and so much courage did he <lb/>
            combine with great cunning. But it is said that being <lb/>
            led in the triumph made him lose his senses. After the <lb/>
            triumph he was thrown into prison, and while some were <lb/>
            tearing his clothes from his body, others who were anxious <lb/>
            to secure his golden ear-rings pulled them off and the lobe <lb/>
            of the ear with them; in this plight being thrust down <lb/>
            naked into a deep hole, in his frenzy, with a grinning <lb/>
            laugh, he cried out, 0 Hercules, how cold your bath is! <lb/>
            After struggling with famine for six days and to the last <lb/>
            moment clinging to the wish to preserve his life, he paid <lb/>
            the penalty due to his monstrous crimes. It is said that <lb/>
            there were carried in the triumphal procession three <lb/>
            thousand and seven pounds of gold, of silver uncoined five <lb/>
            thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, and in coined <note type="footnote"> * Scipio Africanus the younger was elected consul B.O. 147 when <lb/>
            he was thirty-seven years of age, the law as to age being for that <lb/>
            occasion not enforced. There was an old Plebiscitum (law passed in <lb/>
            the Comitia Tributa) which enacted that no man should hold the same <lb/>
            magistracy without an interval of ten full years. (Livius. 7, c. 42; <lb/>
            10, c. 13). The first instance of the law being suspended was in <lb/>
            the case of Q. Fabius Maximus. One of Sulla's laws re-enacted of <lb/>
            confirmed the old law. </note> <lb/>

            money two hundred and eighty-seven thousand drachmas. <lb/>
            After the procession Marius assembled the Senate in the <lb/>
            Capitol, and either through inadvertence or vulgar exulta­ <lb/>
            tion at his good fortune he entered the place of meeting <lb/>
            in his triumphal dress. But observing that the Senate <lb/>
            took offence at this, he went out, and putting on the <lb/>
            ordinary robe with the purple border, he returned to the <lb/>
            assembly.</p>
          <p>XIII. On his expedition to meet the Cimbri, Marius con­ <lb/>
            tinually exercised his forces in various ways in running <lb/>
            and in forced marches; he also compelled every man to <lb/>
            carry all his baggage and to prepare his own food, in <lb/>
            consequence of which men who were fond of toil, and <lb/>
            promptly and silently did what they were ordered, were <lb/>
            called Marian mules. Some, however, think that this <lb/>
            name had a different origin; as follows :-When Scipio <lb/>
            was blockading Numantia, he wished to inspect not only <lb/>
            the arms and the horses, but also the mules and waggons, <lb/>
            in order to see in what kind of order and condition the <lb/>
            soldiers kept them. Marius accordingly produced his <lb/>
            horse, which he had kept in excellent condition with his <lb/>
            own hand, and also a mule, which for good appearance, <lb/>
            docility, and strength far surpassed all the rest. The <lb/>
            general was much pleased with the beasts of Marius <lb/>
            and often spoke about them, which gave rise to the scoff­ <lb/>
            ing epithet of Marian mule, when the subject of com­ <lb/>
            mendation was a persevering, enduring, and labour-loving <lb/>
            man.</p>
          <p>XIV. Marius was favoured by a singular piece of good <lb/>
            fortune; for there was a reflux in the course of the <lb/>
            barbarians, and the torrent flowed towards Iberia before <lb/>
            it turned to Italy, which gave Marius time to discipline <lb/>
            the bodies of his men and to confirm their courage; and <lb/>
            what was most of all, it gave the soldiers an opportunity <lb/>
            of knowing what kind of a man their general was. For <lb/>
            the first impression created by his sternness and by his <lb/>
            inexorable severity in punishing, was changed into an <lb/>
            opinion of the justice and utility of his discipline when <lb/>
            they had been trained to avoid all cause of offence and all <lb/>
            breach of order; and the violence of his temper, the <lb/>
            harshness of his voice, and ferocious expression of his <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            countenance, when the soldiers became familiarised with <lb/>
            them, appeared no longer formidable to them, but only <lb/>
            terrific to their enemies. But his strict justice in-all matters <lb/>
            that came before him for judgment pleased the soldiers <lb/>
            most of all; and of this the following instance is mentioned. <lb/>
            Caius Lusius, who was a nephew of Marius, and was an <lb/>
            officer in the army, was in other respects a man of no <lb/>
            bad character, but fond of beautiful youths. This Caius <lb/>
            conceived a passion for one of the young men who served <lb/>
            under him, by name Trebonius, and had often ineffectually <lb/>
            attempted to seduce him. At last Caius one night sent a <lb/>
            servant with orders to bring Trebonius; the young man <lb/>
            came, for he could not refuse to obey the summons, and <lb/>
            was introduced into the tent; but when Caius attempted <lb/>
            to use violence towards him, he drew his sword and killed <lb/>
            him. Marius was not present when this happened, but <lb/>
            on his arrival he brought Trebonius to trial. There were <lb/>
            many to join in supporting the accusation, and not one to <lb/>
            speak in his favour, but Trebonius boldly came forward <lb/>
            and told the whole story; and he produced witnesses who <lb/>
            proved that he had often resisted the importunities of <lb/>
            Lusius, and that though great offers had been made, he <lb/>
            had never prostituted himself; on which Marius, admir­ <lb/>
            ing his conduct, ordered a crown to be brought, such as <lb/>
            was conferred for noble deeds according to an old Roman <lb/>
            fashion, and he took it and put it on the head of Trebonius <lb/>
            as a fit reward for so noble an act at a time when good <lb/>
            examples were much needed. The news of this, reaching <lb/>
            Rome, contributed in no small degree to the consulship <lb/>
            being conferred on Marius for the third time; the barba­ <lb/>
            rians also were expected about the spring of the year, and <lb/>
            the Romans did not wish to try the issue of a battle with <lb/>
            them under any other commander. However, the bar­ <lb/>
            barians did not come so soon as they were expected, and <lb/>
            the period of the consulship of Marius again expired. As <lb/>
            the Comitia were at hand, and his colleague had died, <lb/>
            Marius came to Rome, leaving Manius Aquilius in the <lb/>
            command of the army. There were many candidates of <lb/>
            great merit for the consulship, but Lucius Saturninus, <lb/>
            one of the tribunes, who had most influence with the <lb/>
            people, was gained over by Marius; and in his harangues <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            he advised them to elect Marius consul. Marius indeed <lb/>
            affected to decline the honour, and begged to be excused; <lb/>
            he said he did not wish for it; on which Saturninus called <lb/>
            him a traitor to his country for refusing the command <lb/>
            at so critical a time. Now though it was apparent that <lb/>
            Saturninus was playing a part at the bidding of Marius, <lb/>
            and in such a way that nobody was deceived, still the <lb/>
            many seeing that the circumstances required a man of <lb/>
            his energy and good fortune, voted for the fourth consulship <lb/>
            of Marius, and gave him for colleague Catulus Lutatius, a <lb/>
            man who was esteemed by the nobility and not disliked <lb/>
            by the people.</p>
          <p>XV. Marius, hearing that the enemy was near, quickly <lb/>
            crossed the Alps, and established a fortified camp near <lb/>
            the river Rhodanus* (Rhône), which he supplied with <lb/>
            abundance of stores, that he might not be compelled <lb/>
            against his judgment to fight a battle for want of pro­ <lb/>
            visions. The conveyance of the necessary stores for the <lb/>
            army, which hitherto was tedious and expensive on the side <lb/>
            of the sea, he rendered easy and expeditious. The mouths <lb/>
            of the Rhodanus, owing to the action of the waves, <lb/>
            received a great quantity of mud and sand, mixed with <lb/>
            large masses of clay, which were formed into banks by the <lb/>
            force of the water, and the entrance of the river was thus <lb/>
            made difficult and laborious and shallow for the vessels that <lb/>
            brought supplies. As the army had nothing to do, Marius <lb/>
            brought the soldiers here and commenced a great cut, into <lb/>
            which he diverted a large part of the river, and, by making <lb/>
            the new channel terminate at a convenient point on the coast, <lb/>
            he gave it a deep outlet which had water enough for large <lb/>
            vessels, and was smooth and safe against wind and wave. <lb/>
            This cut still bears the name of Marius. The barbarians had <lb/>
            now divided themselves into two bodies, and it fell to the <note type="footnote"> * This canal of Marina is mentioned by Strabo (p. 183) and other <lb/>
            ancient writers. The eastern branch of the Rhone runs from Arel ite <lb/>

            branch about twenty Roman miles below Arles (which did not then <lb/>
            exist), and entered the sea between the mouth of this branch and <lb/>
            Maritima, now Martigues. The length of the canal of Marius might <lb/>
            be about twelve Roman miles. Marseilles is east of Martigues. <lb/>

            lot of the Cimbri to march through the country of the <lb/>
            Norici,* over the high land against Catulus, and to force <lb/>
            that passage: the Teutones and Ambrones were to march <lb/>
            through the Ligurian country along the sea to meet Marius. <lb/>
            Now on the part of the Cimbri there was some loss of time <lb/>
            and delay; but the Teutones and Ambrones set out forth­ <lb/>
            with, and speedily traversing the space which separated <lb/>
            them from the Romans, they made their appearance in <lb/>
            numbers countless, hideous in aspect, and in language <lb/>
            and the cries they uttered unlike any other people. They <lb/>
            covered a large part of the plain, where they pitched their <lb/>
            tents and challenged Marius to battle.</p>
          <p>XVL Marius cared not for all this, but he kept his soldiers <lb/>
            within their entrenchments and severely rebuked those <lb/>
            who made a display of their courage, calling such as <lb/>
            through passion were eager to break out and fight, traitors <lb/>
            to their country; he said it was not triumphs or trophies <lb/>
            which should now be the object of their ambition, but how <lb/>
            they should ward off so great a cloud and tempest of war, <lb/>
            and secure the safety of Italy. This was the way in which <lb/>
            he addressed the commanders in particular and the officers. <lb/>
            The soldiers he used to station on the rampart in turns, <lb/>
            and bid them look at the enemy, and thus he accustomed <lb/>
            them to the aspect of the barbarians and their strange and <lb/>
            savage shouts, and to make themselves acquainted with <lb/>
            their armour and movements, so that in course of time what <lb/>
            appeared formidable to their imagination would become <lb/>
            familiar by being often seen. For it was the opinion of <lb/>
            Marius that mere strangeness adds many imaginary <lb/>
            dangers to real danger; but that through familiarity even <lb/>
            real dangers lose their terrors. Now the daily sight of the <lb/>
            enemy not only took away somewhat of the first alarm, but <lb/>
            the threats of the barbarians and their intolerable arrogance <lb/>
            roused the courage of the Roman soldiers and inflamed <lb/>
            their passions, for the enemy plundered and devastated all <note type="footnote"> * The movements of the barbarians are not clearly stated. It <lb/>
            appears from what follows that the Cimbri entered Italy on the north- <lb/>
            east over the Noric Alps, for their march brought them to the hanks of <lb/>
            the Adige. Florus says that they came by the defiles of Tridentum <lb/>
            (Trento). The Teutones, if they marched through the Ligurian <lb/>
            country along the sea to meet Marina, who was near Marseilles, must <lb/>
            have come along the Riviera of Genoa. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>

            the country around, and often attacked the ramparts with <lb/>
            much insolence and temerity, so that the words and <lb/>
            indignant expressions of the soldiers were repeated to <lb/>
            Marius. The soldiers asked, " If Marius had discovered <lb/>
            any cowardice in them, that he kept them from battle, <lb/>
            like women under lock and key ? Why should we not, <lb/>
            like free men, ask him whether he is waiting for others <lb/>
            to fight for Italy, and intends to employ us always as <lb/>
            labourers when there may be occasion to dig canals, to <lb/>
            clear out mud, and to divert the course of rivers ? It was <lb/>
            for this, as it seems, that he disciplined us in so many <lb/>
            toils; and these are the exploits of his consulship, which <lb/>
            he will exhibit to the citizens when he returns to Rome. <lb/>
            Does he fear the fate of Carbo and Cæpio, who were <lb/>
            defeated by the enemy ? But they were far inferior to <lb/>
            Marius in reputation and merit, and they were at the head <lb/>
            of much inferior armies. And it is better to do some­ <lb/>
            thing, even if we perish like them, than to Bit here and <lb/>
            see the lands of our allies plundered."</p>
          <p>XVII. Marius, who was pleased to hear such expressions <lb/>
            as these, pacified the soldiers by saying that he did not <lb/>
            distrust them, but was waiting for the time and the place <lb/>
            of victory pursuant to certain oracles. And in fact he <lb/>
            carried about with him in a litter, with great tokens of <lb/>
            respect, a Syrian woman named Martha,* who was said to <lb/>
            possess the gift of divination, and he sacrificed pursuant <lb/>
            to her directions. This woman had formerly applied to <lb/>
            the Senate, and offered to foretell future events, but her <lb/>
            proposal was rejected. Having got access to the women, <lb/>
            she allowed them to make trial of her skill; and especially <lb/>
            on one occasion, when she sat at the feet of the wife of <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch calls her a Syrian. Martha may have been a Syrian <lb/>
            name, as well as a Jewish name. Syrians and Jews flocked to Rome <lb/>
            in great numbers under the later Republic and the Empire, and got <lb/>
            their living in various ways not always reputable. The Jews at <lb/>
            Rome used to cause disturbances in the popular assemblies in Cicero's <lb/>
            time. (Cio. Pro Flacco, o. 28.) Jews and Syrians are often mentioned <lb/>
            together by the Roman writers. The Jews at Rome were greatly <lb/>
            troubled at the assassination of the Dictator Cæsar, and they crowded <lb/>
            round the place where the body was burnt for nights in succession. <lb/>
            Cæsar had rather favoured the nation for their services in the <lb/>
            Alexandrine War. (Suetonius, Cæsar, c. 84, and Casaubon's note.) </note> <lb/>

            Marius, she was successful in foretelling what gladiators <lb/>
            would win, and this led to her being sent to Marius, who <lb/>
            was much struck with her skill. She generally accompanied <lb/>
            the army in a litter, and assisted at the sacrifices in a <lb/>
            double purple robe fastened with a clasp, and carrying a <lb/>
            spear wreathed with ribands and chaplets. This exhibition <lb/>
            made many doubt whether Marius produced the woman <lb/>
            in public because he really believed in her, or whether <lb/>
            he merely pretended to do so, and played a part in the <lb/>
            matter. But the affair of the vultures, which Alexander * <lb/>
            of Myndus has related, is certainly wonderful. Two vul­ <lb/>
            tures were always seen hovering about the army before a <lb/>
            victory, and accompanying it; they were known by brass <lb/>
            rings round their necks, for the soldiers had caught the <lb/>
            birds, and after putting on the rings had let them go. <lb/>
            Ever after this time as the soldiers recognised the birds, <lb/>
            they saluted them; and whenever the birds appeared <lb/>
            on the occasion of the army moving, the soldiers re­ <lb/>
            joiced, as they were confident of success. Though there <lb/>
            were many signs about this time, all of them were of an <lb/>
            ordinary kind, except what was reported from Ameria and <lb/>
            Tuder, two towns of Italy, where at night there was the <lb/>
            appearance in the heavens of fiery spears and shields, <lb/>
            which at first moved about in various directions, and then <lb/>
            closed together, exhibiting the attitudes and movements <lb/>
            of men in battle; at last part gave way, and the rest <lb/>
            pressed on in pursuit, and all moved away to the west. It <lb/>
            happened that about the same time Batakes, the priest of <lb/>
            the Great Mother, came from Pessinus,t and reported that <note type="footnote"> * He wrote on Natural History; among other things, a History of <lb/>
            Birds, from which this story is probably taken. There is evidently an <lb/>

            In the second Punic War the Romans sent ambassadors to Pessinus, <lb/>
            and got permission to convey to Rome the Great Mother of the Gods, <lb/>
            who was a sacred stone. The Sibylline Books had declared that when <lb/>
            a foreign enemy was in Italy, he could be driven out, if the Idæan <lb/>

            in the temple of Victory. (Livius, 29, c. 10, &amp;c.) Plutarch does not <lb/>

            the goddess from her shrine had declared to him that <lb/>
            victory and the advantage in war would be on the side <lb/>
            of the Romans. The Senate accepted the announcement <lb/>
            and voted a temple to be built to the goddess in com­ <lb/>
            memoration of the anticipated victory; but when Batakes <lb/>
            presented himself to the popular assembly with the inten­ <lb/>
            tion of making the same report there, Aulus Pompeius, <lb/>
            one of the tribunes, stopped him, calling him an impostor, <lb/>
            and contumeliously driving him from the Rostra ; which <lb/>
            however contributed to gain most credit for the man's <lb/>
            assertions. For on the separation of the assembly, Aulus <lb/>
            had no sooner returned to his house than he was seized <lb/>
            with so violent a fever that he died within seven days; <lb/>
            and the matter was notorious all through Rome and the <lb/>
            subject of much talk.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Now Marius keeping quiet, the Tentones at­ <lb/>
            tempted to storm his camp, but as many of them were <lb/>
            struck by the missiles from the rampart and some lost their <lb/>
            lives, they resolved to march forward with the expecta­ <lb/>
            tion of safely crossing the Alps. Accordingly taking their <lb/>
            baggage, they passed by the Roman camp. Then indeed <lb/>
            some notion could be formed of their numbers by the <lb/>
            length of their line and the time which they took to <lb/>
            march by; for it is said that they continued to move <note type="footnote"> the same time, for there is no account of her leaving Rome after she <lb/>
            was taken there. The annual celebration called Megalesia, that is, <lb/>
            the festival of the Great Mother, was instituted at Rome in honour of <lb/>
            the goddess, and celebrated in the spring. (Herodianus, i. 32, &amp;c.) <lb/>
            It was a tradition that the stone fell from the skies at Pessinus. There <lb/>
            was another great stone in Syria (Herodianus, v. 5), in the temple of <lb/>
            the Sun, which was worshipped: the stone was round in the lower <lb/>
            part, and gradually tapered upwards; the colour was black, and the <lb/>
            people paid that it fell from heaven. It is probable that these stones <lb/>
            were aerolites, the falling of which is often recorded in ancient writers, <lb/>
            and now established beyond all doubt by repeated observation in <lb/>
            modern times. (See Penny Cyclopædia, “Aerolites.”) There is a <lb/>
            large specimen in the British Museum. The immediate cause of the <lb/>
            Romans sending for the Great Mother was a heavy bhower of stones <lb/>
            at Rome, an occurrence which in those days was very common. One <lb/>
            might have supposed tl.at one of the Roman aerolites would have <lb/>
            answered as well as the btone of Pessinus, but the bt -ne of Pessinus <lb/>
            had the advantage of being consecrated by tine and coming from <unclear/> <lb/>
            distance, and it was probably a large stone. Cf. Pluto Lys. ch. 12. </note> <lb/>

            past the encampment of Marius for six days without inter­ <lb/>
            ruption. As they passed along, they asked the Romans <lb/>
            with a laugh, if they had any message to send to their <lb/>
            wives, for they should soon be with them. When the <lb/>
            barbarians had marched by and advanced some distance, <lb/>
            Marius also broke up his camp and followed close after <lb/>
            them, always halting near the enemy, but carefully <lb/>
            fortifying his camp and making his position strong in <lb/>
            front, so that he could pass the night in safety. Thus <lb/>
            advancing, the two armies came to the Aquae Sextiæ,* <lb/>
            from which a short march would bring them into the <lb/>
            region of the Alps. Accordingly Marius prepared for <lb/>
            battle here, and he selected a position which was strong <lb/>
            enough, but ill-supplied with water, with a view, as it is <lb/>
            said, of thereby exciting his soldiers to come to an engage­ <lb/>
            ment. However this may be, when some of them were <lb/>
            complaining and saying they should suffer from thirst, he <lb/>
            pointed to a stream which ran near the barbarian camp, <lb/>
            and said they might get drink from there, but the price <lb/>
            was blood. Why then, they replied, don't you forthwith <lb/>
            lead us against the enemy, while our blood is still moist ? <lb/>
            Marius calmly replied, “ We must first secure our camp."</p>
          <p>XIX. The soldiers obeyed unwillingly. In the mean­ <lb/>
            time the camp servants, having no water for themselves <lb/>
            or their beasts, went down in a body to the river, some <lb/>
            with axes and hatchets, and others taking swords and <lb/>
            spears, together with their pitchers, resolving to have <note type="footnote"> * This is Aix, about eighteen Roman miles north of Marseilles. <lb/>

            water, even if they fought for it. At first-a few only of <lb/>
            the enemy engaged with them, for the main body of the <lb/>
            army were eating after bathing, and some were still <lb/>
            bathing. For a spring of warm water bursts from the <lb/>
            ground here, and the Romans surprised some of the bar­ <lb/>
            barians who were enjoying themselves and making merry <lb/>
            in this pleasant place. The shouts brought more of the <lb/>
            barbarians to the spot, and Marius had great difficulty <lb/>
            in checking his men any longer, as they were afraid they <lb/>
            should lose their slaves, and the bravest part of the enemy, <lb/>
            who had formerly defeated the Romans under Manlius <lb/>
            and Cæpio (these were the Ambrones, who were above <lb/>
            thirty thousand in number), had sprung up and were <lb/>
            running to their arms, Though full of food and excited <lb/>
            and inflamed with wine, they did not advance in disorderly <lb/>
            or frantic haste, nor utter confused shouts, but striking <lb/>
            their arms to a certain measure, and advancing all in <lb/>
            regular line, they often called out their name Ambrones, <lb/>
            either to encourage one another or to terrify the Romans <lb/>
            by this announcement. The Ligurians,* who were the <lb/>
            first of the Italic people to go down to battle with them, <lb/>
            hearing their shouts, and understanding what they said, <lb/>
            responded by calling out their old national name, which <lb/>
            was the same, for the Ligurians also call themselves <lb/>
            Ambrones when they refer to their origin. Thus the <lb/>
            shouts were continual on both sides before they came to <lb/>
            close quarters, and as the respective commanders joined <lb/>
            in the shouts, and at first vied with one another which <lb/>
            should call out loudest, the cries stimulated and roused <lb/>
            the courage of the men. Now the Ambrones were sepa­ <lb/>
            rated by the stream, for they could not all cross and get <lb/>
            into order of battle before the Ligurians, who advanced <lb/>

            were cut down in the stream, where they were crowded <lb/>
            upon one another, and the river. was filled with blood <lb/>
            and dead bodies; and those who made their way across, <lb/>
            not venturing to face about, were smitten by the Romans <lb/>
            till they reached their camp and the waggons in their <lb/>
            flight. There the women meeting them with swords and <lb/>
            axes, with horrid furious yells, attempted to drive back <lb/>
            both the fugitives and their pursuers, the fugitives as <lb/>
            traitors and the pursuers as their enemies, mingling <lb/>
            among the combatants, and with their bare hands tearing <lb/>
            from the Romans their shields, laying hold of their <lb/>
            swords, and enduring wounds and gashes till they fell, in <lb/>
            spirit unvanquished. In this manner, it is said that the <lb/>
            battle on the river was brought about rather from accident <lb/>
            than any design on the part of the commander.</p>
          <p>XX. After destroying many of the Ambrones, the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans retreated and night came on; yet this great success <lb/>
            was not followed, as is usual on such occasions, by pæans <lb/>
            of victory, and drinking in the tents, and merriment over <lb/>
            supper, and what is sweetest of all to men who have won <lb/>
            a victory, gentle sleep, but the Romans spent that night <lb/>
            of all others in fear and alarm. For their camp had nei­ <lb/>
            ther palisade nor rampart, and there were still left many <lb/>
            thousands of the enemy, and all night long they heard the <lb/>
            lamentation of the Ambrones who had escaped and joined <lb/>
            the rest of the barbarians, and it was not like the weeping <lb/>
            and groaning of men, but a howl resembling that of wild <lb/>
            beasts; and a bellowing mingled with threats and cries <lb/>
            of sorrow proceeding from such mighty numbers, re-echoed <lb/>
            from the surrounding mountains and the banks of the <lb/>
            river. A frightful noise filled the whole plain, and the <lb/>
            Romans were alarmed, and even Marius himself was dis­ <lb/>
            turbed, expecting a disorderly and confused battle in the <lb/>
            night. However, the enemy made no attack either on <lb/>
            that night or the following day, but they were occupied <lb/>
            in arranging their forces and making preparations. In <lb/>
            the meantime, as the position of the enemy was backed <lb/>
            by sloping hills and deep ravines shaded with trees, Marius <note type="footnote"> * The Lar according to D'Anville. not the Arc. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            sent there Claudius Marcellus, with three thousand heavy- <lb/>
            armed soldiers, with instructions to lie concealed in ambush, <lb/>
            and to appear on the rear of the barbarians when the <lb/>
            battle was begun. The rest of the army, who supped in <lb/>
            good time and got a night's rest, he drew up at daybreak <lb/>
            in front of the camp, and ordered the cavalry to advance <lb/>
            into the plain. The Teutones, observing this, would not <lb/>
            wait for the Romans to come down and fight with them <lb/>
            on fair ground, but with all speed and in passion they took <lb/>
            to their arms and advanced up the hill. Marius sent his <lb/>
            officers to every part of the army, with orders to the soldiers <lb/>
            to stand firm in their ranks till the enemy came within <lb/>
            the reach of their spears, which they were to discharge, <lb/>
            and then to draw their swords, and drive against the bar­ <lb/>
            barians with their shields; for as the ground was unfavour­ <lb/>
            able to the enemy, their blows would have no force, and <lb/>
            their line no strength, owing to the unevenness of the <lb/>
            surface, which would render their footing unstable and <lb/>
            wavering. The advice which he gave to his soldiers he <lb/>
            showed that he was the first to put in practice; for in all <lb/>
            martial training Marius was inferior to none, and in <lb/>
            courage he left all far behind him.</p>
          <p>XXI. The Romans accordingly awaiting the enemy's <lb/>
            attack, and coming to close quarters with them, checked <lb/>
            their advance up the hill, and the barbarians, being hard <lb/>
            pressed, gradually retreated to the plain, and while those <lb/>
            in the van were rallying on the level ground, there was a <lb/>
            shout and confusion in the rear. For Marcellus had not <lb/>
            let the critical moment pass by, but when the shouts rose <lb/>
            above the hills, bidding his men spring from their ambush <lb/>
            at a rapid pace and with loud shouts he fell on the enemy's <lb/>
            rear and began to cut them down. Those in the rear <lb/>
            communicating the alarm to those in front of them, put <lb/>
            the whole army into confusion, and after sustaining this <lb/>
            double attack for no long time, they broke their ranks and <lb/>
            fled. In the pursuit the Romans took prisoners and killed <lb/>
            to the number of above one hundred thousand :* they also <lb/>
            took their tents, waggons, and property, all which, with <note type="footnote"> * Statements of numbers killed are not worth much, even in any <lb/>
            modern engagements. Velleius (ii, 12) makes the number of barbarian <lb/>
            who fell in both battles above 150,000. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            the exception of what was pilfered, was given to Marius, <lb/>
            by the unanimous voice of the soldiers. But though he <lb/>
            received so magnificent a present, it was thought that he <lb/>
            got nothing at all proportioned to his services, considering <lb/>
            the magnitude of the danger. Some authorities do not <lb/>
            agree with the statement as to the gift of the spoil, nor <lb/>
            yet about the number of the slain. However, they say <lb/>
            that the people of Massalia* made fences round their vine­ <lb/>
            yards with the bones, and that the soil, after the bodies <lb/>
            had rotted and the winter rains had fallen, was so ferti­ <lb/>
            lised and saturated with the putrefied matter which sank <lb/>
            down into it, that it produced a most unusual crop in the <lb/>
            next season, and so confirmed the opinion of Archilochust <lb/>
            that the land is fattened by human bodies. They say that <lb/>
            extraordinary rains generally follow great battles, whether <lb/>
            it is that some divine power purifies the ground, and <lb/>
            drenches it with waters from heaven, or that the blood and <lb/>
            putrefaction send up a moist and heavy vapour which con­ <lb/>
            denses the atmosphere, which is lightly moved and readily <lb/>
            changed to the greatest degree from the smallest cause.</p>
          <p>XXII. After the battle, Marius caused to be collected <lb/>
            the arms and spoils of the barbarians which were con­ <lb/>
            spicuous for ornament, and unbroken, and suited to make <lb/>
            a show in his triumphal procession : all the rest he piled <lb/>
            up in a great heap, for the celebration of a splendid <lb/>
            religious festival. The soldiers were already standing by <lb/>
            in their armour, with chaplets on their heads, and Marius <lb/>
            having put on the robe with the purple border, and <lb/>
            fastened it up about him in the Roman fashion, had taken <lb/>
            a burning torch, and holding it up to heaven with both <lb/>
            his hands, was going to set fire t to the heap, when some <lb/>
            friends were seen riding quickly towards him, which <lb/>
            caused a deep silence and general expectation. When <note type="footnote"> * The Romans called it Massilia; now Marseilles. It was an old <lb/>

            of Massilia aided the Romans in these battles and that Marius made <lb/>
            them a present of the cut which he had formed from the Rhone to the <lb/>
            sea, which the Massilians turned to profit by levying a toll on those <lb/>

            the horsemen were near, they leaped down and greeted <lb/>
            Marius with the news that he was elected consul for the <lb/>
            fifth time, and they delivered him letters to this effect. <lb/>
            This cause of great rejoicing being added to the celebra­ <lb/>
            tion of the victory, the army transported with delight sent <lb/>
            forth one universal shout, accompanied with the noise <lb/>
            and clatter of their arms, and the officers crowned Marius <lb/>
            afresh with a wreath of bay, on which he set fire to the <lb/>
            heap, and completed the ceremony.</p>
          <p>XXIII. But that power which permits no great good <lb/>
            fortune to give a pleasure untempered and pure, and <lb/>
            diversifies human life with a mixture of evil and of good <lb/>
            -be it Fortune * or Nemesis, or the necessary nature of <lb/>
            things-in a few days brought to Marius intelligence <lb/>
            about his companion in command, Catulus, involving <lb/>
            Rome again in alarm and tempest, like a cloud which <lb/>
            overcasts a clear and serene sky. For Catulus, whose <lb/>
            commission was to oppose the Cimbri, determined to give <lb/>
            up the defence of the passes of the Alps, for fear that he <lb/>
            might weaken his force if he were obliged to divide it too <lb/>
            much. Accordingly he forthwith descended into the <lb/>
            plains of Italy, and placing the river Atiso t (Adige) in <lb/>
            his front, strongly fortified a position on each side of the <lb/>
            river, to hinder the enemy from crossing it; and he also <lb/>
            threw a bridge over the river, in order that he might be <lb/>
            enabled to support those on the farther side, if the bar­ <lb/>
            barians should make their way through the passes and <lb/>
            attack the forts. The enemy had so much contempt for <lb/>
            the Romans and such confidence, that, with the view <lb/>
            rather of displaying their strength and courage than <lb/>
            because it was necessary, they endured the snow-storms <lb/>
            without any covering, and made their way through the <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch often uses the word Fortune (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τύχη</foreign>), the meaning of <lb/>

            prosperity and its attendant excessive pride and arrogance; she <lb/>
            bumbles those who have been elevated too high, tames their pride <lb/>

            snow and ice to the summits of the mountains, when, <lb/>
            placing their broad shields under them, they slid down <lb/>
            the slippery precipices over the huge rocks. When they <lb/>
            had encamped near the river, and examined the ford, they <lb/>
            began to dam up the stream, and tearing up the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring hills, like the giants of old, they carried whole <lb/>
            trees with their roots, fragments of rock, and mounds of <lb/>
            earth into the river, and stopped its course ; they also let <lb/>
            heavy weights float down the stream, which drove against <lb/>
            the piles that supported the bridge and shook it by the <lb/>
            violence of the blows; all which so terrified the Romans, <lb/>
            that most of them deserted the large encampment and <lb/>
            took to flight. Then Catulus, like a good and perfect <lb/>
            general, showed that he valued the reputation of his <lb/>
            countrymen more than his own. Not being able to induce <lb/>
            his soldiers to stand, and seeing that they were making <lb/>
            off in alarm, he ordered the eagle * to be moved, and <lb/>
            running to those who were first in the retreat, he put <lb/>
            himself at their head, wishing the disgrace to fall on <lb/>
            himself and not on his country, and that the army should <lb/>
            not appear to be flying, but to be following their general <lb/>
            in his retreat. The barbarians attacked and took the fort <lb/>
            on the farther side of the Atiso, though the Roman <lb/>
            soldiers defended it with the utmost bravery and in a <lb/>
            manner worthy of their country. Admiring their courage, <lb/>
            the barbarians let them go on conditions which were <lb/>
            sworn to upon the brazen bull, which was taken after <lb/>
            the battle, and, it is said, was conveyed to the house of <lb/>
            Catulus as the first spoils of the victory. The country <lb/>
            being now undefended, the barbarians scoured it in every <lb/>
            direction and laid it waste.</p>
          <p>XXIV. After this Marius was called to Rome. On his <lb/>
            arrival it was generally expected that he would celebrate <lb/>
            his triumph, and the Senate had without any hesitation <lb/>
            voted him one ; but he refused it, either because he did <lb/>
            not wish to deprive his soldiers and his companions in <note type="footnote"> * The Eagle, Aquila, was the Roman standard in use at this time. <lb/>
            Formerly the Romans had five symbols for their standards, the eagle, <lb/>
            wolf, minotaur, horse, and wild boar, all of which were appropriated <lb/>
            to respective divisions of the army. Marius in this Cimbrian war did <lb/>
            away with all of them except the eagle. (Plinius, N. H. x. 4.) </note><lb/>

            arms of the honour that was due to them, or because he <lb/>
            wished to give the people confidence in the present emer­ <lb/>
            gency by intrusting to the Fortune of the State the glory <lb/>
            of his first victory, with the confident hope that she would <lb/>
            return it to him ennobled by a second. Having said what <lb/>
            was suitable to the occasion, he set out to join Catulus, <lb/>
            whom he encouraged, and at the same time he summoned <lb/>
            his soldiers from Gaul. On the arrival of the troops, <lb/>
            Marius crossed the Eridanus (Po), and endeavoured to <lb/>
            keep the barbarians from that part of Italy which lay <lb/>
            south of the river. The Cimbri declined a battle, because, <lb/>
            as they said, they were waiting for the Teutones, and <lb/>
            wondered they were so long in coming; but it is doubt­ <lb/>
            ful whether they were still really ignorant of their <lb/>
            destruction or merely pretended not to believe it. How­ <lb/>
            ever, they handled most cruelly those who brought the <lb/>
            report of the defeat; and they sent to Marius to demand <lb/>
            land for themselves and their brethren, and a sufficient <lb/>
            number of cities for their abode. On Marius asking the <lb/>
            ambassadors of the Cimbri whom they meant by their <lb/>
            brethren, and being told they were the Teutones, all <lb/>
            the Romans who were present burst out in a laugh, but <lb/>
            Marius, with a sneer, replied, " Don't trouble yourself <lb/>
            about your brethren: they have land, and they shall have <lb/>
            it for ever, for we have given it to them." The ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors, who understood his irony, fell to abusing him, and <lb/>
            threatened that the Cimbri would forthwith have their <lb/>
            revenge, and the Teutones too, as soon as they should <lb/>
            arrive. " They are here already," said Marius ; " and it <lb/>
            won't be right for you to go before you have embraced <lb/>
            your brethren." Saying this he ordered the kings of the <lb/>
            Teutones to be produced in their chains; for they were <lb/>
            taken in the Alps in their flight by the Sequani.*</p>
          <p>XXV. On this being reported to the Cimbri, they <lb/>
            forthwith advanced against Marius, who however kept <note type="footnote"> * The Sequani were a Gallic people who were separated from the <lb/>
            Helvetii by the range of the Jura, on the west side of which their terri­ <lb/>

            iii. 3) mentions Teutobocus as the name of a king who was taken by the <lb/>
            Romans and appeared in the triumph of Marius; he was a man of such <lb/>
            prodigious stature that he towered above his own trophies which were <lb/>
            carried in the procession. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            quiet and remained in his camp. It is said that it was on <lb/>
            the occasion of this engagement that Marius introduced <lb/>
            the alteration in the spears.. Before this time that part of <lb/>
            the wooden shaft which was let into the iron was fastened <lb/>
            with two iron nails; Marius kept one of the nails as it <lb/>
            was, but he had the other taken out and a wooden peg, <lb/>
            which would be easily broken, put in its place; the <lb/>
            design being that the spear when it had struck the <lb/>
            enemy's shield should not remain straight, for when <lb/>
            the wooden nail broke, the iron head would bend, and <lb/>
            the spear, owing to the twist in the metal part, would still <lb/>
            hold to the shield, and so drag along the ground. Now <lb/>
            Boeorix, the king of the Cimbri, with a very few men <lb/>
            about him, riding up to the camp, challenged Marius to <lb/>
            fix a day and place, and to come out and settle the claim <lb/>
            to the country by a battle. Marius replied, that the <lb/>
            Romans never took advice of their enemies as to fighting; <lb/>
            however, he would gratify the Cimbri in this matter, <lb/>
            and accordingly they agreed on the third day from the <lb/>
            present, and the battle-field was to be the plain of <lb/>
            Vercellæ,† which was suited for the Roman cavalry, and <lb/>
            would give the Cimbri full room for their numbers. <lb/>
            When the appointed day came, the Romans prepared for <lb/>
            battle with the enemy. Catulust had twenty-two thou­ <lb/>
            sand three hundred men, and Marius thirty-two thousand, <lb/>
            which were distributed on each flank of Catulus, who <lb/>
            occupied the centre, as Bulla § has recorded, who was <note type="footnote"> * The object of this contrivance is explained by Plutarch, and it is <lb/>

            he frequently refers to. Catulus wrote a history of the war and of his <lb/>

            Xenophon. It appears from Plutarch's remark that he had not seen <lb/>
            the work of Catulus. </note> <lb/>

            in the battle. Bulla also says, that Marina expected <lb/>
            that the line would be engaged chiefly at the extremities <lb/>
            and on the wings, and with the view of appropriating <lb/>
            the victory to his own soldiers, and that Catulus might <lb/>
            have no part in the contest, and not come to close quarters <lb/>
            with the enemy, he took advantage of the hollow front of <lb/>
            the centre, which usually results when the line is extended, <lb/>
            and accordingly divided and placed his forces as already <lb/>
            stated. Some writers say that Catulus himself also made <lb/>
            a statement to the like effect, in his apology about the <lb/>
            battle, and accused Marius of want of good faith to him. <lb/>
            The infantry of the Cimbri marched slowly from their <lb/>
            fortified posts in a square, each side of which was thirty <lb/>
            stadia: the cavalry, fifteen thousand in number, advanced <lb/>
            in splendid style, wearing helmets which resembled in <lb/>
            form the open mouths of frightful beasts and strange- <lb/>
            shaped heads, surmounted by lofty crests of feathers, <lb/>
            which made them appear taller; they had also breastplates <lb/>
            of iron and white glittering shields. Their practice was to <lb/>
            discharge two darts,* and then closing with the enemy, to <lb/>
            use their large heavy swords.</p>
          <p>XXVI. On this occasion the enemy's cavalry did not <lb/>
            advance straight against the Romans, but deviating to the <lb/>
            right they attempted to draw the Romans little by little in <lb/>
            that direction, with the view of attacking them when they <lb/>
            had got them between themselves and their infantry, <lb/>
            which was on the left. The Roman generals perceived the <lb/>
            manoeuvre, but they could not stop their soldiers, for there <lb/>
            was a cry from some one that the enemy was flying, and <lb/>
            immediately the whole army rushed to the pursuit. In <lb/>
            the meantime the barbarian infantry advanced like a huge <lb/>
            sea in motion. Then Marius, washing his hands and rais­ <lb/>
            ing them to heaven, vowed a hecatomb to the gods; and <lb/>
            Catulus also in like manner raising his hands, vowed to <lb/>
            consecrate t the fortune of that day. It is said that when <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διβολία</foreign> is the reading that I have followed. I have given the <lb/>

            Marius had sacrificed and had inspected the victims, he <lb/>
            cried out with a loud voice, " Mine is the Victory." <lb/>
            When the attack had commenced, an incident happened to <lb/>
            Marius which may be considered as a divine retribution, <lb/>
            as Sulla says. An immense cloud of dust being raised, as <lb/>
            was natural, and having covered the two armies, it <lb/>
            happened that Marius, rushing to the pursuit with his <lb/>
            men after him, missed the enemy, and being carried <lb/>
            beyond their line, was for some time in the plain without <lb/>
            knowing where he was; but it happened that the bar­ <lb/>
            barians closed with Catulus, and the struggle was with <lb/>
            him and his soldiers chiefly, among whom Bulla says that <lb/>
            :he himself fought: he adds, that the heat aided the <lb/>
            Romans, and the sun, which shone full in the face of the <lb/>
            Cimbri. For the barbarians were well inured to cold, <lb/>
            having been brought up in forests, as already observed, <lb/>
            and a cool country, but they were unnerved with the heat, <lb/>
            which made them sweat violently and breathe hard, and <lb/>
            put their shields before their faces, for the battle took <lb/>
            place after the summer solstice, and, according to the <lb/>
            Roman reckoning, three days before the new moon of <lb/>
            the month now called Augustus,* but then Sextilis. The <lb/>
            dust also which covered their enemies helped to encourage <lb/>
            the Romans; for they did not see their number at a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, but running forward they engaged severally man to <lb/>
            man with the enemy, without having been alarmed by the <lb/>
            sight of them. And so well were the bodies of the Romans <lb/>
            inured to toil and exertion, that not one of them was seen <lb/>
            to sweat or pant, though the heat was excessive and they <lb/>
            came to the shock of battle running at full speed, as <lb/>
            Catulus is said to have reported to the honour of his <lb/>
            soldiers.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Now the greater part of the enemy and their <lb/>
            best soldiers were cut to pieces in their ranks, for in order <lb/>
            to prevent the line from being broken the soldiers of the <lb/>
            first rank were fastened together by long chains which <lb/>
            were passed through their belts. The fugitives were <note type="footnote"> * Sextilis, the sixth month of the Roman year when the year began <lb/>

            Quintilis or the fifth month was called Julius in honour of the <lb/>
            Dictator Cæsar, </note><lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            driven back to their encampments, when a most tragic <lb/>
            scene was exhibited. The women standing on the waggons <lb/>
            clothed in black massacred the fugitives, some their <lb/>
            husbands, and others their brothers and fathers, and then <lb/>
            strangling their infants they threw them under the <lb/>
            wheels and the feet of the beasts of burden, and killed <lb/>
            themselves. It is said that one woman hung herself from <lb/>
            the end of the pole of a waggon with her children fastened <lb/>
            to her feet by cords; and that the men, not finding any <lb/>
            trees near, tied themselves to the horns of the oxen and <lb/>
            some to their feet, and then goading the animals to make <lb/>
            them plunge about, were dragged and trampled till they <lb/>
            died. But though so many perished in this manner, <lb/>
            above sixty thousand were taken prisoners, and the <lb/>
            number of those who fell was said to be twice as many. <lb/>
            Now all the valuable property became the booty of the <lb/>
            soldiers of Marius, but the military spoils and standards <lb/>
            and trumpets, it is said, were carried to the tent of <lb/>
            Catulus; and Catulus relied chiefly on this as a proof <lb/>
            that the victory was gained by his men. A dispute <lb/>
            having arisen among the soldiers, as might be expected, <lb/>
            some ambassadors from Parma * who were present were <lb/>
            chosen to act as arbitrators, and the soldiers of Catulus <lb/>
            leading them among the dead bodies of the enemy, pointed <lb/>
            out that the barbarians were pierced by their spears, <lb/>
            which were recognised by the marks on them, for Catulus <lb/>
            had taken care to have his name cut on the shafts. Not­ <lb/>
            withstanding this, the whole credit was given to Marius, <lb/>
            both on account of the previous victory and his superior <lb/>
            rank.t And what was most of all, the people gave him <lb/>
            the title of the third founder ‡ of Rome, considering that <lb/>
            the danger which he had averted was not less than that <lb/>
            of the Gallic invasion, and in their rejoicings with their <lb/>
            wives and children at home they coupled Marius with <lb/>
            the gods in the religious ceremonies that preceded the <note type="footnote">* Reiske would make the ambassadors to be from Panorama <lb/>

            banquet and in their libations, and they thought that he <lb/>
            alone ought to celebrate both triumphs. Marius, however, <lb/>
            did not triumph alone, but Catulus shared the honour, for <lb/>
            Marius wished to show that he was not elated by his <lb/>
            victories: there was another reason also; he was afraid <lb/>
            of the soldiers, who were prepared not to let Marius <lb/>
            triumph, if Catulus were deprived of the honour.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Though Marius was now discharging his <lb/>
            fifth consulship, he was more anxious to obtain a sixth <lb/>
            than others are about the first; and he endeavoured to <lb/>
            gain favour by courting the people and giving way to <lb/>
            the many in order to please them, wherein he went <lb/>
            further than was consistent with the state and dignity <lb/>
            of the office, and further than suited his own temper, <lb/>
            for he wished to show himself very compliant and a <lb/>
            man of the people, when in fact his character was <lb/>
            altogether different. Now it is said that in all civil <lb/>
            matters and amid the noise of the popular assemblies <lb/>
            Marius was entirely devoid of courage, which arose from <lb/>
            his excessive love of applause; and the undaunted spirit <lb/>
            and firmness which he showed in battle failed him before <lb/>
            the people, where he was disconcerted by the most <lb/>
            ordinary expressions of praise or censure. However, the <lb/>
            following story is told of him: Marius had presented with <lb/>
            the citizenship a thousand of the people of Camerinum, <lb/>
            who had particularly distinguished themselves in the <lb/>
            war; this was considered to be an illegal proceeding, and <lb/>
            being charged with it by several persons in public, he <lb/>
            replied that he could not hear the law for the din of arms. <lb/>
            Still it is well known that he was discomposed and <lb/>
            alarmed by the shouts in the popular assemblies. In <lb/>
            military matters, it is true, he received great deference <lb/>
            and had much influence, because his services were <lb/>
            wanted; but in civil business he was cut off from attain­ <lb/>
            ing the first distinction, and accordingly there was nothing <lb/>
            left for him but to gain the affection and favour of the <lb/>
            many; and in order to become the first man at Rome, he <lb/>
            sacrificed all claim to be considered the best. The con­ <lb/>
            sequence was, that he was at variance with all the aris­ <lb/>
            tocratical party, but he feared Metellus most, who had <lb/>
            experienced his ingratitude, and, as a man of sterling <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            worth, was the natural enemy of those who attempted to <lb/>
            insinuate themselves into the popular favour by dishonour­ <lb/>
            able means, and who had no other object than to flatter <lb/>
            the people. Accordingly Marius formed a design to eject <lb/>
            Mctellus from the city; and for this purpose he allied <lb/>
            himself with Glaucia and Saturninus,* who were daring <lb/>
            men, and had at their command a rabble of needy and <lb/>
            noisy fellows, and he made them his tools in introducing <lb/>
            his measures. He also stirred up the soldiers, and by <lb/>
            mixing them with the people in the assemblies he over­ <lb/>
            powered Metellus with his faction. Rutilius, † who is a <lb/>
            lover of truth and an honest man, though he was a <lb/>
            personal enemy of Marius, relates in his history, that by <lb/>
            giving large sums of money to the tribes and buying their <lb/>
            votes Marius kept Metellus out, and that Valerius Flaccus <lb/>
            was rather the servant than the colleague of Marius in his <lb/>
            sixth consulship. However, the people, never conferred <lb/>
            the office of consul so often on any man except Corvinus <lb/>
            Valerius; t though it is said that forty-five years elapsed <lb/>
            between the first and last consulship of Corvinus, while <lb/>
            Marius after his first consulship enjoyed the remaining <lb/>
            five in uninterrupted succession.</p>
          <p>XXIX. It was in his last consulship that Marius got <lb/>
            most odium, from his participating in many of the violent <lb/>
            measures of Saturninus. One of them was the assassi­ <note type="footnote"> * L. Appuleius Saturninus was tribune in the year B.C. 100, in the <lb/>
            sixth consulship of Marius. He was put to death in the same year <lb/>

            , C. Servilius Glaucia was prætor in this year. He lost his life at the <lb/>
            same time with Saturninus. This Servilius was a great favourite with <lb/>
            the people. He proposed and carried a law De Pecuniis Repetundis, <lb/>
            or on mal-adminititration in a public office, some fragments of which <lb/>
            are preserved on a bronze tablet, and have been commented on by <lb/>

            who at that time were taken from the Equites, and retired to Smyrna, <lb/>
            where he spent the rest of his days. He wrote his own Memoirs in <lb/>
            Latin, and a history of Rome in Greek. He was an honest man, <lb/>
            according to all testimony, and innocent of the offence for which he <lb/>

            nation of Nonius,* whom Saturninus murdered because <lb/>
            he was a rival candidate for the tribuneship. Saturninus, <lb/>
            being made a tribune, introduced a measure about the <lb/>
            land, to which t was added a clause that the Senate should <lb/>
            come forward and swear that they would abide by what <lb/>
            ever the people should vote, and would make no opposi. <lb/>
            tion. In the Senate Marius made a show of opposing <lb/>
            this clause in the proposed law, and he said that he <lb/>
            would not take the oath, nor did he think that any man <lb/>
            in his senses would, for if the law was not a bad one, it <lb/>
            was an insult for the Senate to be compelled to make such <lb/>
            concession, instead of giving their consent voluntarily. <lb/>
            What he said, however, was not his real mind, but his <lb/>
            object was to involve Metellus in a difficulty which he <lb/>
            could not evade. For Marius, who considered falsehood <lb/>
            to be a part of virtue and skill, had no intention to observe <lb/>
            what he had promised to the Senate; but as he knew <lb/>
            that Metellus was a man of his word, and considered <lb/>
            truth, as Pindar calls it, the foundation of great virtue, <lb/>
            he wished to entrap Metellus into a refusal before the <lb/>
            Senate, and as he would consequently decline taking the <lb/>
            oath, he designed in this way to make him odious to <lb/>
            the people for ever: and it fell out so. Upon Metellus <lb/>
            declaring that he would never take the oath, the Senate <lb/>
            separated; but a few days after, Saturninus summoned <lb/>
            the Senators to the Rostra, and urged them to take the <lb/>
            oath. When Marius came forward there was profound <lb/>
            silence, and all eyes were turned upon him to see what he <lb/>
            would do. Marius, however, forgetting all his bold expres­ <lb/>
            sions before the Senate, said his neck was not broad <lb/>
            enough for him to be the first to give his opinion on so <lb/>
            weighty a matter all at once, and that he would take the <lb/>
            oath and obey the law, if it was a law; which condition <lb/>
            he cunningly added as a cloak to his shame. The people, <note type="footnote"> * He was murdered at the instigation of Saturninus and Glaucia as <lb/>

            delighted at Marius taking the oath, clapped their hands <lb/>
            and applauded, but the nobility were much dejected and <lb/>
            hated Marius for his tergiversation. However, all the <lb/>
            senators took the oath in order, through fear of the people, <lb/>
            till it came to the turn of Metellus, and though his friends <lb/>
            urged and entreated him to take the oath and so to avoid <lb/>
            the severe penalties which the law of Saturninus enacted <lb/>
            against those who refused, he would not swerve from his <lb/>
            purpose or take the oath, but adhering firmly to his <lb/>
            principles and prepared to submit to any penalty rather <lb/>
            than do a mean thing, he left the Forum, saying to those <lb/>
            about him, that to do a wrong thing was mean, to act <lb/>
            honourably when there was no danger was in any man's <lb/>
            power, but that it was the characteristic of a good man to <lb/>
            do what was right, even when it was accompanied with <lb/>
            risk. Upon th:s Saturninus put it to the vote that the <lb/>
            consuls should proclaim Metellus to be excluded from <lb/>
            fire,. water, and house; and the most worthless part of <lb/>
            the populace was ready to put him to death. Now all the <lb/>
            men of honourable feeling, sympathising with Metellus, <lb/>
            crowded round him, but Metellus would not allow any <lb/>
            commotion to be raised on his account, and he quitted <lb/>
            the city like a wise and prudent man, saying, “ Either <lb/>
            matters will mend and the people will change their minds, <lb/>
            when I shall be invited to return, or if things stay as <lb/>
            they are, it is best to be out of the way." What testimonies <lb/>
            of affection and respect Metellus received in his exile, <lb/>
            and how he spent his time at Rhodes in philosophical <lb/>
            studies, will be better told in his Life.</p>
          <p>XXX. Now Marius did not perceive what incurable <lb/>
            mischief he had done, for in return for the services of <lb/>
            Saturninus t he was obliged to wink at his audacious and <note type="footnote"> Appian's account is clearer than Plutarch's. He says that <lb/>
            Metellus withdrew before the passing of the enactment by which he <lb/>
            was banished. This was the usual formula by which a person was <lb/>
            put under a ban, and it was called the Interdiction of " fire and water,'* <lb/>
            to which sometimes “ house " is added, as in this case. The complete <lb/>
            expression was probably fire, water, and house. Cicero had the same <lb/>
            penalty imposed on him, but he withdrew from Rome, like Metellus, <lb/>
            before the enactment was carried. There is no extant Life of Metellus <lb/>
            Numidicus by Plutarch. </note><note type="footnote"> † The story of the death of Saturninus and Glaucia is told by Appian </note><lb/>

            violent measures, and to remain quiet while Saturninus <lb/>
            was evidently aiming at the supreme power and the <lb/>
            subversion of the constitution by force of arms and blood­ <lb/>
            shed. Between his fear of the disapprobation of the <lb/>
            nobles and his wish to retain the favour of the people, <lb/>
            Marius was reduced to an act of extreme meanness and <lb/>
            duplicity. The first men in the State came to him by <lb/>
            night and urged him to act against Saturninus, whom <lb/>
            Marius, however, received by another door without their <lb/>
            knowledge; and pretending to both parties that he was <lb/>
            troubled with a looseness, he went backwards and forwards <lb/>
            in the house between the nobles and Saturninus, running <lb/>
            first to one and then to the other, and endeavouring to rouse <lb/>
            and irritate them mutually. However, when the Senate <lb/>
            and the Equites began to combine and express their in­ <lb/>
            dignation, he drew out the soldiers into the Forum, and <lb/>
            driving the party of Saturninus to the Capitol, he com­ <lb/>
            pelted them to submit for fear of dying of thirst, by <lb/>
            cutting off the pipes that supplied them with water. <lb/>
            The partisans of Saturninus in despair called out to Marius <lb/>
            and surrendered on the Public Faith, as the Romans term <lb/>
            it. Marius did all he could to save their lives, but <lb/>
            without effect, for as soon as they came down to the <lb/>
            Forum they were massacred. These events made him <lb/>
            odious both to the nobles and the people, and when the <lb/>
            time for electing censors came, contrary to all expectation <lb/>
            he did not offer himself as a candidate, but allowed men <lb/>
            of inferior rank to be elected, fearing he might be rejected. <lb/>
            He, however, alleged as an excuse, though it was not true, <lb/>
            that he did not wish to make himself many enemies by <lb/>
            a rigid scrutiny into their lives and morals. <note type="footnote"> (Civil Wars, i. 32). These men committed another murder before <lb/>
            they were taken off. They set men upon Memmius, who was the <lb/>
            competitor of Glaucia for the consulship, and Memmius was killed with <lb/>
            clubs in the open day while the voting was going on. The Senate <lb/>
            made a decree that Marius should put down these disturbers, but he <lb/>
            acted unwillingly and slowly. The supply of water, according to <lb/>
            Appian, was out off by others, before Marius began to move. These <lb/>
            turbulent times are spoken of by Cicero in his oration for C. Rabirius, <lb/>
            e. 11. Marius put the men who surrendered into the Senate-house, but <lb/>
            the people pulled the tiles off the roof and pelted the prisoners with <lb/>
            the tiles till they died. </note> <pb n="262"/>

          <p>XXXI. A measure being proposed for recalling Me* <lb/>
            tellus from exile, Marius did all he could to stop it toth <lb/>
            by word and deed, but finding his opposition useless, he <lb/>
            at last desisted. The people received the proposed measure <lb/>
            well, and Marius, who could not endure to see the return <lb/>
            of Metellus, set sail for Cappadocia and Galatia, pre­ <lb/>
            tending that he wished to make the sacrifices he had <lb/>
            vowed to the Great Mother, but in reality having quite <lb/>
            a different object in view, which the people never sus­ <lb/>
            pected. Marius was naturally ill suited for times of peace <lb/>
            and for taking a part in civil affairs, as he had attained <lb/>
            his position merely by arms, and now thinking that he <lb/>
            was gradually losing his influence and reputation by doing <lb/>
            nothing and remaining quiet, he looked out for an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of again being actively employed. He hoped to <lb/>
            be able to stir up the kings of Asia and to rouse and stimu­ <lb/>
            late Mithridates,t who was supposed to be ready to go to <lb/>
            war, in which case he expected to be appointed to take <lb/>
            the command against him, and so to fill the city with new <lb/>
            triumphs, and his house with Pontic spoils and the wealth <lb/>
            of the king. Accordingly, though Mithridates paid him <lb/>
            all attention and honour, Marius could not be bent from <lb/>
            his purpose or induced to give way : his only answer was, <lb/>
            “ King, either try to conquer the Romans or obey their <lb/>
            orders in silence ;” an expression which startled the king; <lb/>
            who had often heard the language of the Romans, but <lb/>
            then for the first time heard their bold speech.</p>
          <p>XXXII. On his return to Rome he built a house near the <lb/>
            Forum, either, as he gave out, because he did not wish <lb/>
            those who paid their respects to him to have the trouble <note type="footnote"> * The return of Metellus was mainly due to the exertions of bia <lb/>
            son, who thence obtained the name of Pius. He was restored B C. 99 <lb/>
            by an enactment (lex) which was necessary in order to do away with <lb/>
            the effect of the Interdict. Cicero was restored in like manner. One <lb/>
            Publius Furius, a tribune, the son of a man who had once been a slave, <lb/>
            successfully opposed the return of Met<unclear>llus</unclear> during his year of office. <lb/>
            In the next year Furius was out of office, and Caius Canuleius, a <lb/>
            tribune, prosecuted him for his conduct before the people (populi <lb/>
            judicium), who had not patience enough to listen to his defence; they <lb/>
            tore him in pieces in the Forum. Metellus was detained a whole day <lb/>
            at the gates of Rome with receiving the congratulations of his friendi <lb/>
            on his return. (Appian, Civil Wars, i. 33.) </note><note type="footnote"> t See the Life of Sull<unclear/>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            of coming a great distance, or because he thought the <lb/>
            distance was the reason why a greater number of persons <lb/>
            did not visit his door than that of other persons. The <lb/>
            reason, however, was not this ; but as Marius was inferior <lb/>
            to others in affability of manners and political usefulness, <lb/>
            he was neglected, just like an instrument of war in time <lb/>
            of peace. As for others, he cared less for their superior <lb/>
            popularity, but he was grievously annoyed at Sulla, who <lb/>
            had risen to power through the dislike which the nobles <lb/>
            bore to Marius, and who made his quarrels with Marius the <lb/>
            foundation of his political conduct. But when Bocchus, <lb/>
            the Numidian, on receiving the title of ‛ Ally of the <lb/>
            Romans,' erected in the Capitol Victories bearing trophies, <lb/>
            and by the side of them placed gilded figures representing <lb/>
            Jugartha surrendered by him to Bulla, Marius was trans­ <lb/>
            ported with passion and jealousy at Sulla thus appropriat­ <lb/>
            ing to himself all the credit of this affair, and he was <lb/>
            making ready forcibly to throw down the figures. Sulla <lb/>
            prepared to oppose him, and a civil commotion was just <lb/>
            on the point of breaking out, when it was stopped by the <lb/>
            Social- war, which suddenly burst upon the State. In <lb/>
            this war the most warlike and populous of the Italian <lb/>
            nations combined against Rome, and came very near to <lb/>
            overthrowing her supremacy, for they were not only well <lb/>
            provided with munitions of war and hardy soldiers, <lb/>
            but they had commanders who displayed admirable <note type="footnote"> * The Social called also the Marsic, war, from the warlike nation of <lb/>
            the Marsi who were active in it, commenced B.C. 91 and was not <lb/>
            completely ended till B.O. 88. The immediate cause of the Social war, <lb/>
            or the war of the Italian Allies (Socii) of the Romans, was the <lb/>
            rejection of a measure proposed by the tribune M. Livius Drusus, <lb/>
            which was to give to the Italian allies the rights of Roman citizens. <lb/>
            The Allies were subject States of Rome, which supplied the Romans <lb/>
            with men and money for their wars and contributed to their victories. <lb/>
            They claimed to have the political rights of Romans as a compensation <lb/>
            for their burdens; and they succeeded in the end. The war was at <lb/>
            first unfavourable to the Romans. In the consulship of L. Julius <lb/>
            Cæsar, BO. 90, a Lex Julia was proposed which gave the Roman <lb/>
            citizenship to all the Italians who had continued faithful to Rome, if <lb/>
            they chose to accept it. A Lex Plautia Papiria of the following year <lb/>
            extended the Lex Julia and gave the Roman citizenship to all the <lb/>
            allies except the Samnites and Lucanians. Bulla finished the war <lb/>
            (See Life of Sulla.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            courage and skill, which made them a match for the <lb/>
            Romans.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. This war, which was diversified by many <lb/>
            reverses and a great variety of fortune, took from Marius <lb/>
            as much reputation and influence as it gave to Sulla. For <lb/>
            Marius appeared slow in his plans, and on all occasions <lb/>
            rather over-cautious and tardy; whether it was that age. <lb/>
            had quenched his wonted vigour and fire, for he was now <lb/>
            in his sixty-sixth year, or, as he alleged himself, his nerves <lb/>
            were diseased and his body was incapable of supporting <lb/>
            fatigue, and yet from a feeling of honour he endured the <lb/>
            hardships of the campaign beyond his powers. Not­ <lb/>
            withstanding this he won a great battle, in which he <lb/>
            slaughtered six thousand of the enemy, and he never <lb/>
            allowed them the opportunity of getting any advantage, <lb/>
            but when he was intrenched in his camp he submitted <lb/>
            to be insulted by them and was never irritated by any <lb/>
            challenge to give them battle. It is recorded that Publius <lb/>
            Silo,. who had the highest reputation and influence of <lb/>
            any man on the side of the enemy, addressed him to this <lb/>
            effect: " If you are a great general, Marius, come down <lb/>
            and fight;" to which Marius replied, " Nay, do you, if <lb/>
            you are a great general, compel me to fight against my <lb/>
            will." And again, on another occasion when the enemy <lb/>
            presented a favourable opportunity for attacking them, <lb/>
            but the Romans lacked courage, and both sides retired, he <lb/>
            summoned his soldiers together, and said, “ I don't know <lb/>
            whether to call the enemy or you greater cowards; for <lb/>
            they could not see your back, nor you their nape." At <lb/>
            last, however, he gave up the command, on the ground <lb/>
            that his weakness rendered him unable to endure the <lb/>
            fatigue of the campaign.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. The Italians had now given in, and many <lb/>
            persons at Rome were intriguing for the command in the <lb/>
            Mithridatic war with the assistance of the demagogues; <lb/>
            but, contrary to all expectation, the tribune Sulpicius,t <note type="footnote"> * The MSS. of Plutarch vary in this name. His true name was <lb/>
            Pompædius Silo: he was the leader of the Marsi. He fell in battle <lb/>
            against Metellus Pius. </note><note type="footnote"> † Publius Sulpicius Rufus was tribune B.C. 88 in the first consulship <lb/>
            of Bulla. Cicero had heard many of the speeches of Sulpicius, “ He </note><lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            a most audacious fellow, brought forward Marius and <lb/>
            proposed him as proconsul with power to prosecute the <lb/>
            war against Mithridates. The people indeed were divided, <lb/>
            some being for Marius and others in favour of Sulla; and <lb/>
            they bade Marius go to the warm baths of Baiæ * and <lb/>
            look after his health, inasmuch as he was worn out with <lb/>
            old age and defluxions, as he admitted himself. Marius <lb/>
            had in the neighbourhood of Misenum a sumptuous house, <lb/>
            furnished with luxuries and accommodation too delicately <lb/>
            for a man who had served in so many wars and campaigns. <lb/>
            It is said that Cornelia bought this house for seventy-five <lb/>
            thousand |; and that no long time after it was purchased <lb/>
            by Lucius Lucullus for two millions five hundred thousand; <lb/>
            so quickly did extravagant expenditure spring up and so <lb/>
            great was the increase of luxury. But Marius, moved <lb/>
            thereto by boyish emulation, throwing off his old age and <lb/>
            his infirmities, went daily to the Campus Martius, where <lb/>
            he took his exercises with the young men, and showed <lb/>
            that he was still active in arms and sat firm in all the <lb/>
            movements of horsemanship, though he was not of a <lb/>
            compact form in his old age, but very fat and heavy. <lb/>
            Some were pleased at his being thus occupied, and they <lb/>
            came down to the Campus to see and admire his emulation <lb/>
            and his exercises ; but the wiser part lamented to witness <lb/>
            his greediness after gain and distinction, and they pitied <note type="footnote">was," says Cicero, “of all the orators that ever I heard, the most <lb/>
            dignified, and if one may use the expression, the most tragic: his <lb/>
            voice was powerful, sweet, and clear; his gesture and every movement <lb/>
            graceful; and yet he seemed as if he were trained for the Forum and <lb/>
            not for the stage; his language was rapid and flowery, and yet not <lb/>
            redundant or diffuse." (Brutus, c. 55.) Yet this great orator was no <lb/>
            writer, and Cicero had heard him say that he was not accustomed to <lb/>
            write and could not write. The fact of his inability to write is <lb/>
            sufficiently explained by the fact that he did not try. Cicero has <lb/>
            made Sulpicius one of the speakers in his Book on the Orator, <lb/>
            where (iii. 3) he admits that he was a rash man. (See Penny <lb/>
            Cyclopædia, “ P. Sulpicius Rufus," by the author of this note; and as <lb/>
            to his end, see Bulla, c. 10.) </note><note type="footnote"> * Baiæ on the north side of the Bay of Naples, and near Puteoli <lb/>

            a man who, having risen from poverty to enormous wealth, <lb/>
            and to the highest station from a low degree, knew not <lb/>
            when to put bounds to his good fortune, and was not <lb/>
            satisfied with being an object of admiration and quietly <lb/>
            enjoying what he had, but as if he was in want of every­ <lb/>
            thing, after his triumphs and his honours was setting out <lb/>
            to Cappadocia and the Euxine to oppose himself in his <lb/>
            old age to Archelaus and Neoptolemus, the satraps of <lb/>
            Mithridates. The reasons which Marius alleged against <lb/>
            all this in justification of himself appeared ridiculous; he <lb/>
            said that he wished to serve in the campaign in order to <lb/>
            teach his son military discipline.</p>
          <p>XXXV. The disease that had long been rankling in <lb/>
            the State at last broke out, when Marius had found in the <lb/>
            audacity of Sulpicius * a most suitable instrument to effect <lb/>
            the public ruin; for Sulpicius admired and emulated <lb/>
            Saturninus in everything, except that he charged him <lb/>
            with timidity and want of promptitude in his measures. <lb/>
            But there was no lack of promptitude on the part of <lb/>
            Sulpicius, who kept six hundred of the Equestrian class <lb/>
            about him as a kind of body-guard and called them an <lb/>
            Opposition Senate. He also attacked with a body of armed <lb/>
            men the consuls while they were holding a public meeting; <lb/>
            one of the consuls made his escape from the Forum, but <lb/>
            Sulpicius seized his son and butchered him. Sulla, the <lb/>
            other consul, being pursued, made his escape into the <lb/>
            house of Marius, where nobody would have expected him <note type="footnote"> * The history of this affair is given somewhat more clearly by <lb/>
            Appian (Civil Wars, i. 55). Marius gave the Italians who had lately <lb/>
            obtained the franchise, hopes that they would be distributed among <lb/>
            the other tribes, and thus they would have a preponderance, for they <lb/>
            were more numerous than the old citizens. Sulpicius accordingly <lb/>
            proposed a law to this effect, which was followed by a great disturb­ <lb/>
            ance, upon which the consuls Pompeius and Bulla proclaimed a Jus­ <lb/>
            titium such as was usual on festivals. A Justitium signifies a stopping <lb/>
            of all legal proceedings: during a Justitium nothing could be done; <lb/>
            and the consuls adopted this measure to prevent the proposed luw of <lb/>
            Sulpicius from being carried. Appian says that Sulpicius carried this <lb/>
            law, an.! the tribes in which the new citizens now had the majority <lb/>
            appointed Marius to the command in the war against Mithr dates. <lb/>
            But Bulla and Pompeius afterwards got all the Jaws of Sulpicius <lb/>
            reeled on the ground of being carried by unconstitutional means <lb/>
            (Appian, Civil Wars, L 59). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            to go, and thus avoided his pursuers who ran past; and it <lb/>
            is said that he was let out in safety by Marius by another <lb/>
            door and so got to the camp. But Sulla in his Memoirs <lb/>
            says that he did not fly for refuge to Marius, but with­ <lb/>
            drew there to consult with him about the matters which <lb/>
            Sulpicius was attempting to make him assent to against <lb/>
            his will by surrounding him with bare swords and driving <lb/>
            him on towards the house of Marius, and that finally he <lb/>
            went from the house of Marius to the Rostra, and removed, <lb/>
            as they required him to do, the Justitium. This being <lb/>
            accomplished, Sulpicius, who had now gained a victory, got <lb/>
            the command conferred on Marius by the votes of the <lb/>
            assembly, and Marius, who was prepared to set out, sent <lb/>
            two tribunes to receive the army of Bulla. But Bulla <lb/>
            encouraging his soldiers, who were thirty-five thousand <lb/>
            men well armed, led them to Rome. The soldiers fell on <lb/>
            the tribunes whom Marius had sent, and murdered them. <lb/>
            Marius also put to death many of the friends of Bulla in <lb/>
            Rome, and proclaimed freedom to the slaves * if they would <lb/>
            join him; but it is said that only three slaves accepted the <lb/>
            offer. He made but a feeble resistance to Bulla on his <lb/>
            entering the city, and was soon compelled to fly. On <lb/>
            quitting Rome he was separated from his partisans, owing <lb/>
            to its being dark, and he fled to Solonium,† one of his <lb/>
            farms. He sent his son Marius t to get provisions from <lb/>
            the estates of his father-in-law Mucius, which were not <lb/>
            far off, and himself went to Ostia,§ where Numerius, one of <note type="footnote"> * This act is sufficient to stamp Marius with infamy; and it is not <lb/>

            his friends, had provided a vessel for him, and without <lb/>
            waiting for his son he set sail with his stepson Granius. <lb/>
            The young man arrived at the estates of Mucius, but he <lb/>
            was surprised by the approach of day while he was getting <lb/>
            something together and packing it up, and thus did not <lb/>
            altogether escape the vigilance of his enemies, for some <lb/>
            cavalry came to the spot, suspecting that Marius might <lb/>
            be there. The overseer of the farm, seeing them approach, <lb/>
            hid Marius in a waggon loaded with beans, and yoking <lb/>
            the oxen to it, he met the horsemen on his road to the city <lb/>
            with the waggon. Marius was thus conveyed to the house <lb/>
            of his wife, where he got what he wanted, and by night <lb/>
            made his way to the sea, and embarking in a vessel bound <lb/>
            for Libya, arrived there in safety.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. The elder Marius was carried along the coast <lb/>
            of Italy by a favourable wind, but as he was afraid of one <lb/>
            Geminius, a powerful man in Terracina, and an enemy of <lb/>
            his, he ordered the sailors to keep clear of that place. The <lb/>
            sailors were willing to do as he wished, but the wind veer­ <lb/>
            ing round and blowing from the sea with a great swell, <lb/>
            they were afraid that the vessel could not stand the beat­ <lb/>
            ing of the waves, and as Marius also was much troubled <lb/>
            with sickness, they made for land, and with great diffi­ <lb/>
            culty got to the coast near Circeii.* As the storm in­ <lb/>
            creased and they wanted provisions, they landed from <lb/>
            the vessel and wandered about without any definite <lb/>
            object, but as happens in cases of great difficulty, seeking <lb/>
            merely to escape from the present evil as worst of all, and <lb/>
            putting their hopes on the chances of fortune; for the <lb/>
            land was their enemy, and the sea also, and they feared <lb/>
            to fall in with men, and feared also not to fall in with men, <lb/>
            because they were in want of provisions. After some <lb/>
            time they met with a few herdsmen, who had nothing to <lb/>
            give them in their need, but they recognised Marius and <lb/>
            advised him to get out of the way as quickly as he could, <note type="footnote"> * Circeii is a promontory which contains a solitary elevation, now <lb/>
            Monte Circello. Terracina or Anxur is about twelve miles east of it, <lb/>
            and the Pomptine marshes lie between. This tract is now very thinly <lb/>
            inhabited, being used for pasturage, and it was apparently in the <lb/>
            same state in the time of Marius. Yet this desolate tract where a <lb/>
            house is now rarely seen was once full of Latin towns, in the earlier <lb/>

            for a number of horsemen had just been seen there riding <lb/>
            about in quest of him. Thus surrounded by every diffi­ <lb/>
            culty and his attendants fainting for want of food, he <lb/>
            turned from the road, and plunging into a deep forest, <lb/>
            passed the night in great suffering. The next day, com­ <lb/>
            pelled by hunger and wishing to make use of his remain­ <lb/>
            ing strength before he was completely exhausted, he went <lb/>
            along the shore, encouraging his followers, and entreating <lb/>
            them not to abandon the last hope, for which he reserved <lb/>
            himself on the faith of an old prediction. For when he <lb/>
            was quite a youth and living in the country, he caught in <lb/>
            his garment an eagle's nest as it was falling down, with <lb/>
            seven young ones in it; which his parents wondering at, <lb/>
            consulted the soothsayers, who told them that their son <lb/>
            would become the most illustrious of men, and that it was <lb/>
            the will of fate that he should receive the supreme <lb/>
            command and magistracy seven times. Some affirm that <lb/>
            this really happened to Marius ; but others say that those <lb/>
            who were with Marius at this time and in the rest of his <lb/>
            flight heard the story from him, and believing it, recorded <lb/>
            an event which is altogether fabulous. For an eagle has <lb/>
            not more than two young ones at a time, and they say <lb/>
            that Musaeus * was mistaken when he wrote of the eagle <lb/>
            thus :- <lb/>
            Lays three, two hatches, and one tends with care. <lb/>
            But that Marius frequently during his flight, and when <lb/>
            he was in the extremes! difficulties, said that he should - <lb/>
            survive to enjoy a seventh consulship, is universally <lb/>
            admitted.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. They were now about twenty stadia from <lb/>
            Minturnæ,† an Italian city, when they saw at a distance <note type="footnote"> * This is the older Greek poet of the name. It is unknown when he <lb/>

            a troop of horse riding towards them, and as it chanced <lb/>
            two merchant vessels sailing along the coast. Running <lb/>
            down to the sea as fast as they could and as their strength <lb/>
            would allow, and throwing themselves into the water, <lb/>
            they swam to the vessels. Granius having got into one <lb/>
            of the vessels, passed over to the island of Ænaria,* <lb/>
            which is off that coast. But Marius, who was heavy and <lb/>
            unwieldy, was with difficulty held above the water by <lb/>
            two slaves and placed in the other vessel, the horsemen <lb/>
            being now close to them and calling from the shore to the <lb/>
            sailors either to bring the vessel to land or to throw <lb/>
            Marius overboard, and to set sail wherever they pleased. <lb/>
            But as Marius entreated them with tears in his eyes, <lb/>
            those who had the command of the vessel, after changing <lb/>
            their minds as to what they should do as often as was <lb/>
            possible in so short a time, at last told the horsemen that <lb/>
            they would not surrender Marius. The horsemen rode <lb/>
            off in anger, and the sailors again changing their minds, <lb/>
            came to land, and casting anchor at the mouth of the <lb/>
            Liris, which spreads out like a lake, they advised Marius <lb/>
            to disembark and take some food on land and to rest <lb/>
            himself from his fatigues till a wind should rise: they <lb/>
            added, that it was the usual time for the sea-breeze to <lb/>
            decline, and for a fresh breeze to spring up from the <lb/>
            marshes. Marius did as they advised, and the sailors <lb/>
            carried him out of the vessel and laid him on the grass, <lb/>
            little expecting what was to follow. The sailors imme­ <lb/>
            diately embarking again and raising the anchor, sailed off <lb/>
            as fast as they could, not thinking it honourable to surrender <lb/>
            Marius or safe to protect him. In this situation, deserted <lb/>
            by everybody, he lay for some time silent on the shore, <lb/>
            and at last recovering himself with difficulty, he walked <lb/>
            on with much pain on account of there being no path. <lb/>
            After passing through deep swamps and ditches full of <lb/>
            water and mud, he came to the hut of an old man who <lb/>
            worked in the marshes, and falling down at his feet, he <lb/>
            entreated him to save and help a man, who, if he escaped <lb/>
            from the present dangers, would reward him beyond all <lb/>
            his hopes. The man, who either knew Marius of old or <note type="footnote"> * Einana, now Ischia, it forty miles south of the mouth of the <lb/>
            Liris. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            saw something in the expression of his countenance which <lb/>
            indicated superior rank, said that his hut was sufficient <lb/>
            to shelter him if that was all he wanted, but if he was <lb/>
            wandering about to avoid his enemies, he could conceal <lb/>
            him in a place which was more retired. Upon Marius <lb/>
            entreating him to do so, the old man took him to the <lb/>
            marsh, and bidding him lie down in a hole near the river <lb/>
            he covered Marius with reeds and other light things of <lb/>
            the kind, which were well adapted to hide him without <lb/>
            pressing too heavily.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. After a short time a sound and noise from <lb/>
            the hut reached the ears of Marius. Geminius of Terracina <lb/>
            had sent a number of men in pursuit of him, some of whom <lb/>
            had chanced to come there, and were terrifying the old <lb/>
            man and rating him for having harboured and concealed <lb/>
            an enemy of the Romans. Marius, rising from his hiding- <lb/>
            place and stripping off his clothes, threw himself into the <lb/>
            thick and muddy water of the marsh; and this was the <lb/>
            cause of his not escaping the search of his pursuers, who <lb/>
            dragged him out covered with mud, and leading him <lb/>
            naked to Minturnæ, gave him up to the magistrates. <lb/>
            Now instructions- had been already sent to every city, <lb/>
            requiring the authorities to search for Marius, and to put <lb/>
            him to death when he was taken. However, the magis­ <lb/>
            trates thought it best to deliberate on the matter first, <lb/>
            and in the meantime they lodged Marius in the house of <lb/>
            a woman named Fannia,t who was supposed not to be. <note type="footnote"> * Marina and his adherents had been declared enemies to the State; <lb/>
            and in the declaration it was not forgotten that Marius had attempted <lb/>
            to excite the slaves to rebellion. The head of Sulpicius was already <lb/>
            stuck up in the Forum (Appian, Civil Wars, i. 60; Velleius, ii. 19). </note><note type="footnote"> † A divorce at Rome was effected by the husband or wife giving <lb/>
            a written notice. In the time of Cicero, at least, either party might <lb/>
            effect the divorce. If the divorce was owing to the adultery of the <lb/>
            wife, the husband was entitled to retain a part of the marriage-portion; <lb/>
            a sixth, according to Ulpian (Frag. vi.). The marriage-portion or Dos <lb/>
            (which Plutarch translates by the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φέρνη</foreign>) was tl at <lb/>
            property which on the occasion of a woman's marriage was transferred <lb/>
            to the husband by the woman or by another, for the purpose of <lb/>
            enabling the husband to bear the additional burden of a wife and <lb/>
            family. All the woman's property which did not become dos, re­ <lb/>
            mained her own, except in one of the forms of marriage (conventio in <lb/>
            manum), when, pursuant to the nature of the union by which the wife <lb/>
            came into her husband's power and assumed towards him the relation </note><lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            kindly disposed towards him on account of an old grudge. <lb/>
            Fannia had a husband whose name was Tinnius, and on <lb/>
            separating from him she claimed her portion, which was <lb/>
            considerable. The husband charged her with adultery, <lb/>
            and Marius, who was then in his sixth consulship, presided <lb/>
            as judge. But on the trial it appeared that Fannia had <lb/>
            been a loose woman, and that her husband, though he <lb/>
            knew it, took her to wife, and lived with her a long time; <lb/>
            accordingly, Marius being disgusted with both of them, <lb/>
            decreed that the man should return the woman's portion, <lb/>
            but he imposed on the woman, as a mark of infamy, a <lb/>
            penalty of four copper coins.* Fannia, however, did not <lb/>
            on this occasion exhibit the feeling of a woman who had <lb/>
            been wronged, but when she saw Marius, far from show­ <lb/>
            ing any resentment for the past, she did all that she could <lb/>
            for him under the circumstances, and encouraged him. <lb/>
            Marius thanked her, and said that he had good hopes, for <lb/>
            a favourable omen had occurred to him, which was some­ <lb/>
            thing of this sort:- When they were leading him along, <lb/>
            and he was near the house of Fannia, the doors being <lb/>
            opened, an ass ran out to drink from a spring which was <lb/>
            flowing hard by: the ass, looking at Marius in the face <lb/>
            with a bold and cheerful air, at first stood opposite him, <note type="footnote">of a daughter, all her property became her husband's; as is distinctly <lb/>
            asserted by Cicero (Topica, 4; compare Ulpian, Frag. xix. 18). As <lb/>
            the dos was given to the husband for a particular purpose, it was con­ <lb/>
            sistent that it should be returned when the marriage was dissolved. <lb/>
            The means of recovering the dos was by action. The liability to <lb/>
            restore the dos would be one check on the husband lightly separating <lb/>
            from his wife. When Cicero's brother Quintus divorced his wife <lb/>
            Pomponia, he had a good deal of trouble in finding means to return <lb/>
            her portion. (Cicero, Ad Attic. xiv. 13). The law of dos comprised a <lb/>
            great number of rules, and is a difficult subject. Rein (Das Römische <lb/>
            Privatrecht, p. 204) has given a sketch of the Roman Law of Divo ce <lb/>
            that is useful to scholars ; and he has in another place (p. 193, &amp;c.) <lb/>
            treated of the Law of Dos. It is difficult to avoid error in stating any­ <lb/>
            thing briefly on the subject of Divorce and Dos. </note><note type="footnote"> * Plutarch does not say what the copper coins were; nor is it impor­ <lb/>
            tant. The penalty was merely nominal, but it was accompanied by <lb/>
            what the Romans called Infamia. Fannia showed on this occasion <lb/>
            that she was a better woman than Marius took her to be. Tinnius is <lb/>
            perhaps not a Roman name. There are many errors in proper names <lb/>
            in Plutarch's text. Perhaps the true reading is Titinius. (See the <lb/>
            note of Sintenis). </note> <lb/>

            and then making a loud braying, sprang past him frisk­ <lb/>
            ing with joy. From this, Marius drew a conclusion, as <lb/>
            he said that the deity indicated that his safety would <lb/>
            come through the sea rather than through the land, for <lb/>
            the ass did not betake himself to dry food, but turned <lb/>
            from him to the water. Having said this to Fannia, he <lb/>
            went to rest alone, bidding her close the door of the <lb/>
            apartment.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. The magistrates - and council of Minturnæ, <lb/>
            after deliberating, resolved that there ought to be no <lb/>
            delay, and that they should put Marius to death. As <lb/>
            none of the citizens would undertake to do it, a Gallic or <lb/>
            Cimbrian horse-soldier, for the story is told both ways, <lb/>
            took a sword and entered the apartment. Now that part <lb/>
            of the room in which Marius happened to be lying was <lb/>
            not very well lighted, but was in shade, and it is said that <lb/>
            the eyes of Marius appeared to the soldier to dart a strong <lb/>
            flame, and a loud voice issued from the gloom, " Man, do <lb/>
            you dare to kill Caius Marius ?" The barbarian immediately <lb/>
            took to flight, and throwing the sword down, rushed <lb/>
            through the door, calling out, “I cannot kill Caius Marius." <lb/>
            This caused a general consternation, which was succeeded <lb/>
            by compassion and change of opinion, and self-reproach <lb/>
            for having come to so illegal and ungrateful a resolution <lb/>
            concerning a man who had saved Italy, and whom it <lb/>
            would be a disgrace not to assist. " Let him go, then," it <lb/>
            was said, " where he pleases, as an exile, and suffer in <lb/>
            some other place whatever fate has reserved for him. <lb/>
            And let us pray that the gods visit us not with their <lb/>
            anger for ejecting Marius from our city in poverty and <lb/>
            rags." Moved by such considerations, all in a body <lb/>
            entered the room where Marius was, and getting round <lb/>
            him, began to conduct him to the sea. Though every <lb/>
            man was eager to furnish something or other, and all were <lb/>
            busying themselves, there was a loss of time. The grove <lb/>
            of Marica, as it is called, obstructed the passage to the sea, <lb/>
            for it was an object of great veneration, and it was a strict <lb/>
            rule to carry nothing out of it that had ever been carried <note type="footnote"> * All or nearly all of the Italian cities had a municipal constitution <lb/>
            The chief magistrates were generally two, and called Duumviri. The <lb/>
            Council was called the Decuriones or Senate. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>

            in; and now, if they went all round it, there would of <lb/>
            necessity be delay: but this difficulty was settled by one <lb/>
            of the older men at last calling out, that no road was <lb/>
            inaccessible or impassable by which Marius was saved; <lb/>
            and he was the first to take some of the things that they <lb/>
            were conveying to the ship and to pass through the <lb/>
            place.</p>
          <p>XL. Everything was soon got ready through these <lb/>
            zealous exertions, and a ship was supplied for Marius by <lb/>
            one Belæus, who afterwards caused a painting to be made <lb/>
            representing these events, and dedicated it in the temple. <lb/>
            Marius embarking, was carried along by the wind, and by <lb/>
            chance was taken to the island Ænaria, where he found <lb/>
            Granius and the rest of his friends, and set sail with them <lb/>
            for Libya. As their water failed, they were compelled to <lb/>
            touch at Erycina in Sicily. Now the Roman quæstor, <lb/>
            who happened to be about these parts on the look-out, <lb/>
            was very nearly taking Marius when he landed; and he <lb/>
            killed about sixteen of the men who were sent to get <lb/>
            water. Marius, hastily embarking and crossing the sea <lb/>
            to the island of Meninx,* there learnt for the first time <lb/>
            that his son had escaped with Cethegus, and that they <lb/>
            were going to Iampsas (Hiempsal), king of the Numidians, <lb/>
            to ask aid of him. This news encouraged him a little, <lb/>
            and he was emboldened to move from the island to the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of Carthage. At this time the governor <lb/>
            of Libya was Sextilius, a Roman, who had neither received <lb/>
            injury nor favour from Marius, and it was expected that <lb/>
            he would help him, at least as far as feelings of com­ <lb/>
            passion move a man. But no sooner had Marius landed <lb/>
            with a few of his party, than an officer met him, and <lb/>
            standing right in front of him said, " The Governor <lb/>
            Sextilius forbids. you, Marius, to set foot on Libya, and he <lb/>
            says that if you do, he will support the decree of the Senate <note type="footnote"> * This is the island of Gerba in the regency of Tunis, close to the <lb/>
            shore and to the town of Gabs or Cabes. It is now a large and <lb/>
            populous island inhabited by an industrious manufacturing population. <lb/>
            It is about 200 miles south of Tunis, which is near the site of Carthage. <lb/>
            Cercina is a group of smaller islands above 50 miles north of Meninx, <lb/>
            now called the Karkenna islands. These distances shew that Marius <lb/>
            must have been rambling about for some time an this coast (Penny <lb/>
            Cyclopædia, art “Tunis.”) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            by treating you as an enemy." On hearing this, grief <lb/>
            and indignation deprived Marius of utterance, and he was <lb/>
            a long time silent, looking fixedly at the officer. Upon <lb/>
            the officer asking Marius what he had to say, what reply <lb/>
            he had for the governor, he answered with a deep groan, <lb/>
            “Tell him you have seen Caius Marius a fugitive sitting <lb/>
            on the ruins of Carthage ": a reply in which he not un­ <lb/>
            aptly compared the fate of that city and his own changed <lb/>
            fortunes. In the meantime, Tampsas, the king of the <lb/>
            Numidians, being unresolved which way to act, treated <lb/>
            young Marius and his companions with respect, but still <lb/>
            detained them on some new pretext whenever they wished <lb/>
            to leave; and it was evident that he had no fair object <lb/>
            in view in thus deferring their departure. However, an <lb/>
            incident happened of no uncommon kind, which brought <lb/>
            about their deliverance. The younger Marius was hand­ <lb/>
            some, and one of the king's concubines was grieved to see <lb/>
            him in a condition unbefitting his station; and this <lb/>
            feeling of compassion was a beginning and motive towards <lb/>
            love. At first, however, Marius rejected the woman's pro­ <lb/>
            posals, but seeing that there were no other means of <lb/>
            escape, and that her conduct proceeded from more serious <lb/>
            motives than mere passion, he accepted her proffered <lb/>
            favours, and with her aid stole away with his friends and <lb/>
            made his escape to his father. After embracing one an­ <lb/>
            other, they went along the shore, where they saw some <lb/>
            scorpions fighting, which Marius considered to be a bad <lb/>
            omen. Accordingly they forthwith embarked in a fishing <lb/>
            boat, and passed over to the island Cercina, which was <lb/>
            no great distance from the mainland; and it happened <lb/>
            that they had only just set sail, when some horsemen <lb/>
            despatched by the king were seen riding to the spot where <lb/>
            they embarked. Marius thus escaped a danger equal to <lb/>
            any that ever threatened him.</p>
          <p>XLI. News reached Rome that Bulla was encoun­ <lb/>
            tering the generals of Mithridates in Boeotia, while the <lb/>
            consuls were quarrelling and taking up arms. A battle <lb/>
            was fought, in which Octavius * got the victory and ejected <note type="footnote"> * On. Octavius Nepos and L. Cornelius Oinna were consuls B.O. 87. <lb/>
            Cinna had sworn to maintain the interests of the Senate (Sulla, c. 10), <lb/>
            but when Bulla had left Italy for the Mithridatic war, Cinna declared </note> <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            Cinna, who was attempting to govern by violent means, <lb/>
            and he put in Cinna's place as consul Cornelius Merula ; <lb/>
            but Cinna collected troops in Italy and made war against <lb/>
            Octavius. On hearing this, Marius determined to set sail <lb/>
            immediately, which he did with some Moorish cavalry that <lb/>
            he took from Africa, and some few Italians who had fled <lb/>
            there, but the number of both together did not exceed a <lb/>
            thousand. Coming to shore at Telamo* in Tyrrhenia, and <lb/>
            landing there, Marius proclaimed freedom to the slaves; <lb/>
            and as the freemen who were employed in agriculture <lb/>
            there, and in pasturing cattle, flocked to the sea, attracted <lb/>
            by his fame, Marius persuaded the most vigorous of them <lb/>
            to join him, and in a few days he had collected a con­ <lb/>
            siderable force and manned forty ships. Knowing that <lb/>
            Octavius was an honourable man and wished to direct the <lb/>
            administration in the justest way, but that Cinna was <lb/>
            disliked by Sulla and opposed to the existing constitution, <lb/>
            he determined to join him with his force. Accordingly <lb/>
            he sent to Ciuna and proffered to obey him as consul in <lb/>
            everything. Cinna accepted the proposal, and naming <lb/>
            Marius proconsul, sent him fasces and the other insigna <lb/>
            of the office. Marius, however, observing that such things <lb/>
            were not suited to his fortunes, clad in a mean dress, with <lb/>
            his hair uncut from the day that he had been an exile, <lb/>
            and now above seventy years of age, advanced with slow <lb/>
            steps, wishing to make himself an object of compassion; <lb/>
            but there was mingled with his abject mien more than <lb/>
            his usual terrific expression of countenance, and through <note type="footnote"> himself in favour of the new citizens, and attempted to carry the <lb/>
            measure for incorporating them with the old tribes. It is said that he <lb/>
            received a considerable sum of money for undertaking this. The <lb/>
            parties of Cinna and Octavius armed for the contest which was ex­ <lb/>
            pected to take place when this measure was proposed. Octavius drove <lb/>
            his opponents out of the Forum with great slaughter, and Cinna left <lb/>
            the city. He was joined by great numbers of the new citizens and <lb/>
            then formed an army. The Senate passed a decree that Cinna was <lb/>
            neither consul nor a citizen, inasmuch as he had deserted the city, <lb/>
            and offered freedom to the slaves if they would join him. L. Cornelius <lb/>
            Merula, who was elected consul in place of Cinna, was flamen dialis, <lb/>
            or Priest of Jupiter. He put himself to death by opening his vein.. <lb/>
            after Marius and Cinna entered Rome. (Appian, Civil Wars, i. 74). </note><note type="footnote"> * Now Talamone, on the coast of Tuscany near Orbitello. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            his downcast looks he showed that his passion, so far <lb/>
            from being humbled, was infuriated by his reverses of <lb/>
            fortune.</p>
          <p>XLIL As soon as he had embraced Cinna and greeted <lb/>
            the soldiers, Marius commenced active operations and gave <lb/>
            a great turn to affairs. First of all, by attacking the corn­ <lb/>
            vessels * with his ships and plundering the merchants, he <lb/>
            made himself master of the supplies. He next sailed to <lb/>
            the maritime cities, which he took; and, finally, Ostia <lb/>
            being treacherously surrendered to him, he made plunder <lb/>
            of the property that he found there and put to death many <lb/>
            of the people, and by blocking up the river he completely <lb/>
            cut off his enemies from all supplies by sea. He now <lb/>
            moved on with his army towards Rome and occupied the <lb/>
            Janiculus. Octavius damaged his own cause, not so much <lb/>
            from want of skill as through his scrupulous observance <lb/>
            of the law, to which he unwisely sacrificed the public <lb/>
            interests; for though many persons advised him to invite <lb/>
            the slaves to join him by promising their freedom, he <lb/>
            refused to make them members of the State from which <lb/>
            he was endeavouring to exclude Marius in obedience to <lb/>
            the law. On the arrival at Rome of Metellus,† the son of <lb/>
            Metellus who had commanded in Libya, and had been <lb/>
            banished from the city through the intrigues of Marius, <lb/>
            the soldiers deserted Octavius and came to Metellus, <lb/>
            entreating him to take the command and save the city; <lb/>
            they said, if they had an experienced and active com­ <lb/>
            mander, they would fight well and get the victory. But <lb/>
            Metellus expressed great dissatisfaction at their conduct, <lb/>
            and bade them go to the consul, upon which they passed <lb/>
            over to the enemy. Metellus also in despair left the city. <note type="footnote"> *Rome had long before this derived supplies of corn from Sicily <lb/>
            and other parts out of Italy. Perhaps this may prove that the culti­ <lb/>
            vation in the Campagna of Rome and the countries south of Terracing <lb/>
            had not improved with the increase of Rome. But other countries are <lb/>
            better suited for grain than the low lands of this side of Italy, and so <lb/>
            far as concerns the cost of transport, grain might be brought from <lb/>
            Sardinia and Sicily as cheaply as from many parts of Italy, and cheaper <lb/>
            than from the plains of Apulia, which is a good corn country. </note><note type="footnote"> t Metellus Pius was now carrying on the war against the Samni te <lb/>
            who were still in arms. He came to Rome at the invitation of the <lb/>
            Senate. (Appian, Civil Wars, i. 68.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            But Octavius was persuaded by Chaldæans * and certain <lb/>
            diviners and interpreters of the Sibylline books to stay <lb/>
            in Rome by the assurance that all would turn out well. <lb/>
            Octavius, who in all other matters had as solid a judgment <lb/>
            as any Roman, and most carefully maintained the consular <lb/>
            dignity free from all undue influence according to the <lb/>
            usage of his country and the laws, as if they were <lb/>
            unchangeable rules, nevertheless showed great weakness <lb/>
            in keeping company with impostors and diviners, rather <lb/>
            than with men versed in political and military matters. <lb/>
            Now Octavius was dragged down from the Rostra before <lb/>
            Marius entered the city, by some persons who where sent <lb/>
            forward, and murdered; and it is said that a Chaldæan <lb/>
            writing was found in his bosom after he was killed. It <lb/>
            seemed to be a very inexplicable circumstance, that of two <lb/>
            illustrious commanders, Marius owed his success to not <lb/>
            disregarding divination, and Octavius thereby lost his life.</p>
          <p>XLIII. Matters being in this state, the Senate met and <lb/>
            sent a deputation to Cinna and Marius to invite them into <lb/>
            the city and to entreat them to spare the citizens. Cinna, <lb/>
            as consul, sitting on his chair of office, gave audience to <lb/>
            the commissioners and returned a kind answer: Marius <lb/>
            stood by the consul's chair without speaking a word, but <lb/>
            indicating by the unchanging heaviness of his brow and <lb/>
            his gloomy look that he intended to fill Rome with <lb/>
            slaughter. After the audience was over, they marched to <lb/>
            the city. Cinna entered accompanied by his guards, but <lb/>
            Marius halting at the gates angrily affected to have some <lb/>
            scruples about entering. He said he was an exile and <lb/>
            was excluded from his country by a law, and if anybody <note type="footnote"> * The Roman writers often mention the Chaldæans. They were <lb/>
            adventurers from Asia who made their living in the great superstition <lb/>
            market of Rome by foretelling future events. Whether they wero <lb/>
            really Chaldæans does not appear. The death of Octavius is told <lb/>
            somewhat differently by Appian (Civil Wars, i. 71). His head was cut <lb/>
            off and placed on the Röstra, and many other heads also. He was the <lb/>
            first consul whose head was exposed on the Rostra. Other atrocities <lb/>
            are mentioned by Appian, c. 72, &amp;c. It was the fashion in England <lb/>
            less than a hundred years back to place traitors' heads on Temple Bar, <lb/>
            London. “I have been this morning at the Tower, and passed under <lb/>
            the new heads at Temple Bar; where people make a trade of letting <lb/>
            spy-gla ses at a halfpenny a look" (Horace Walpolo, Letter to George <lb/>
            Montague, Aug. 16, 17i6). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            wanted to have him in the city, they must go to the vote <lb/>
            again and undo the vote by which he was banished, just <lb/>
            as if he were a man who respected the laws and were <lb/>
            returning from exile to a free state. Accordingly he <lb/>
            summoned the people to the Forum, but before three or <lb/>
            four of the tribes had voted, throwing off the mask and <lb/>
            setting aside all the talk about being legally recalled, he <lb/>
            entered with some guards selected from the slaves who <lb/>
            had flocked to him, and who were called Bardiæi. These <lb/>
            fellows killed many persons by his express orders and <lb/>
            many on the mere signal of his nod ; and at last meeting <lb/>
            with Ancharius, a senator who had filled the office of <lb/>
            prætor, they struck him down with their daggers in the <lb/>
            presence of Marius, when they saw that Marius did not <lb/>
            salute him. After this whenever he did not salute a <lb/>
            man or return his salute, this was a signal for them <lb/>
            to massacre him forthwith in the streets, in consequence <lb/>
            of which even the friends of Marius were filled with <lb/>
            consternation and horror when they approached him. <lb/>
            The slaughter was now great, and Cinna's appetite was <lb/>
            dulled and he was satisfied with blood; but Marius daily <lb/>
            went on with his passion at the highest pitch and thirst­ <lb/>
            ing for vengeance, through the whole list of those whom <lb/>
            suspected in any degree. And every road and every <lb/>
            city was filled with the pursuers, hunting out those who <lb/>
            attempted to escape and conceal themselves, and the ties of <lb/>
            hospitality and friendship were proved to be no security <lb/>
            in misfortune, for they were very few who did not betray <lb/>
            those who sought refuge with them. This rendered the <lb/>
            conduct of the slaves of Cornutus the more worthy of <lb/>
            praise and admiration, for they concealed their master at <lb/>
            home, and hanging up by the neck the dead body of some <lb/>
            obscure person, and putting a gold ring on his finger, they <lb/>
            showed him to the guards of Marius, and then wrapping <lb/>
            up the body as if it were their master's, they interred it. <lb/>
            The device went unsuspected, and Cornutus being thus <lb/>
            secreted by his slaves, made his escape to Gaul.</p>

            friend, but still he did not escape. This man, though <lb/>
            poor, and of the lower class, received in his house one of <lb/>
            the most illustrious of the Romans, and wishing to enter­ <lb/>
            tain him as well as he could, he sent a slave to one of the <lb/>
            neighbouring wine-shops to get some wine. As the slave <lb/>
            was more curious than usual in tasting it, and told the <lb/>
            man to give him some better wine, the merchant asked <lb/>
            what could be the reason that he did not buy the new <lb/>
            wine, as usual, and the ordinary wine, but wanted some <lb/>
            of good quality and high price. The slave replied in his <lb/>
            simplicity, as he was speaking to an old acquaintance, <lb/>
            that his master was entertaining Marcus Antonius, who <lb/>
            was concealed at his house. The wine-dealer, a faithless <lb/>
            and unprincipled wretch, as soon as the slave left him, <lb/>
            hurried off to Marius, who was at supper, and having <lb/>
            gained admission, told him that he would betray Marcus <lb/>
            Antonius to him. On hearing this, Marius is said to have <lb/>
            uttered a loud shout and to have clapped his hands with <lb/>
            delight; and he was near getting up and going to the <lb/>
            place himself, but his friends stopped him, and he de­ <lb/>
            spatched Annius with some soldiers, with orders to bring <lb/>
            him the head of Antonius immediately. On reaching the <lb/>
            house, Annius waited at the door, and the soldiers mount­ <lb/>
            ing the stairs entered the room, but on seeing Antonius, <lb/>
            every man began to urge some of his companions and push <lb/>
            him forward to do the deed instead of himself. And so <lb/>
            powerful were the charm and persuasion of his eloquence, <lb/>
            when Antonius began to speak and pray for his life, that <lb/>
            not a man of them could venture to lay hands on him or <lb/>
            look him in the face, but they all bent their heads down <lb/>
            and shed tears. As this caused some delay, Annius went <lb/>
            upstairs, where he saw Antonius speaking and the soldiers <lb/>
            deplored his fate (De Oratore, iii. 3), had the same ill-luck from the <lb/>
            hands of Antonius the Triumvir. M. Antonius the orator filled many <lb/>
            high posts, and was consul B.C. 99. But his title to remembrance is <lb/>
            his great oratorical skill. Cicero says that Antonius and his con­ <lb/>
            temporary Lucius Licinius Crassus were the first Romans who equalled <lb/>
            the great orators of Greece. The judicious remarks of Antonius on <lb/>
            the conduct of a cause are preserved by Cicero (De Oratore, ii. 72 ). <lb/>
            Antonius left no writings. (See “ Antonius, Marcus," in Biog. Diet. <lb/>
            of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.) <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            awed and completely softened by his eloquence; on which <lb/>
            he abused them, and running up to Antonius, cut off his <lb/>
            head with his own hand. The friends of Catulus Lutatius, <lb/>
            who had been joint consul with Marius and with him had <lb/>
            triumphed over the Cimbri, interceded for him with Marius, <lb/>
            and begged for his life; but the only answer they got <lb/>
            was, " He must die<unclear/> " and accordingly Catulus shut him­ <lb/>
            self up in a room, and lighting a quantity of charcoal, <lb/>
            suffocated himself. Headless trunks thrown into the <lb/>
            streets and trampled underfoot excited no feeling of com­ <lb/>
            passion, but only a universal shudder and alarm. But <lb/>
            the people were most provoked by the licence of the Bar­ <lb/>
            diæi, who murdered fathers of families in their houses, <lb/>
            defiled their children, and violated their wives; and they <lb/>
            went on plundering and committing violence, till Cinna <lb/>
            and Sertorius combining, attacked them when they were <lb/>
            asleep in the camp, and transfixed them with spears.</p>
          <p>XLV. In the meantime, as if the wind was beginning <lb/>
            to turn, reports reached Rome from all quarters that Sulla <lb/>
            had finished the war with Mithridates, and recovered <lb/>
            the provinces, and was sailing against the city with a <lb/>
            large force. This intelligence caused a brief cessation <lb/>
            and pause to unspeakable calamities, for Marius and his <lb/>
            faction were in expectation of the immediate arrival of <lb/>
            their enemies. Now being elected consul- for the seventh <lb/>
            time, on the very Calends of January, which is the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of the year, Marius caused one Sextus Lucinus f to be <lb/>
            thrown down the Tarpeian rock, which appeared to be a <lb/>
            presage of the great misfortunes that were again to befal <lb/>
            the partisans of Marius and the State. But Marius was <lb/>
            now worn out with labour, and, as it were, drowned with <lb/>
            cares, and cowed in his spirit; and the experience of past <lb/>
            dangers and toil made him tremble at the thoughts of a <lb/>
            new war, and fresh struggles and alarms, and he could <lb/>
            not sustain himself when he reflected that now he would <note type="footnote"> * Marius was elected Consul for the seventh time B.C. 86. His <lb/>

            have to hazard a contest, not with Octavius or Merula at <lb/>
            the head of a tumultuous crowd and seditious rabble, but <lb/>
            that Sulla was advancing—Sulla, who had once driven <lb/>
            him from Rome, and had now confined Mithridates within <lb/>
            the limits of his kingdom of Pontus. With his mind <lb/>
            crushed by such reflections, and placing before his eyes <lb/>
            his long wanderings and escapes and dangers in his flight <lb/>
            by sea and by land, he fell into a state of deep despair, <lb/>
            and was troubled with nightly alarms and terrific dreams <lb/>
            in which he thought he heard a voice continually calling <lb/>
            out, <lb/>
            "Dreadful is the lion's lair <lb/>
            Though he is no longer there.- <lb/>
            As he greatly dreaded wakeful nights, he gave himself <lb/>
            up to drinking and intoxication at unseasonable hours and <lb/>
            to a degree unsuited to his age, in order to procure sleep, <lb/>
            as if he could thus elude his cares. At last when a man <lb/>
            arrived with news from the sea, fresh terrors seized him, <lb/>
            partly from fear of the future and partly from feeling the <lb/>
            burden and the weariness of the present state of affairs; <lb/>
            and while he was in this condition, a slight disturbance <lb/>
            sufficed to bring on a kind of pleurisy, as the philosopher <lb/>
            Poseidonius * relates, who also says that he had an inter­ <lb/>
            view and talked with him on the subject of his embassy, <lb/>
            while Marius was sick. But one Caius Piso,t an historian, <lb/>
            says that Marius, while walking about with some friends <lb/>
            after supper, fell to talking of the incidents of his life, begin­ <lb/>
            ning with his boyhood, and after enumerating his many <lb/>
            vicissitudes of fortine, he said that no man of sense ought <lb/>
            to trust fortune after such reverses; upon which he took <lb/>
            leave of his friends, and keeping his bed for seven successive <lb/>
            days, thus died. Some say that his ambitious character <note type="footnote"> * The same person who is mentioned above (c. 1). He was of <lb/>

            survived Cicero's consulship, as we see from a letter of Cicero (Ad <lb/>
            Attic, ii. 1), which also shows that he knew how to flatter his old <lb/>
            pupil's vanity. Cicero (De Natura Deorum, ii. 38) speaks of a Sphere <lb/>
            of Poseidonius which represented certain phenomena of the sun's and <lb/>
            moon's motions and those of the five stars (planets). Nothing is <lb/>
            known about this embassy. </note><note type="footnote"> t It is not known who is meant. (See Krause, Fragment. Historicorum <lb/>

            was most completely disclosed during his illness by his <lb/>
            falling into the extravagant delusion that he was conduct­ <lb/>
            ing the war against Mithridates, and he would then put <lb/>
            his body into all kinds of attitudes and movements, as he <lb/>
            used to do in battle, and accompany them with loud shouts <lb/>
            and frequent cheers. So strong and unconquerable a <lb/>
            desire to be engaged in that war had his ambitious and <lb/>
            jealous character instilled into him; and therefore, though <lb/>
            he had lived to be seventy years of age, and was the first <lb/>
            Roman who had been seven times consul and had made <lb/>
            himself a family, and wealth enough for several kings, he <lb/>
            still bewailed his fortune, and complained of dying before <lb/>
            he had attained the fulness and completion of his desires.</p>
          <p>XLVI. Now Plato, being at the point of death, feli­ <lb/>
            citated himself on his daemon * and his fortune, first that <lb/>
            he was born a human being, then that he was a Greek, <lb/>
            and neither a barbarian nor an irrational animal; and <lb/>
            besides all this, that his birth had fallen on the time when <lb/>
            Socrates lived. And indeed it is said that Antipater t of <lb/>
            Tarsus, in like manner, just before his death, when <lb/>
            recapitulating the happiness that he had enjoyed, did not <lb/>
            forget his prosperous voyage from Rome to Athens, inas­ <lb/>
            much as he considered every gift of favourable fortune as <lb/>
            a thing to be thankful for, and preserved it to the last in <lb/>
            his memory, which is to man the best storehouse of good <lb/>
            things. But those who have no memory and no sense, let <lb/>
            the things that happen ooze away imperceptibly in the <lb/>
            course of time; and consequently, as they hold nothing <lb/>
            and keep nothing, being always empty of all goodness, but <lb/>
            full of expectation, they look to the future and throw <lb/>
            away the present. And yet fortune may hinder the <lb/>
            future, but the present cannot be taken from a man; <lb/>
            nevertheless, such men reject that which fortune now <lb/>
            gives, as something foreign, and dream of that which is <lb/>
            uncertain : and it is natural that they should; for before <lb/>
            reason and education have enabled them to put a founda­ <note type="footnote"> * See the note, Sulla (c. 6). </note><note type="footnote"> t He was a Stoic and the master of Panætius. His age is deter­ <lb/>

            tion and basement under external goods, they get and <lb/>
            they heap them together, and are never able to fill the <lb/>
            insatiate appetite of their soul. Now Marius * died, <lb/>
            having held for seventeen days his seventh consulship. <lb/>
            And immediately there were great rejoicings in Rome, <lb/>
            and good hope that there was a release from a cruel <lb/>
            tyranny; but in a few days men found that they had <lb/>
            exchanged an old master for a young one who was in the <lb/>
            fulness of his vigour; such cruelty and severity did the <lb/>
            son of Marius exhibit in putting to death the noblest <lb/>
            and best citizens. He gained the reputation of a man of <lb/>
            courage, and one who loved danger in his wars against <lb/>
            his enemies, and was named a con of Mars: but his acts <lb/>
            speedily showed his real character, and he received instead <lb/>
            the name of a son of Venus. Finally, being shut up in <lb/>
            Præneste by Bulla, and having in vain tried all ways of <lb/>
            saving his life, he killed himself when he saw that the <lb/>
            city was captured and all escape was hopeless. <note type="footnote">* See Life of Bulla (o. 28-32). Marius was consul with On. Papirius <lb/>
            Carbo, B.C. 82. Appian (Civil Wars, i. 87) says that this Marina was <lb/>
            the nephew of the distinguished Marius. There seems to be some <lb/>
            confusion about this younger Marina. (See o. 35.) </note></p><pb n="285"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF LYSANDER.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I, THE treasury of the Akanthians at Delphi has upon <lb/>
            it the following inscription : " The spoils which Brasidas <lb/>
            and the Akanthians took from the Athenians." For this <lb/>
            reason many suppose that the stone statue which stands <lb/>
            inside the treasure-chamber, just by the door, is that of <lb/>
            Brasidas ; but it is really a copy of a statue of Lysander, <lb/>
            wearing his hair and beard long, in the ancient fashion. <lb/>
            For it is not true, as some say, that when the Argives <lb/>
            after their great defeat shaved their hair in sign of <lb/>
            mourning, the Spartans on the other hand, in pride at <lb/>
            their victory let their hair grow long; nor was it because <lb/>
            the Bacchiadæ, when they fled from Corinth to Sparta <lb/>
            had their hair cut short, and looked mean and despicable <lb/>
            that made the Spartans, themselves eager to let their hair <lb/>
            grow long; but the fashion was enjoined by Lykurgus. <lb/>
            It is recorded that he said of this mode of wearing the <lb/>
            hair, that it made handsome men look handsomer, and <lb/>
            made ugly men look more ferocious.</p>
          <p>II. Aristokleitus, the father of Lysander, is said to <lb/>
            have been a descendant of Herakles, though not a member <lb/>
            of the royal family. Lysander was brought up in poverty, <lb/>
            and, like other Spartans, proved himself obedient to dis­ <lb/>
            cipline and of a manly spirit, despising all pleasures <lb/>
            except that which results from the honour paid to those <lb/>
            who are successful in some great action. This was the <lb/>
            only enjoyment permitted to young men in Sparta; for <lb/>
            they wish their children, from their very birth, to dread <lb/>
            reproach and to be eager for praise, and he who is not <lb/>
            stirred by these passions is regarded with contempt as a <lb/>
            sluggish fellow without ambition.</p>
          <p>Lysander retained throughout life the emulous desire for <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            fame which had been instilled into him by his early train­ <lb/>
            ing; but, though never wanting in ambition, yet he fell <lb/>
            short of the Spartan ideal, in his habit of paying court to <lb/>
            the great, and easily enduring the insolence of the power­ <lb/>
            ful, whenever his own interests were concerned. Aris­ <lb/>
            totle, when he observes that the temperaments of great <lb/>
            men are prone to melancholy, instances Sokrates, Plato, <lb/>
            and Herakles, and observes also that Lysander, when <lb/>
            advanced in life, became inclined to melancholy. What <lb/>
            is especially to be noted in his character is, that while he <lb/>
            himself lived in honourable poverty, and never received a <lb/>
            bribe from any one, that he nevertheless brought wealth <lb/>
            and the desire for wealth into his native country, and took <lb/>
            away from it its old boast of being superior to money; <lb/>
            for after the war with Athens he filled the city with gold <lb/>
            and silver, although he did not keep a drachma of it for <lb/>
            himself. When the despot Dionysius sent him some rich <lb/>
            Sicilian dresses for his daughters, he refused them, saying <lb/>
            that he feared they would make the girls look uglier <lb/>
            than before. However, being shortly afterwards sent as <lb/>
            ambassador to this same despot, when he again offered <lb/>
            him two dresses, bidding him take whichever he chose for <lb/>
            his daughter, he took them both away with him, saying <lb/>
            that she would be better able to choose for herself.</p>
          <p>III. Towards the end of the Peloponnesian war, the <lb/>
            Athenians, after their great disaster in Sicily, seemed likely <lb/>
            to lose the command of the sea, and even to be compelled <lb/>
            to sue for peace from sheer exhaustion. But Alkibiades, <lb/>
            after his return from exile, effected a great change in the <lb/>
            position of Athens, and raised the Athenian navy to such <lb/>
            a pitch that it was able to meet that of the Lacedæmon­ <lb/>
            ians on equal terms. At this the Lacedæmonians again <lb/>
            began to fear for the result of the war. They determined <lb/>
            to prosecute it with greater earnestness than before, and <lb/>
            as they required a skilful general, as well as a large force, <lb/>
            they gave Lysander the command of their fleet.</p>
          <p>When he came to Ephesus, he found the city friendly <lb/>
            to him, and willing enough to support the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            cause; but it was in a weak and ill-managed condition, <lb/>
            and in danger of falling into the Persian manners and <lb/>
            losing its Greek nationality, because it was close to Lydia. <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            and the Persian generals generally made it their head­ <lb/>
            quarters. But Lysander formed a camp there, ordered all <lb/>
            transports to be directed to sail thither, and established a <lb/>
            dockyard for the construction of ships of war. By this <lb/>
            means he filled the harbour with trading vessels, and the <lb/>
            market with merchandise, and brought money and busi­ <lb/>
            ness into every house and workshop; so that, thanks to <lb/>
            him, the city then first began to entertain hopes of <lb/>
            arriving at that pitch of greatness and splendour which <lb/>
            it has since attained.</p>
          <p>IV. When he heard that Cyrus, the son of the king of <lb/>
            Persia, had arrived at Sardis, he went thither to confer <lb/>
            with him, and to complain of the conduct of Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            who, although he received orders to assist the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, and to drive the Athenians from the sea, yet by <lb/>
            means of the influence of Alkibiades appeared to be very <lb/>
            much wanting in zeal for the Lacedæmonian cause, and <lb/>
            to be ruining their fleet by his parsimony. Cyrus gladly <lb/>
            listened to anything to the discredit of Tissaphernes, who <lb/>
            was a worthless man and also a personal enemy of his <lb/>
            own. After this Lysander gained considerable influence <lb/>
            with the young prince, and induced him to carry on the <lb/>
            war with greater spirit. When Lysander was about to <lb/>
            leave the court, Cyrus invited him to a banquet, and <lb/>
            begged him not to refuse his courtesies, but to demand <lb/>
            whatever boon he pleased, as he would be refused nothing. <lb/>
            Lysander replied, " Since, Cyrus, you are so very kind to <lb/>
            me, I ask you to add an obolus to the pay of the sailors, <lb/>
            so that they may receive four obols a day instead of three." <lb/>
            Cyrus, pleased with his warlike spirit, presented him with <lb/>
            ten thousand darics,* with which money he paid the <lb/>
            extra obolus to the sailors, and so improved the equipment <lb/>
            of his fleet, that in a short time he all but emptied the <lb/>
            enemy is ships; for their sailors deserted in crowds to the <lb/>
            best paymaster, and those who remained behind were so <lb/>
            disheartened and mutinous, that they gave their officers <lb/>
            continual trouble. Yet even after he had thus weakened <lb/>
            his enemy's forces Lysander dared not venture on a battle, <lb/>
            knowing Alkibiadee to be a brilliant general, and that his <note type="footnote"> * A Persian gold coin, first coined by Darius the son of Hystaspes. <lb/>

            fleet was still the more numerous, while his many victories <lb/>
            by sea and land made him feared at this period as invincible.</p>
          <p>V. When, however, Alkibiades sailed from Samos to <lb/>
            Phokeea he left his pilot Antiochus in command of the <lb/>
            fleet. This man, wishing in a foolhardy spirit to insult <lb/>
            Lysander, sailed into the harbour of Ephesus with two <lb/>
            triremes, and arrogantly passed along the beach where the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian fleet lay drawn up, with loud laughter and <lb/>
            noise. Lysander, enraged at this, at first only launched a <lb/>
            few triremes to pursue him, but when he saw the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians coming to his assistance he manned his whole fleet, <lb/>
            and brought on a general action. Lysander was vic­ <lb/>
            torious, took fifteen triremes, and erected a trophy. Upon <lb/>
            this the Athenian people were greatly incensed against <lb/>
            Alkibiades, and removed him from his command; and he, <lb/>
            being insulted and ill-treated by the soldiery at Samoa, <lb/>
            withdrew from the Athenian camp to the Chersonesus. <lb/>
            This battle, though not in itself remarkable, yet became <lb/>
            so because of the misfortunes which it brought upon <lb/>
            Alkibiades.</p>
          <p>Lysander now invited to Ephesus all the bravest and <lb/>
            most distinguished Greeks from the cities on the Ionic <lb/>
            coast, and thus laid the foundation of all those oligarchies <lb/>
            and revolutionary governments which were afterwards <lb/>
            established there, by encouraging them to form political <lb/>
            clubs, End devote themselves energetically to carrying on <lb/>
            the war, because in the event of success they would not <lb/>
            only conquer the Athenians, but also would be able to <lb/>
            put down all democratic government, and establish them­ <lb/>
            selves as absolute rulers in their respective cities. He <lb/>
            proved the truth of his professions to these people by his <lb/>
            acts, as he promoted those whom he personally knew, and <lb/>
            those with whom he was connected by the ties of hospi­ <lb/>
            tality, to important posts and commands, aiding and abet­ <lb/>
            ting their most unscrupulous and unjust acts, so that all <lb/>
            men began to look up to him and to be eager to win his <lb/>
            favour, imagining that if he remained in power, their <lb/>
            most extravagant wishes would be gratified. For this <lb/>
            reason they were dissatisfied with Kallikratidas, when he <lb/>
            took command of the fleet as Lysander's successor, and <lb/>
            even after he had proved himself to be as brave and honest <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            as a man could be, they still disliked his truthful, straight­ <lb/>
            forward, Dorian manners. Yet they could not but admire <lb/>
            his virtue, as men admire some antique heroic statue, <lb/>
            although they regretted Lysander's ready zeal for the <lb/>
            interest of his friends so much that some of them actually <lb/>
            wept when he sailed away.</p>
          <p>VI. Lysander made this class of persons yet more <lb/>
            irritated against Kallikratidas by sending back to Sardis <lb/>
            the balance of the money which he had received from <lb/>
            Cyrus for the fleet, bidding the sailors ask Kallikratidas <lb/>
            for pay, and see how he would manage to maintain the <lb/>
            men. And when he finally left Ephesus, he endeavoured <lb/>
            to force Kallikratidas to admit that he had handed over <lb/>
            to him a fleet which was mistress of the seas. Kallikra­ <lb/>
            tidas, however, wishing to expose his vainglorious boasts, <lb/>
            answered: "If so, sail from hence, passing Samos on <lb/>
            your left, and hand over the fleet to me at Miletus; for <lb/>
            we need not fear the Athenians at Samos, if our fleet is <lb/>
            mistress of the seas." To this Lysander answered that it <lb/>
            was not he, but Kallikratidas who was in command, and <lb/>
            at once sailed away to Peloponnesus, leaving Kallikratidas <lb/>
            in great perplexity; for he had brought no money with <lb/>
            him from his own country, and he could not endure to <lb/>
            wring money out of the distressed Greek cities on the <lb/>
            coast. There remained only one course open to him: to <lb/>
            go to the satraps of the king of Persia, and ask them for <lb/>
            money, as Lysander had done. Kallikratidas was the <lb/>
            worst man in the world for such a task, being high-spirited <lb/>
            and generous, and thinking it less dishonourable for Greeks <lb/>
            to be defeated by other Greeks than for them to court and <lb/>
            flatter barbarians who had nothing to recommend them <lb/>
            but their riches. Forced by want of money, however, he <lb/>
            made a journey into Lydia, and at once went to the house <lb/>
            of Cyrus, where he ordered the servants to say that <lb/>
            the admiral Kallikratidas was come, and wished to confer <lb/>
            with him. They answered, "Stranger, Cyrus is not at <lb/>
            leisure; he is drinking." To this Kallikratidas with the <lb/>
            greatest coolness replied: “Very well; I will wait until <lb/>
            he has finished his draught." At this answer the Persians <lb/>
            took him for a boor, and laughed at him, so that he went <lb/>
            away; and, after presenting himself a second time and <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> U </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            being again denied admittance, returned to Ephesus in a <lb/>
            rage, invoking curses upon those who had first been cor­ <lb/>
            rupted by the barbarians, and who had taught them to <lb/>
            behave so insolently because of their riches, and vowing <lb/>
            in the presence of his friends that as soon as he reached <lb/>
            Sparta, he would do all in his power to make peace between <lb/>
            the Greek states, in order that they might be feared by <lb/>
            the barbarians, and might no longer be obliged to beg the <lb/>
            Persians to help them to destroy one another.</p>
          <p>VII. But Kallikratidas, whose ideas were so noble and <lb/>
            worthy of a Spartan, being as brave, honourable, and just <lb/>
            a man as ever lived, perished shortly afterwards in the <lb/>
            sea-fight at Arginusæ. Upon this, as the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            cause was going to ruin, the allied cities sent an embassy <lb/>
            to Sparta, begging for Lysander to be again given the chief <lb/>
            command, and promising that they would carry on the <lb/>
            war with much greater vigour if he were their leader. <lb/>
            Cyrus also sent letters to the same effect. Now as the <lb/>
            Spartan law forbids the same man being twice appointed <lb/>
            admiral, the Lacedæmonians, wishing to please their allies, <lb/>
            gave the chief command nominally to one Arakus, but <lb/>
            sent Lysander with him, with the title of secretary, but <lb/>
            really with full power and authority. He was very welcome <lb/>
            to the chief men in the various cities, who imagined that <lb/>
            by his means they would be able to obtain much greater <lb/>
            power, and to put down democracy throughout Asia; but <lb/>
            those who loved plain and honourable dealing in a general <lb/>
            thought that Lysander, when compared with Kallikratidas, <lb/>
            appeared to be a crafty, deceitful man, conducting the war <lb/>
            chiefly by subtilty and stratagem, using honourable <lb/>
            means when it was his interest to do so, at other times <lb/>
            acting simply on the rules of expediency, and not holding <lb/>
            truth to be in itself superior to falsehood, but measuring <lb/>
            the value of the one and the other by the profit which was <lb/>
            to be obtained from them. He indeed laughed at those <lb/>
            who said that the race of Herakles ought not to make <lb/>
            wars by stratagem, saying, “Where the lion's skin will not <lb/>
            protect us, we must sew the fox's skin to it."</p>
          <p>VIII. All this is borne out by what he is said to have <lb/>
            done at Miletus. Here his friends and connections, to <lb/>
            whom he had promised that he would put down the demo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            era tic constitution and drive their enemies out of the city, <lb/>
            changed their minds, and made up their quarrel with their <lb/>
            political opponents. At this reconciliation Lysander <lb/>
            publicly expressed great satisfaction and even seemed <lb/>
            anxious to promote a good understanding, but in private <lb/>
            he railed at them and urged them to attack the popular <lb/>
            party. But as soon as he heard of an outbreak having <lb/>
            taken place, he at once marched into the city, addressed <lb/>
            the insurgents roughly, and sent them away in custody, <lb/>
            harshly treated, as if he meant to inflict some signal punish­ <lb/>
            ment upon them, while he bade those of the popular faction <lb/>
            take courage, and not to expect any ill-treatment while he <lb/>
            was present. By this artifice he prevailed upon the chief <lb/>
            men of the democratic party not to leave the city, but to <lb/>
            remain and perish in it; as indeed they did, for every <lb/>
            one who trusted to his word was put to death. Moreover, <lb/>
            Androkleides relates a story which shows Lysander's <lb/>
            extreme laxity with regard to oaths. He is said to <lb/>
            have remarked, that " We cheat boys with dice, and <lb/>
            men with oaths!" In this he imitated Polykrates, the <lb/>
            despot of Samos—an unworthy model for a Spartan <lb/>
            general. Nor was it like a Spartan to treat the gods as <lb/>
            badly as he treated his enemies, or even worse-for the <lb/>
            man who overreaches his enemy by breaking his oath <lb/>
            admits that he fears his enemy, but despises his god.</p>
          <p>IX. Cyrus now sent for Lysander to Sardis, and gave <lb/>
            him a supply of money, with promise of more. Nay, he <lb/>
            was so zealous to show his attachment to Lysander that <lb/>
            he declared, if his father would not furnish him with <lb/>
            funds, that he would expend all his own property, and if <lb/>
            other resources failed, that he would break up the gold <lb/>
            and silver throne on which he was sitting. Finally, when <lb/>
            he went away to Media to see his father, he empowered <lb/>
            Lysander to receive the tribute from the subject cities, <lb/>
            and placed the whole of his government in his hands. <lb/>
            He embraced Lysander, begged him not to fight the <lb/>
            Athenians by sea until he returned from court, promised <lb/>
            that he would return with many ships from Phœnicia and <lb/>
            Cilicia, and so departed.</p>
          <p>Lysander was not able to fight the Athenians on equal <lb/>
            terms, but yet he could not remain quiet with so large a <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            number of ships. He accordingly put out to sea, induced <lb/>
            several of the islands to revolt from Athens, and overran <lb/>
            Ægina and Salamis. At length he landed in Attica, <lb/>
            where he met Agis, who came down from Dekeleia to see <lb/>
            him, and showed the land army what his naval foroe was, <lb/>
            boasting that he could sail whither he pleased, and was <lb/>
            master of the seas. However, when he discovered that <lb/>
            the Athenians were in pursuit he fled precipitately back <lb/>
            to Asia Minor. Finding the Hellespont unguarded, he <lb/>
            attacked the city of Lampsakus by sea, while Thorax, <lb/>
            who had arrived at the same place with the land forces, <lb/>
            attacked it on that side. He took the city by storm, and <lb/>
            gave it up to his soldiers to plunder. Meanwhile, the <lb/>
            Athenian fleet of a hundred and eighty triremes had just <lb/>
            touched at Elaius in the Chersonese, but, hearing that <lb/>
            Lampsakus was lost, proceeded to Sestos. Having taken <lb/>
            in provisions at that place, they sailed to the “Goat's <lb/>
            Rivers," opposite to Lampsakus, where the enemy's fleet <lb/>
            still lay. One of the Athenian generals on this occasion <lb/>
            was that Philokles who once induced the people to pass a <lb/>
            decree that all prisoners of war should have their right <lb/>
            thumbs cut off, so that they might not be able to hold a <lb/>
            spear, but yet might work at the oar.</p>
          <p>X. Hereupon both parties rested, expecting a sea-fight <lb/>
            on the morrow. Lysander, however, had other intentions, <lb/>
            but notwithstanding ordered the sailors to man their <lb/>
            ships at day-break, as if he intended to fight, and to <lb/>
            remain quietly at their posts waiting for orders; and the <lb/>
            land force was similarly drawn up by the sea-side. When <lb/>
            the sun rose, the Athenian fleet rowed straight up to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and offered battle, but Lysander, although <lb/>
            his ships were fully manned, and had their prows pointing <lb/>
            towards the enemy, would not let them engage, but sent <lb/>
            small boats to the first line of his ships with orders not <lb/>
            to move, but remain quietly in their places without any <lb/>
            noise or attempt to attack. Though the Athenians retired <lb/>
            towards evening, he would not let his men land before <lb/>
            two or three triremes which he had sent to reconnoitre, <lb/>
            returned with the intelligence that the enemy had dis­ <lb/>
            embarked. The same manoeuvres took place on the next <lb/>
            day, and also on the third and fourth days, so that the <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            Athenians began to be very bold, and to despise their <lb/>
            enemy, who seemed not to dare to attack them. At this <lb/>
            time Alkibiades, who was living in his own forts in the <lb/>
            Chersonese, rode over to the Athenian camp and blamed <lb/>
            the generals for having in the first place encamped in a <lb/>
            bad position, on an exposed sea-beach without any harbour, <lb/>
            and pointed out their mistake in having to fetch all their <lb/>
            provisions from Sestos, which was so far off, whereas they <lb/>
            ought to have proceeded to the harbour and city of Sestos, <lb/>
            where they would also be farther away from a watchful <lb/>
            enemy, commanded by one general only, and so well <lb/>
            disciplined as to be able to carry out his orders with great <lb/>
            rapidity. These representations of Alkibiades were not <lb/>
            listened to by the Athenian generals, one of whom, <lb/>
            Tydeus, insolently replied that it was they, not he, who <lb/>
            were in command.</p>
          <p>XI. As besides this Alkibiades had some suspicions of <lb/>
            treachery among them, he rode away. On the fifth day <lb/>
            however, when the Athenians, after their customary offer <lb/>
            of battle, had returned as usual, in a careless and negligent <lb/>
            manner, Lysander sent out some ships to reconnoitre, <lb/>
            with orders to row back again with all speed as soon as <lb/>
            they saw the Athenians disembark, and when they reached <lb/>
            the middle of the straits to hoist a brazen shield over their <lb/>
            bows as a signal for advance. He himself sailed from <lb/>
            ship to ship, addressing the steersmen and captains of <lb/>
            each,. urging them to be in their place with their full <lb/>
            complement both of rowers and fighting-men on deck, and <lb/>
            at the signal to row strongly and cheerfully against the <lb/>
            enemy.</p>
          <p>When the shield was raised, and the signal given by <lb/>
            trumpet from the flag-ship, the fleet put to sea, while the <lb/>
            land force marched rapidly along the shore towards the <lb/>
            promontory. The straits here are only fifteen furlongs <lb/>
            wide, a distance which was soon passed by the zeal of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian rowers. Konon was the first of the <lb/>
            Athenian generals who perceived the fleet approaching. <lb/>
            He at once called out to the men to embark, and in his <lb/>
            agony of distress at the disaster, ordered, implored, and <lb/>
            forced them into their ships. But all his zeal was useless, <lb/>
            scattered as the crews were; for as soon as they disem­ <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            barked they at once, not expecting any attack, began <lb/>
            some to purchase food in the market, some to stroll about, <lb/>
            while some went to sleep in their tents, and some began <lb/>
            to cook, without the least mistrust of that which befel <lb/>
            them, through the ignorance and inexperience of their <lb/>
            leaders. As by this lime the enemy were close upon <lb/>
            them, with loud cries and noise of oars, Konon with <lb/>
            eight ships made his way safely through the enemy, and <lb/>
            escaped to the court of Evagoras, king of Cyprus. As to <lb/>
            the rest of the ships, the Peloponnesians took some of them <lb/>
            empty, and sank the others as the sailors endeavoured to <lb/>
            get on board of them. Of these men, many perished near <lb/>
            their ships, as they ran to them in disorderly crowds, <lb/>
            without arms, while others who fled away on land were <lb/>
            killed by the enemy, who landed and went in pursuit of <lb/>
            them. Besides these, three thousand men, including the <lb/>
            generals, were taken prisoners. Lysander also captured <lb/>
            the entire fleet, with the exception of the sacred trireme <lb/>
            called the Paralus, and the eight ships which escaped with <lb/>
            Konon. After plundering the camp, and taking all the <lb/>
            captured ships in tow, he sailed back to Lampsakus with <lb/>
            triumphal music of flutes and paeans of victory, having <lb/>
            won a great victory with little labour, and in a short time <lb/>
            brought to a close the longest and most uncertain war <lb/>
            ever known in his times. There had been innumerable <lb/>
            battles, and frequent changes of fortune, in which more <lb/>
            generals had perished than in all the previous wars <lb/>
            in Greece, and yet all was brought to a close by the <lb/>
            wisdom and conduct of one man: which thing caused <lb/>
            some to attribute this victory to the interposition of <lb/>
            the gods.</p>
          <p>XII. Some affirmed, that when Lysander's ship sailed <lb/>
            out of the harbour of Lampsakus to attack the enemy, <lb/>
            they saw the Dioskuri, like two stars, shining over the <lb/>
            rudders.- Some also say that the fall of the great stone <lb/>
            was an omen of this disaster: for the common belief is <lb/>
            that a vast stone fell down from Heaven into the Goat's <lb/>
            Rivers, which stone is even now to be seen, and is wor­ <lb/>
            shipped by the people of the Chersonese. We are told <lb/>
            that Anaxagoras foretold that in case of any slip or dis­ <note type="footnote"> * All ancient ships were managed with two rudders. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            turbance of the bodies which are fixed in the heavens, <lb/>
            they would all fall down. The stars also, he said, are <lb/>
            not in their original position, but being heavy bodies <lb/>
            formed of stone, they shine by the resistance and friction <lb/>
            of the atmosphere, while they are driven along by the <lb/>
            violence of the circular motion by which they were <lb/>
            originally prevented from falling, when cold and heavy <lb/>
            bodies were separated from the general universe. There <lb/>
            is a more credible theory on this subject, that shooting- <lb/>
            stars are not a rush of aerial fire which is put out as soon <lb/>
            as it is kindled, nor yet a blaze caused by a quantity <lb/>
            of air being suddenly allowed to rush upwards, but <lb/>
            that they are heavenly bodies, which from some failure in <lb/>
            their rotatory power, fall from their orbit and descend, <lb/>
            not often into inhabited portions of the earth, but for the <lb/>
            most part into the sea, whereby they escape notice. This <lb/>
            theory of Anaxagoras is confirmed by Daimachus in his <lb/>
            treatise on Piety, where he states that for seventy-five <lb/>
            days before the stone fell a fiery body of great size like a <lb/>
            burning cloud, was observed in the heavens. It did not <lb/>
            remain at rest, but moved in various directions by short <lb/>
            jerks, so that by its violent swaying about many fiery <lb/>
            particles were broken off, and flashed like shooting-stars. <lb/>
            When, however, it sank to the earth, the inhabitants, <lb/>
            after their first feeling of terror and astonishment were <lb/>
            passed, collected together, and found no traces of fire, but <lb/>
            merely a stone lying on the ground, which although a <lb/>
            large one, bore no comparison to that fiery mass. It is <lb/>
            evident that this tale of Daimachus can only find credit <lb/>
            with indulgent readers: but if it be true, it signally con­ <lb/>
            futes those who argue that the stone was wrenched by <lb/>
            the force of a whirlwind from some high cliff, carried up <lb/>
            high into the air, and then let fall whenever the violence <lb/>
            of the tempest abated. Unless, indeed, that which was <lb/>
            seen for so many days was really fire, which, when <lb/>
            quenched, produced such a violent rushing and motion in <lb/>
            the air as tore the stone from its place. A more exact <lb/>
            enquiry into these matters, however, belongs to another <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>XIII. Now Lysander, after the three thousand Athenians <lb/>
            whom be had taken prisoners had been condemned to death <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            by the council, called for Philokles their general, and <lb/>
            asked him what punishment he thought that he deserved <lb/>
            for having advised his fellow-countrymen to treat Greeks <lb/>
            in such a cruel manner.- Philokles, not in the least cast <lb/>
            down by his misfortunes, bade him not to raise questions <lb/>
            which no one could decide, but, since he was victor, to do <lb/>
            what he would himself have suffered if vanquished. He <lb/>
            then bathed, put on a splendid dress, and led his country­ <lb/>
            men to execution, according to the account given by Theo­ <lb/>
            phrastus. After this Lysander sailed to the various cities <lb/>
            in the neighbourhood, and compelled all the Athenians <lb/>
            whom he met to betake themselves to Athens, giving out <lb/>
            that he would spare no one, but put to death all whom he <lb/>
            found without the city. His object in acting thus was to <lb/>
            produce famine in Athens as speedily as possible, that the <lb/>
            city might not give him the trouble of a long siege. He <lb/>
            now destroyed the democratics and popular constitutions <lb/>
            in all the Greek cities which had been subject to Athens, <lb/>
            placing a Lacedæmonian in each as harmost or governor, <lb/>
            with a council of ten archons under him, composed of men <lb/>
            selected from the political clubs which he had established. <lb/>
            He proceeded leisurely along, effecting these changes alike <lb/>
            in the cities which had been hostile to him and in those <lb/>
            which had fought on his side, as though he were preparing <lb/>
            for himself a Greece in which he would take the first place. <lb/>
            He did not choose his archons by their birth, or their <lb/>
            wealth, but favoured his own friends and political ad­ <lb/>
            herents, to whom he gave irresponsible power; while by <lb/>
            being present at several executions, and driving the <lb/>
            opponents of his friends into exile, he gave the Greeks a <lb/>
            very unpleasant idea of what they were to expect from <lb/>
            the empire of Lacedæmon. The comic poet Theopompus <lb/>
            therefore appears to talk at random when he compares the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians to tavern-keepers, because they at first <lb/>
            poured out for the Greeks a most sweet draught of liberty <lb/>
            and afterwards made it bitter; whereas in truth the taste <lb/>
            of their rule was bitter from the beginning, as Lysander <lb/>
            would not allow the people to have any voice in the <note type="footnote"> * Alluding to the cruelties practised by Philokles on the Andrians <lb/>
            and Corinthians, and the decree for the mutilation of the captives, of <lb/>
            which Philokles was the author. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            government, and placed all the power in each city in the <lb/>
            hands of the most daring and ambitious men of the <lb/>
            oligarchical party.</p>
          <p>XIV. After spending a short time in arranging these <lb/>
            matters and having sent messengers to Laconia to <lb/>
            announce that he was coming thither with a fleet of two <lb/>
            hundred ships, he joined the Spartan kings, Agis and <lb/>
            Pausanias, in Attica, and expected that the city of Athens <lb/>
            would soon fall into his hands. Finding, however, that <lb/>
            the Athenians made an obstinate defence, he crossed over <lb/>
            to Asia again with the fleet. Here he overthrew the <lb/>
            existing constitutions and established governments of ten <lb/>
            in all the cities alike, putting many citizens to death, and <lb/>
            driving many into exile. He drove out all the inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants from the island of Samos in a body, and handed over <lb/>
            the cities in that island to those who had previously been <lb/>
            banished. He also took Sestos from the Athenians, and <lb/>
            would not allow the people of Sestos to live there, but <lb/>
            gave the city and territory over to those who had acted as <lb/>
            steersmen and masters on board of his ships. This indeed <lb/>
            was the first of his acts which was cancelled by the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, who restored Sestos to its inhabitants. <lb/>
            Yet his proceedings were viewed with satisfaction by the <lb/>
            Greeks, when he restored the Æginetans, who had for a <lb/>
            long time been banished from their island, and also <lb/>
            refounded Melos and Skione, the Athenians being driven <lb/>
            away and forced to give up the cities.</p>
          <p>By this time he learned that the people of Athens were <lb/>
            nearly starved out, and consequently sailed to Peiræus <lb/>
            and received the submission of the city, which was obliged <lb/>
            to accept whatever terms of capitulation he chose to offer. <lb/>
            I have indeed heard Lacedæmonians say that Lysander <lb/>
            wrote to the Ephors, saying " Athens is taken;" and that <lb/>
            they wrote to Lysander in answer, " To have taken it is <lb/>
            enough." But this tale is merely invented for effect. <lb/>
            The real decree of the Ephors ran as follows:—“ This is <lb/>
            the decision of the Lacedæmonian government. Throw <lb/>
            down the walls of Peiraeus and the Long Walls. Withdraw <lb/>
            from all other cities and occupy your own land, and then <lb/>
            you may have peace, if you wish for it, allowing likewise <lb/>
            your exiles to return. With regard to the number of the <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            ships, whatever be judged necessary by those on the spot, <lb/>
            that do."</p>
          <p>The Athenians accepted these terms, by the advice of <lb/>
            Theramenes the son of Hagnon : and on this occasion it is <lb/>
            said that when he was asked by Kleomenes, one of the <lb/>
            younger orators, how he dared to act and speak against <lb/>
            what Themistokles had done, by giving upto the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians those walls which Themistokles had built <lb/>
            in spite of them, he answered, "My boy, I am doing <lb/>
            nothing contrary to Themistokles; for these same walls <lb/>
            he built up to save his countrymen, and we will throw <lb/>
            them down to save them. Indeed, if walls made a city <lb/>
            prosperous, then ought Sparta, which has none, to be the <lb/>
            most miserable of all."</p>
          <p>XV. Now Lysander, after taking all the fleet of the <lb/>
            Athenians except twelve ships, and having taken possession <lb/>
            of their walls, began to take measures for the subversion <lb/>
            of their political constitution, on the sixteenth day of the <lb/>
            month Munychion, the same day on which they had <lb/>
            defeated the Persians in the sea-fight at Salamis. As they <lb/>
            were greatly grieved at this, and were loth to obey him, <lb/>
            he sent word to the people that the city had broken the <lb/>
            terms of its capitulation, because their walls were stand­ <lb/>
            ing although the time within which they ought to have <lb/>
            been destroyed had elapsed. He therefore would make <lb/>
            an entirely new decision about their fate, because they <lb/>
            had broken the treaty. Some writers say that he actually <lb/>
            consulted the allies about the advisability of selling the <lb/>
            whole population for slaves, in which debate the Theban <lb/>
            Erianthus proposed to destroy the city and make the <lb/>
            site of it a sheep walk. Afterwards, however, when the <lb/>
            generals were drinking together a Phokian sang the first <lb/>
            song in the Elektra of Euripides, which begins with the <lb/>
            words­ <lb/>
            “Elektra, Agamemnon's child, <lb/>
            I reach thy habitation wild." <lb/>
            At this their hearts were touched, and it appeared to <lb/>
            them to be a shameful deed to destroy so famous a city, <lb/>
            and one which had produced such great men. After this, <lb/>
            as the Athenians agreed to everything that Lysander <lb/>
            proposed, he sent for a number of flute-players out of the <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            city, collected all those in his camp, and destroyed the <lb/>
            walls and burned the ships to the sound of music, while <lb/>
            the allies crowned themselves with flowers and danced <lb/>
            around, as though on that day their freedom began. <lb/>
            Lysander now at once subverted the constitution, estab­ <lb/>
            lishing thirty archons in the city, and ten in Peiræus, <lb/>
            placing also a garrison in the Acropolis under the <lb/>
            command of Kallibius, who acted as harmost, or governor. <lb/>
            This man once was about to strike Autolykus the athlete, <lb/>
            in whose house Xenophon has laid the scene of his <lb/>
            " Symposium,” with his staff, when Autolykus tripped <lb/>
            him and threw him down. Lysander did not sympathise <lb/>
            with his fall, but even reproached him, saying that he did <lb/>
            not know how to govern free men. However, the Thirty, to <lb/>
            please Kallibius, shortly afterwards put Autolykus to death.</p>
          <p>XVI. After these transactions Lysander set sail for <lb/>
            Thrace, but sent home to Sparta all the money for which <lb/>
            he had no immediate occasion, and all the presents and <lb/>
            crowns * which he had received, in charge of Gylippus, <lb/>
            who had held a command in Sicily during the war there. <lb/>
            His wealth was very great, as many naturally had <lb/>
            bestowed rich presents on one who had such great power <lb/>
            as to be in some sort dictator of Greece. Gylippus is said <lb/>
            to have cut open the seam at the bottom of each bag of <lb/>
            money, taken a great deal of it out, and then to have <lb/>
            sewn it up again, not knowing that there was a written <lb/>
            note in each bag stating the amount which it contained. <lb/>
            When he reached Sparta he hid the money which he had <lb/>
            stolen under the tiles of his roof, and handed the bags <lb/>
            over to the Ephors with the seals unbroken. When the <lb/>
            bags were opened and the money counted, the amount <lb/>
            was found not to agree with the written notes, and the <lb/>
            Ephors were much perplexed at this until a servant of <lb/>
            Gylippus explained the cause of it in a riddle, telling <lb/>
            them that under his tiles roosted many owls. For, it <lb/>
            seems, most of the money current at that period bore the <lb/>
            Athenian device of the owl, in consequence of the extent <lb/>
            of the Athenian empire. <note type="footnote"> * Golden crowns, at this period of Greek history, was the name <lb/>
            applied to large sums of money voted by cities to men whose favour <lb/>
            they hoped to gain. </note> <pb n="300"/>
            </p>
          <p>Gylippus, having sullied the glory of his great achieve­ <lb/>
            ments by this mean and sordid action, left Sparta in <lb/>
            disgrace. Yet the wisest Spartans, fearing the power of <lb/>
            the money for this very reason, that it was the chief men <lb/>
            in the state who would be tempted by it, reproached <lb/>
            Lysander for bringing it, and implored the Ephors to <lb/>
            convey solemnly all the gold and silver coin away out of <lb/>
            the country, as being so much “imported ruin." On this <lb/>
            the Ephors invited discussion upon the subject. Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus tells us that it was Skiraphidas, but Ephorus <lb/>
            says that it was Phlogidas who advised the Spartans not <lb/>
            to receive the gold and silver coinage into their country, <lb/>
            but to continue to use that which their fathers had used. <lb/>
            This was iron money, which had first been dipped in <lb/>
            vinegar when red hot, so that it could not be worked, as <lb/>
            its being quenched in this manner rendered it brittle and <lb/>
            useless, while it was also heavy, difficult to transport from <lb/>
            place to place, and a great quantity of it represented but <lb/>
            a small value. It appears probable that all money was <lb/>
            originally of this kind, and that men used instead of coin <lb/>
            small spits * of iron or copper. For this reason we still <lb/>
            call small coins obols, and we call six obols a drachma, <lb/>
            meaning that this is the number of them which can be <lb/>
            grasped by the hand.</p>
          <p>XVII. The motion for sending away the money was <lb/>
            opposed by Lysander's friends, who were eager to keep it <lb/>
            in the state; so that it was at last decided that for public <lb/>
            purposes this money might be used, but that if any private <lb/>
            person were found in possession of it, he should be put to <lb/>
            death: as if Lykurgus had been afraid of money itself, <lb/>
            and not of the covetousness produced by it, which they did <lb/>
            not repress by forbidding private men to own money so <lb/>
            much as they encouraged it by permitting the state to <lb/>
            own it, conferring thereby a certain dignity upon it over <lb/>
            and above its real value. It was not possible for men <lb/>
            who saw that the state valued silver and gold to despise <lb/>
            it as useless, or to think that what was thus prized by <lb/>
            the whole body of the citizens could be of no concern to <lb/>
            individuals. On the contrary, it is plain that national <lb/>
            customs much sooner impress themselves on the lives and <note type="footnote"> *A spit is called obelus in Greek. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            manners of individuals, than do the faults and vices <lb/>
            of individuals affect the national character. When the <lb/>
            whole becomes corrupt the parts necessarily become <lb/>
            corrupt with it; but the corruption of some of the parts <lb/>
            does not necessarily extend to the whole, being checked <lb/>
            and overpowered by those parts which remain healthy. <lb/>
            Thus the Spartans made the law and the fear of death <lb/>
            guard the houses of their citizens so that money could not <lb/>
            enter them, but they did not guard their minds against <lb/>
            the seductions of money, nay, even encouraged them to <lb/>
            admire it, by proclaiming that it was a great and im­ <lb/>
            portant matter that the commonwealth should be rich. <lb/>
            However, I have discussed the conduct of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians in this respect in another book.</p>
          <p>KVIII. From the proceeds of the plunder which he had <lb/>
            taken Lysander set up a brazen statue of himself and of <lb/>
            each of the admirals * at Delphi, and also offered up golden <lb/>
            stars to the Dioskuri, which stars disappeared just before <lb/>
            the battle of Leuktra. Besides this, in the treasury of <lb/>
            Brasidas and the Akanthians there used to be a trireme <lb/>
            made of gold and ivory, two cubits long, which was sent <lb/>
            to him by Cyrus as a present on the occasion of his victory. <lb/>
            Anaxandrides of Delphi also tells us that Lysander de­ <lb/>
            posited there a talent of silver, fifty-two minæ, and eleven <lb/>
            of the coins called staters, which does not agree with the <lb/>
            accounts given by other writers of his poverty.</p>
          <p>At this time Lysander was more powerful than any <lb/>
            Greek had ever been before, and displayed an amount of <lb/>
            pride and arrogance beyond even what his power war­ <lb/>
            ranted. He was the first Greek, we are told by Douris <lb/>
            in his history, to whom cities erected altars and offered <lb/>
            sacrifice as though he were a god, and he was the first in <lb/>
            whose honour paeans were sung, one of which is recorded <lb/>
            as having begun as follows : <lb/>
            “The praise of our fair Græcia's king <lb/>
            That cornes from Sparta, let us sing, <lb/>
            Io pæan.” <lb/>
            Nay, the Samians decreed that their festival, called Heræs <note type="footnote"> *Probably of each of the Spartan admirals who had commanded <lb/>
            during the war. It should be remembered that Lysander was not <lb/>
            nominally admiral when he won the battle of Ægospotami. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            in honour of Hera, should be called Lysandreia. He <lb/>
            always kept the poet Chœrilus in his train, that be might <lb/>
            celebrate his actions in verse, and when Antilochus wrote <lb/>
            some stanzas in his praise he was so pleased that he filled <lb/>
            his hat with silver and gave it to him. Antimachus of <lb/>
            Kolophon and one Nikeratus of Heraklea each wrote a poem <lb/>
            on his deeds, and competed before him for a prize, at the <lb/>
            Lysandreia. He gave the crown of victory to Nikeratus, <lb/>
            which so enraged Antimachus that he suppressed his poem. <lb/>
            Plato, who was a young man at that time, and admired the <lb/>
            poetry of Antimachus, consoled him for his defeat by point­ <lb/>
            ing out to him that the illiterate are as much to be pitied <lb/>
            for their ignorance as the blind are for their loss of sight. <lb/>
            When, however, the harper Aristonous, who had six times <lb/>
            won the victory at the Pythian games, to show his regard <lb/>
            to Lysander, told him that if he won the prize again he <lb/>
            intended to have his name proclaimed by the herald as <lb/>
            Lysander's servant, Lysander said, “Does he mean to <lb/>
            proclaim himself my slave ? "</p>
          <p>XIX. This ambition of Lysander was only a burden <lb/>
            to the great, and to those of equal rank with himself. <lb/>
            TInt as none dared to thwart him, his pride and insolence <lb/>
            of temper became intolerable. He proceeded to ex­ <lb/>
            travagant lengths both when he rewarded and when he <lb/>
            punished, bestowing absolute government over important <lb/>
            cities upon his friends, while he was satisfied with nothing <lb/>
            short of the death of an enemy, and regarded banishment <lb/>
            as too mild a sentence. Indeed, when subsequently to <lb/>
            this he feared lest the chiefs of the popular party at <lb/>
            Miletus might escape, and also wished to tempt those who <lb/>
            had concealed themselves to leave their hiding-place, he <lb/>
            swore that he would not harm them ; and when they, <lb/>
            trusting to his word, came forward and gave themselves <lb/>
            up, he delivered them over to the aristocratical party to <lb/>
            be put to death, to the number of not less than eight <lb/>
            hundred men. In all the other cities, too, an indis­ <lb/>
            criminate massacre of the popular party took place, as <lb/>
            Lysander not only put to death his own personal enemies, <lb/>
            but also those persons against whom any of his friends in <lb/>
            each city might happen to have a grudge. Wherefore <lb/>
            Eteokles the Lacedæmonian was thought to have spoken <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            well, when he said that “Greece could net have borne <lb/>
            two Lysanders." We are told by Theophrastus that <lb/>
            Archestratus made the same remark about Alkibiades : <lb/>
            although in his case it was insolence, luxury and self-will <lb/>
            which gave so much offence, whereas Lysander's harsh, <lb/>
            merciless disposition was what made his power so hateful <lb/>
            and terrible.</p>
          <p>At first the Lacedæmonians paid no attention to com­ <lb/>
            plaints brought against him; but when Pharnabazus, <lb/>
            who had been wronged by Lysander's depredations on his <lb/>
            country, sent an embassy to Sparta to demand justice, the <lb/>
            Ephors were much enraged. They put to death Thorax, <lb/>
            one of his friends, whom they found in possession of silver <lb/>
            coin, and they sent a skytale to him bidding him appear <lb/>
            before them. I will now explain what a skytale was. <lb/>
            When the Ephors sent out any one as general or admiral <lb/>
            of their forces, they used to prepare two round sticks of <lb/>
            wood of exactly the same length and thickness, corre­ <lb/>
            sponding with one another at the ends. One of these <lb/>
            they kept themselves, and the other they gave to the <lb/>
            person sent out. These sticks they call sky tales. Now <lb/>
            when they desire to transmit some secret of importance to <lb/>
            him, they wrap a long narrow strip of paper * like a strap <lb/>
            round the skytale which is in their possession, leaving no <lb/>
            intervals, but completely covering the stick along its <lb/>
            whole length with the paper. When this has been done <lb/>
            they write upon the paper while it is upon the stick, and <lb/>
            after writing they unwind the paper and send it to the <lb/>
            general without the stick. When he receives it, it is <lb/>
            entirely illegible, as the letters have no connection, but he <lb/>
            winds it round the stick in his possession so that the folds <lb/>
            correspond to one another, and then the whole message <lb/>
            can be read. The paper is called skytale as well as the <lb/>
            stick, as a thing measured is called by the name of the <lb/>
            measure.</p>
          <p>XX. Lysander, when this skytale reached him at the <lb/>
            Hellespont, was much troubled, and as he especially feared <lb/>
            the accusations of Pharnabazus, he hastened to confer with <lb/>
            him, with a view to settling their dispute. When they <note type="footnote"> * The Greek word probably means papyrus. dough translates it <lb/>
            “parchment."—cf. Aulus Gellius, xvii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            met, Lysander begged him to write a second letter to the <lb/>
            Spartan government, stating that he had not received any <lb/>
            wrong, and that he had no charge to bring against him. <lb/>
            It was, however, a case of "diamond cut diamond," as <lb/>
            the proverb has it, for Pharnabazus, while he ostensibly <lb/>
            promised to do everything that Lysander wished, and <lb/>
            to send publicly a letter dictated by him, had by him <lb/>
            another privately-written despatch, and when the seals <lb/>
            were about to be affixed, as the two letters looked exactly <lb/>
            alike, he substituted the privately-written one for that <lb/>
            which Lysander had seen. When then Lysander reached <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, and proceeded, as it customary, to the senate- <lb/>
            house, he handed over to the Ephors this letter of Pharna­ <lb/>
            bazus, with the conviction that thereby he was quashing <lb/>
            the most important of all the charges against himself; <lb/>
            for Pharnabazus was much loved by the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            because he had taken their part in the war more zealously <lb/>
            than any other Persian satrap. When, however, the <lb/>
            Ephors showed him the letter, and he perceived that <lb/>
            ‘ ‘ Others besides Odysseus * can contrive," he retired in <lb/>
            great confusion, and a few days afterwards, on meeting <lb/>
            with the Ephors, informed them that he must go and pay <lb/>
            a sacrifice to Ammon'f which he had vowed before winning <lb/>
            his victories. Some historians tell us that this was true, <lb/>
            and that when he was besieging Aphytæ, a city in <lb/>
            Thrace, the god Ammon appeared to him in a dream ; in <lb/>
            consequence of which he raised the siege, imagining this <lb/>
            to be the will of the god, ordered the inhabitants to <lb/>
            sacrifice to Ammon, and himself made preparations for <lb/>
            proceeding at once to Libya to propitiate the god. Most <lb/>
            persons, however, imagined that this was a mere pretence, <lb/>
            but that really he feared the Ephors, and was unable to <lb/>
            endure the harsh discipline of life at Sparta, and therefore <lb/>
            wished to travel abroad, just as a horse longs for liberty <lb/>
            when he has been brought back out of wide pastures to <lb/>
            his stable and his accustomed work. As to the cause <note type="footnote"> * Ulysses. </note><note type="footnote"> t An Egyptian divinity, represented with ram's horns, and identified <lb/>

            which Ephorus gives for these travels of his, I will <lb/>
            mention that presently.</p>
          <p>XXI. After having with great difficulty obtained <lb/>
            permission from the Ephors, he set sail. Now as soon as <lb/>
            he left the country, the two kings, perceiving that by <lb/>
            means of his device of governing the cities of Greece by <lb/>
            aristocratic clubs devoted to his interest he was virtually <lb/>
            master of the whole country, determined to restore the <lb/>
            popular party to power and to turn out Lysander's friends. <lb/>
            When however this movement was set on foot, and when <lb/>
            first of all the Athenians starting from Phyle attacked the <lb/>
            Thirty and overpowered them, Lysander returned in haste, <lb/>
            and prevailed upon the Lacedæmonians to assist the cause <lb/>
            of oligarchy and put down these popular risings. They <lb/>
            decided that the first government which they would aid <lb/>
            should be that of the Thirty, at Athens ; and they proposed <lb/>
            to send them a hundred talents for the expenses of the war, <lb/>
            and Lysander himself as their general. But the two <lb/>
            kings, envying his power, and fearing that he would <lb/>
            take Athens a second time, determined that one of them­ <lb/>
            selves should proceed thither in his stead. Pausanias <lb/>
            accordingly went to Athens, nominally to assist the Thirty <lb/>
            against the people, but really to put an end to the war, <lb/>
            for fear that Lysander by means of his friends might a <lb/>
            second time become master of Athens. This he easily <lb/>
            effected; and by reconciling all classes of Athenians to <lb/>
            one another and putting an end to the revolution, he made <lb/>
            it impossible for Lysander to win fresh laurels. But when <lb/>
            shortly afterwards the Athenians again revolted he was <lb/>
            much blamed for having allowed the popular party to gather <lb/>
            strength and break out of bounds, after it had once been <lb/>
            securely bridled by an oligarchy, while Lysander on the <lb/>
            contrary gained the credit of having, in every city, <lb/>
            arranged matters not with a view to theatrical effect, but <lb/>
            to the solid advantage of Sparta.</p>
          <p>XXII. He was bold in his speech, and overbearing to <lb/>
            those who opposed him. When the Argives had a dispute <lb/>
            with the Lacedæmonians about their frontier, and seemed <lb/>
            to have justice on their side, Lysander drew his sword, <lb/>
            saying, “ He that is master of this is in possession of <lb/>
            the best argument about frontier lines." When some <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            Megarian in a public meeting used considerable freedom <lb/>
            of speech towards him, he answered, “ My friend, your <lb/>
            words require a city. to back them." He asked the <lb/>
            Bœotians, who wished to remain neutral, whether he <lb/>
            should pass through their country with spears held <lb/>
            upright or levelled. On the occasion of the revolt of <lb/>
            Corinth, when he brought up the Lacedæmonians to <lb/>
            assault their walls, he observed that they seemed un­ <lb/>
            willing to attack. At this moment a hare was seen to <lb/>
            leap across the ditch, upon which he said, " Are you not <lb/>
            ashamed to fear such enemies as these, who are so lazy as <lb/>
            to allow hares to sleep upon their walls ?" When king <lb/>
            Agis died, leaving a brother, Agesilaus, and a son Leoty­ <lb/>
            chides who was supposed to be his, Lysander, who was <lb/>
            attached to Agesilaus, prevailed upon him to lay claim to <lb/>
            the crown as being a genuine descendant of Herakles. For <lb/>
            Leotychides laboured under the imputation of being the <lb/>
            son of Alkibiades, who carried on an intrigue with <lb/>
            Timæa the wife of Agis, when he was living in Sparta <lb/>
            as an exile. It is said that Agis, after making a cal­ <lb/>
            culation about the time of his wife's pregnancy treated <lb/>
            Leotychides with neglect and openly denied that he was <lb/>
            his father. When however he was brought to Heræa <lb/>
            during his last illness, and was at the point of death, he was <lb/>
            induced by the entreaties of the youth and his friends to <lb/>
            declare in the presence of many witnesses that Leotychides <lb/>
            was his legitimate son, and died begging them to testify <lb/>
            this fact to the Lacedæmonians. They did indeed so <lb/>
            testify in favour of Leotychides ; and although Agesilaus <lb/>
            was a man of great distinction, and had the powerful <lb/>
            assistance of Lysander, yet his claims to the crown were <lb/>
            seriously damaged by one Diopeithes, a man deep read in <lb/>
            oracular lore, who quoted the following prophecy in <lb/>
            reference to the lameness of Agesilaus: <lb/>
            "Proud Sparta, resting on two equal feet, <lb/>
            Beware lest lameness on thy kings alight; <lb/>
            Lest wars unnumbered toss thee to and fro, <lb/>
            And thou thyself be ruined in the fight."</p>
          <p>But when many were persuaded by this oracle and <note type="footnote"> * Megara was always treated by the Greeks with the utmost con­ <lb/>
            tempt, as possessing no importance, political or otherwise. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            looked to Leotychides as the true heir, Lysander said that <lb/>
            they did not rightly understand it; for what it meant <lb/>
            was, he argued, not that the god forbade a lame man to <lb/>
            i eign, but that the kingdom would be lame of one foot if <lb/>
            base-born men should share the crown with those who <lb/>
            were of the true race of Herakles. By this argument <lb/>
            and his own great personal influence he prevailed, and <lb/>
            Agesilaus became king of Sparta.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Lysander now at once began to urge him to <lb/>
            make a campaign in Asia, holding out to him hopes of <lb/>
            conquering the Persians and making himself the greatest <lb/>
            man in the world. He also wrote to his friends in Asia, <lb/>
            bidding them ask the Lacedæmonians to send them Age­ <lb/>
            silaus to act as their commander in chief in the war with <lb/>
            the Persians. They obeyed, and sent an embassy to <lb/>
            demand him: which was as great an honour to Agesilaus <lb/>
            as his being made king, and which, like the other, he owed <lb/>
            to Lysander alone. However, ambitious natures, though <lb/>
            in other respects fit for great commands, often fail in <lb/>
            important enterprises through jealousy of their rivals; <lb/>
            for they make those men their opponents who would <lb/>
            otherwise have been their assistants in obtaining success. <lb/>
            On this occasion Agesilaus took Lysander with him, as the <lb/>
            chief of his board of thirty counsellors, and treated him as <lb/>
            his greatest friend; but when they reached Asia, the <lb/>
            people there would not pay their court to Agesilaus, whom <lb/>
            they did not know, while all Lysander's friends flocked <lb/>
            round him to renew their former intimacy, and all those <lb/>
            who feared him assiduously courted his favour. Thus, as <lb/>
            in a play we often see that a messenger or servant <lb/>
            engrosses all the interest of the spectators and really acts <lb/>
            the leading part, while he who wears the crown and bears <lb/>
            the sceptre is hardly heard to speak, so now it was the <lb/>
            counsellor who obtained all the honours due to a com­ <lb/>
            mander in chief, while the king had merely the title <lb/>
            without any influence whatever. It was necessary, no <lb/>
            doubt, that this excessive power of Lysander should be <lb/>
            curtailed, and he himself forced to take the second place: <lb/>
            but yet to disgrace and ruin a friend and one from whom <lb/>
            he had received great benefits, would have been unworthy <lb/>
            of Agesilaus. Consequently at first he did not entrust <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            him with the conduct of matters of importance, and did <lb/>
            not give him any separate command. In the next place, <lb/>
            he invariably disobliged, and refused the applications, of <lb/>
            any persons on whose behalf he understood Lysander to <lb/>
            be interested, and thus gradually undermined his power. <lb/>
            When however after many failures Lysander perceived <lb/>
            that his interest on his friends' behalf was a drawback <lb/>
            rather than an advantage to them, he ceased from urging <lb/>
            their claims, and moreover begged them not to pay their <lb/>
            court to him, but to attach themselves to the king, and <lb/>
            to those who were able to promote and reward their <lb/>
            followers. Most of them on hearing this no longer <lb/>
            troubled him on matters of business, but continued on the <lb/>
            most friendly terms with him, and angered Agesilaus more <lb/>
            than ever by the manner in which they flocked round <lb/>
            him in public places and walks, showing thereby their <lb/>
            dislike to the king. Agesilaus now bestowed the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of cities and the conduct of important expeditions <lb/>
            upon various obscure soldiers, but appointed Lysander his <lb/>
            carver, and then in an insulting manner told the lonians <lb/>
            to go and pay their court to his carver. At this Lysander <lb/>
            determined to have an interview with him, and there took <lb/>
            place a short and truly Laconian dialogue between them. <lb/>
            Lysander said, “ You know well, Agesilaus, how to <lb/>
            humble your friends." "Yes," answered he, " if they <lb/>
            desire to be greater than I am: but those who increase <lb/>
            my power have a right to share it." “ Perhaps," said <lb/>
            Lysander, “ you have spoken better than I have acted; <lb/>
            however, if it be only on account of the multitude whose <lb/>
            eyes are upon us, I beg you to appoint me to some post <lb/>
            in which I may be of more use to you, and cause you less <lb/>
            annoyance than at present."</p>
          <p>XXIV. Upon this he was sent on a special mission to <lb/>
            the Hellespont, where although he was at enmity with <lb/>
            Agesilaus, he did not neglect his duty, but, finding that <lb/>
            the Persian Spithridates, a man of noble birth and com­ <lb/>
            manding a considerable force, was on bad terms with <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, he induced him to revolt, and brought him <lb/>
            back with him to Agesilaus. After this Lysander was <lb/>
            given no further share in the conduct of the war, and <lb/>
            after some time sailed back to Sparta in disgrace, full of <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            rage against Agesilaus, and hating the whole Spartan <lb/>
            constitution more than ever. He now determined without <lb/>
            any further delay to put in practice the revolutionary <lb/>
            plans which he had so long meditated. These were as <lb/>
            follows :— When the descendants of Herakles, after asso­ <lb/>
            ciating with the Dorians, returned to Peloponnesus, their <lb/>
            race grew and flourished at Sparta. Yet it was not every <lb/>
            family of the descendants of Herakles, but only the <lb/>
            children of Eurypon and Agis who had a right to the <lb/>
            throne, while the others gained no advantage from their <lb/>
            noble birth, as all honours in the state were given <lb/>
            according to merit. Now Lysander, being a descendant <lb/>
            of Herakles, after he had gained great glory by his <lb/>
            achievements and obtained many friends and immense <lb/>
            influence, could not endure that the state should reap such <lb/>
            groat advantages from his success, and yet continue to bo <lb/>
            ruled by men of no better family than himself. He <lb/>
            meditated, therefore, the abolition of the exclusive right <lb/>
            to the throne possessed by these two families, and throw­ <lb/>
            ing it open to all the descendants of Herakles, or even, <lb/>
            according to some historians, to all Spartans alike, in order <lb/>
            that the crown might not belong to the descendants of <lb/>
            IIerakles, but to those who were judged to be like Herakles <lb/>
            in glory, which had raised Herakles himself to a place <lb/>
            among the gods themselves. If the throne were disposed <lb/>
            of in this manner he imagined that no Spartan would be <lb/>
            chosen king before himself.</p>
          <p>XXV. First then he proposed to endeavour to win over <lb/>
            his countrymen to his views by his own powers of persua­ <lb/>
            sion, and with this object studied an oration written for <lb/>
            him by Kleon of Halikarnassus. Soon, however, he per­ <lb/>
            ceived that so new and important a scheme of reform <lb/>
            would require more violent means to carry it into effect, <lb/>
            and, just as in plays supernatural machinery is resorted to <lb/>
            where ordinary human means would fail to produce the <lb/>
            wished-for termination, even so did Lysander invent <lb/>
            oracular responses and prophecies and bring them to bear <lb/>
            on the minds of his countrymen, feeling that he would <lb/>
            gain but little by pronouncing Kleon's oration, unless the <lb/>
            Spartans had previously, by superstition and religious <lb/>
            terrors, been brought into a state of feeling suitable for <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            its reception. Ephorus relates in his history that Lysander <lb/>
            endeavoured by means of one Pherekles to bribe the <lb/>
            priestess at Delphi, and afterwards those of Dodona; and <lb/>
            that, as this attempt failed, he himself went to the oracle <lb/>
            of Ammon and had an interview with the priests there, to <lb/>
            whom he offered a large sum of money. They also <lb/>
            indignantly refused to aid his schemes, and sent an <lb/>
            embassy to Sparta to charge him with having attempted <lb/>
            to corrupt them. He was tried and acquitted, upon <lb/>
            which the Libyans, as they were leaving the country, <lb/>
            said :—“ We at any rate, 0 Spartans, will give more <lb/>
            righteous judgments when you come to dwell amongst <lb/>
            us "-for there is an ancient oracle which says that the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians shall some day settle in Libya. Now as <lb/>
            to the whole framework of Lysander's plot, which was of <lb/>
            no ordinary kind, and did not take its rise from accidental <lb/>
            circumstances, but consisted, like a mathematical demon­ <lb/>
            stration, of many complicated intrigues all tending to one <lb/>
            fixed point, I will give a short abstract of it extracted from <lb/>
            the works of Ephorus, who was both an historian and a <lb/>
            philosopher.</p>
          <p>XXVI. There was a woman in Pontus who gave out <lb/>
            that she was pregnant by Apollo. As might be expected, <lb/>
            many disbelieved in hor pretensions, but many more <lb/>
            believed in them, so that when a male child was born of <lb/>
            her, it was cared for and educated at the charge of many <lb/>
            eminent persons. The child, for some reason or other, was <lb/>
            given the name of Silenus. Lysander, starting with these <lb/>
            materials, constructed the rest of the story out of his own <lb/>
            imagination. He was assisted in his scheme by many <lb/>
            persons of the highest respectability, who unsuspiciously <lb/>
            propagated the fable about the birth of the child: and <lb/>
            who also procured another mysterious story from Delphi, <lb/>
            which they carefully spread abroad at Sparta, to the effect <lb/>
            that some oracles of vast antiquity are guarded by the <lb/>
            priests at Delphi, in writings which it is not lawful to <lb/>
            read ; nor may any one examine them or look upon them, <lb/>
            until in the fulness of time one born of Apollo shall come, <lb/>
            and after clearly proving his birth to the guardians of <lb/>
            these writings, shall take the tablets which contain them. <lb/>
            This having been previously arranged, Silenus's part <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            was to go and demand the oracles as Apollo's child, while <lb/>
            those of the priests who were in the plot were to make <lb/>
            inquiries and examine carefully into his birth, and at <lb/>
            length were to appear convinced of the truth of the story, <lb/>
            and show the writings to him, as being really the child <lb/>
            of Apollo. He was to read aloud in the presence of <lb/>
            many persons all the oracles contained in the tablets, <lb/>
            especially one which said that it would be better for the <lb/>
            Spartans to choose their kings from the best of the <lb/>
            citizens. Silenus was nearly grown up, and the time to <lb/>
            make the attempt had almost arrived, when the wholo <lb/>
            plot was ruined by the cowardice of one of the principal <lb/>
            conspirators, whose heart failed him when the moment for <lb/>
            action arrived. None of these particulars, however, were <lb/>
            discovered till after Lysander's death.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Before Agesilaus returned from Asia Lysan­ <lb/>
            der perished in a Bœotian war in which he had become <lb/>
            involved, or rather had involved Greece; for various <lb/>
            accounts are given of it, some laying the blame upon him, <lb/>
            some upon the Thebans, and some upon both. It was urged <lb/>
            against the Thebans that they overturned the altar at <lb/>
            Aulis and scattered the sacrifice,. and also that Andro­ <lb/>
            kleides and Amphitheus, having been bribed by Persia to <lb/>
            induce all the Greek states to attack the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            had invaded the Phokian territory and laid it waste. On <lb/>
            the other hand Lysander is said to have been angry that <lb/>
            the Thebans alone should claim their right to a tenth part <lb/>
            of the plunder obtained in the war, though the other allies <lb/>
            made no such demand, and that they should have expressed <lb/>
            indignation at Lysander's sending such large sums of <lb/>
            money to Sparta. He was especially wroth with them <lb/>
            for having afforded the Athenians the means of freeing <lb/>
            themselves from the domination of the Thirty, which he <lb/>
            had himself established, and which the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            had "endeavoured to support by decreeing that all exiled <lb/>
            Athenians of the popular party might be brought back <note type="footnote"> * Agesilaus offered sacrifice at Aulis, in imitation of Agamemnon, <lb/>
            before starting for Asia. But before he had completed the rite, the <lb/>
            Bœotarchs sent a party of horse to enjoin him to desist, and the men did <lb/>
            not merely deliver the message, but scattered the parts of the victim which <lb/>
            they found on the altar.—Thirlwall's History of Greece, ch. XXXV. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            to Athens from whatever place they might be found in, <lb/>
            and that those who protected them against being furcibly <lb/>
            brought back should be treated as outlaws. In answer to <lb/>
            this the Thebans passed a decree worthy of themselves and <lb/>
            deserving of comparison with the great acts of Herakles <lb/>
            and Dionysus, the benefactors of mankind. Its provisions <lb/>
            were, that every city and every house in Bœotia should <lb/>
            be open to those Athenians who required shelter, that <lb/>
            whoever did not assist an Athenian exile against any one <lb/>
            who tried to force him away should be fined a talent, <lb/>
            and that if any marched under arms through Bœotia tc <lb/>
            attack the despots at Athens, no Theban should either see <lb/>
            or hear them. Not only did they make this kindly and truly <lb/>
            Hellenic decree, but they also acted up to the spirit of it; <lb/>
            for when Thrasybulus and his party seized Phyle, they <lb/>
            started from Thebes, supplied with arms and necessaries <lb/>
            by the Thebans, who also assisted them to keep their <lb/>
            enterprise secret and to begin it successfully. These were <lb/>
            the charges brought against the Thebans by Lysander.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. His naturally harsh temper was now soured by <lb/>
            age, and he urged on the Ephors into declaring war against <lb/>
            the Thebans, and appointing him their general to carry it on. <lb/>
            Subsequently, however, they sent the king, Pausanias, with <lb/>
            an army, to co-operate with him. Pausanias marched in a <lb/>
            circuitous course over Mount Kithæron, meaning to invade <lb/>
            Bœotia on that side, while Lysander with a large force <lb/>
            came to meet him through Phokis. He took the city of <lb/>
            Orchomenus, which voluntarily came over to his side, and <lb/>
            he took Lebadeia by storm and plundered it. He now <lb/>
            sent a letter to Pausanias bidding him march through the <lb/>
            territory of Platæa and join him at Haliartus, promising <lb/>
            that at day break he would be before the walls of Haliartus. <lb/>
            The messenger who carried this letter fell into the hands <lb/>
            of the enemy, and the letter was taken to Thebes. Here­ <lb/>
            upon the Thebans entrusted their city to the care cf the <lb/>
            Athenians, who had come to their aid, and themselves <lb/>
            started early in the evening, reached Haliartus a little <lb/>
            before Lysander, and threw a body of troops into the <lb/>
            town. Lysander, on discovering this, at first determined <lb/>
            to halt his army on a hill in the neighbourhood and await <lb/>
            the arrival of Pausanias : but as the day went on ho could <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            remain quiet no longer, but got his men under arms, <lb/>
            harangued the allied troops, and led them in a close <lb/>
            column down the road directly towards the city. Upon <lb/>
            this those of the Thebans who had remained outside the <lb/>
            walls, leaving the city on their left hand, marched to <lb/>
            attack the extreme rear of the Lacedæmonians, near the <lb/>
            fountain which is called Kissousa,* in which there is a <lb/>
            legend that Dionysus was washed by his nurses after his <lb/>
            birth; for the water is wine-coloured and clear, and very <lb/>
            sweet-tasted. Round the fountain is a grove of the Cretan <lb/>
            Storax-tress,† which the people of Haliartus point to as a <lb/>
            proof of Rhadamanthus having lived there. They also <lb/>
            show his tomb, which they call Alea. The sepulchre of <lb/>
            Alkmena too is close by: for the story goes that she <lb/>
            married Rhadamanthus here after the death of Amphitryon. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the Thebans in the city, together with the <lb/>
            citizens of Haliartus themselves, remained quiet until <lb/>
            Lysander and the first ranks of the enemy came close to <lb/>
            the walls, and then suddenly opening the gates they <lb/>
            charged and slew him together with his soothsayer and <lb/>
            some few more: for most of them fled quickly back to the <lb/>
            main body. However as the Thebans did not desist but <lb/>
            pressed on, the whole mass took to flight and escaped to <lb/>
            the neighbouring hills with a loss of about one thousand <lb/>
            men. Three hundred of the Thebans also fell in an attack <lb/>
            which they made on the enemy in rough and difficult <lb/>
            ground. These men had been accused of favouring the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and it was to wipe out this unjust <lb/>
            imputation before the eyes of their fellow citizens that <lb/>
            they showed themselves so reckless of their lives.</p>
          <p>XXIX. When Pausanias heard of this disaster, he was <lb/>
            marching from Platæa towards Thespiae. He at once put his <lb/>
            troops in array and proceeded to Haliartus. Here likewise <lb/>
            arrived Thrasybulus from Thebes, with an Athenian force. <lb/>
            On his arrival, Pausanias proposed to apply for permission <note type="footnote"> * The name of this fountain should probably be corrected from <lb/>
            Strabo and Pausanias, and read Tilphusa, or Tilphosa.—Langhorne. </note><note type="footnote"> t Strabo tells us, Haliartus was destroyed by the Romans in the <lb/>
            war with Perseus. He also mentions a lake nei' it, which produ es <lb/>
            canes or reeds, not for shafts of javelins, but for pipes or flutes. Com­ <lb/>
            pare Plutarch's Life of Bulla, ch. xx. adfin. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            to carry away the dead. This proposal greatly shocked <lb/>
            the older Spartans, who could not refrain from going to <lb/>
            the king and imploring him not to receive back Lysander'a <lb/>
            corpse by a truce * which was in itself a confession of <lb/>
            defeat, but to let them fight for his body and either bury <lb/>
            it as victors, or else to share their general's fate as became <lb/>
            them. However, in spite of these representations, Pausanias, <lb/>
            perceiving that it would be no easy task to overcome the <lb/>
            Thebans, flushed as they were with the victory of the day <lb/>
            before, and that, as Lysander's body lay close under the <lb/>
            walls of the town, it would be almost impossible, even if <lb/>
            they were victorious, to recover it otherwise than by <lb/>
            treaty, sent a herald, obtained the necessary truce, and <lb/>
            led away his forces. As soon as the Spartans crossed the <lb/>
            Bœotian frontier they buried the body of Lysander in <lb/>
            the territory of the friendly and allied city of Panope, in <lb/>
            Phokis, where at the present day his monument stands by <lb/>
            the side of the road from Chæronea to Delphi.† It is said <lb/>
            that while the army was encamped there one of the <lb/>
            Phokians, while describing the battle to another who had <lb/>
            not been present, said that the enemy fell upon them just <lb/>
            after Lysander had crossed the Hoplites.t A Spartan who <lb/>
            was present was surprised at this word, and enquired <lb/>
            of Lysander's friend, what he meant by the Hoplites, for <lb/>
            he did not understand it. “ It was where," answered he, <lb/>
            " the enemy overthrew our front ranks ; for they call the <lb/>
            stream which runs past the city the Hoplites." On hearing <lb/>
            these words the Spartan burst into tears, and exclaimed, <lb/>
            “ How impossible is it for a man to escape his fate :” -for <lb/>
            it seems Lysander had received an oracular warning in <lb/>
            these words: <lb/>
            "I warn thee, shun Hoplites roaring track, <lb/>
            And th<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign> earth-born snake that stings behind thy back." <note type="footnote">* The Greeks attached great importance to the burial of the dead, <lb/>
            and after a battle, that party which demanded a truce for collecting <lb/>
            and burying its dead was thought to have admitted itself to have bee u <lb/>
            defeated. Naturally, therefore, the proposal was regarded as humi­ <lb/>
            liating by the Spartans of 395 B.O. </note><note type="footnote"> t It should be remembered that Chæronea was Plutarch's own city, <lb/>
            and that he was a priest at Delphi, and, consequently, was especially <lb/>
            familiar with the country here described. </note><note type="footnote"> I Hoplites, in Greek, usually means a warrior fully armed. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            Some say that the Hoplites does not run by Haliartus, but <lb/>
            that it is the name of a torrent which joins the river <lb/>
            Philarus near Koronea, which used to be called the <lb/>
            Hoplias, and is now called Isomantus. The man who <lb/>
            killed Lysander was a citizen of Haliartus named Neo­ <lb/>
            chorus, who bore a snake as the device upon his shield, <lb/>
            which it is supposed was alluded to by the oracle.</p>
          <p>We are also told that during the Peloponnesian war the <lb/>
            Thebans received an oracle from Apollo Ismenius, referring <lb/>
            immediately to the battle of Delium, and also to this <lb/>
            battle at Haliartus, which took place thirty years after­ <lb/>
            wards. It ran as follows: <lb/>
            Beware the boundary, when you hunt <lb/>
            The wolf with spears; <lb/>
            And shun the Orchalian hill, the fox's haunt, <lb/>
            For endless years." <lb/>
            The boundary alludes to the country near Delium, which <lb/>
            is on the borders of Attica and Boeotia, and the Orchalian <lb/>
            hill, which is now called Fox-hill, lies in the territory of <lb/>
            Haliartus, on the side nearest Mount Helikon.</p>
          <p>XXX. The death of Lysander, as related above, grieved <lb/>
            the Spartans so much that they impeached their king on <lb/>
            a capital charge, and he, fearing the result of the trial, <lb/>
            fled to Tegea, where he spent the remainder of his life in <lb/>
            the sanctuary of Athena as a suppliant of the goddess. <lb/>
            Moreover the poverty of Lysander, which was discovered <lb/>
            after his death, made his virtue more splendid, for al­ <lb/>
            though he had handled great sums of money, and pos­ <lb/>
            sessed immense power; though his favour had been courted <lb/>
            by wealthy cities, and even by the great king of Persia <lb/>
            himself, yet Theopompus tells us that he did not in the <lb/>
            least degree improve his family estate : an account which <lb/>
            we may the more readily believe, as it is told us by a <lb/>
            historian who is more prone to censure than to admiration. <lb/>
            In later times we learn from the historian Ephorus that <lb/>
            some dispute arose between the allied cities which ren­ <lb/>
            dered it necessary to examine Lysander's papers, and that <lb/>
            Agesilaus went to his house for this purpose. Here he <lb/>
            found the scroll upon which was written the speech about <lb/>
            altering the constitution, advising the Spartans to abolish <lb/>

            the hereditary right to the throne enjoyed by the old <lb/>
            royal families of Eurypon and Agis, and to throw it open <lb/>
            to the best of the citizens without restriction. Agesilaus <lb/>
            was eager to publish this speech abroad, and show his <lb/>
            fellow-countrymen what sort of a man Lysander had really <lb/>
            been; but Lakratides, a wise man, who was at that timo <lb/>
            chief of the board of Ephors, restrained him, pointing <lb/>
            out that it would be wrong to disturb Lysander in his <lb/>
            grave, and that it would be better that so clever and <lb/>
            insidious a composition should be buried with him. <lb/>
            Among other honours which were paid to Lysander after <lb/>
            death, the Spartans fined the suitors of his daughters, <lb/>
            because when after his death his poverty was discovered, <lb/>
            they refused to marry them, thus showing that they had <lb/>
            paid their court to him when they believed him to be <lb/>
            rich, and neglected him when his poverty proved him to <lb/>
            have been just and honourable. It appears that in Sparta <lb/>
            there were actions at law against men who did not marry, <lb/>
            or who married too late in life or unbecomingly: under <lb/>
            which last head came those who tried to marry into rich <lb/>
            families, instead of marrying persons of good birth and <lb/>
            their own friends. This is what we have fo nd to tell <lb/>
            about the life of Lysander.</p><pb n="317"/>

          <p>I. LUCIUS CORNELIUS SULLA,* by birth, belonged to the <lb/>
            Patricians, whom we may consider as corresponding to the <lb/>
            Eupatridæ. Among his ancestors is enumerated Rufinus,† <note type="footnote"> * Many distinguished families belonged to the Cornelii, as the <lb/>
            Scipiones, Lentuli, Dolabellæ, and others. The Patricians were the <lb/>
            old Roman noble families, whom Plutarch compares with the Athenian <lb/>
            Eupatridæ, or men of noble family, who formed in the older periods of <lb/>
            Athenian history the first class in the State. <lb/>
            The origin of the word Sulla is uncertain. This Sulla was not the <lb/>
            first who bore it. P. Cornelius Rufinus, Prætor B.O. 212, the grand­ <lb/>
            father of this Sulla, also bore the name. The various conjectures on <lb/>
            the origin of the name Sulla are given by Drumaun, Geschichte Roms, <lb/>
            ii. p. 426. The name should be written Sulla, not Sylla. The coins <lb/>
            have always Sulla or Sula. (Rasche, Lex Rei Numariæ; Eckhel, <lb/>
            Doctrina Num. Vet. v. 189.) L. Cornelius Sulla was the son of L. <lb/>
            Cornelius Sulla, and born B.O. 138. </note><note type="footnote"> t P. Cornelius Rufinus was consul B.O. 290. He was also Dictator, <lb/>
            but in what year is uncertain. He was ejected from the Senate by <lb/>
            the Censor C. Fabricius B.O. 275 for violating one of the sumptuary <lb/>
            laws of Rome, or those which limited expense. The story is mentioned <lb/>
            by Gellius (iv. 8; xvii. 21). Plutarch has translated the Latin word <lb/>
            Libræ by the Greek Litræ. </note><note type="footnote"> The Romans made many enactments for limiting expense in dress, <lb/>
            entertainments, funerals (Sulla, c. 35), amount of debt to be incurred, <lb/>
            and so forth, all of which were unavailing. The notion of regulating <lb/>
            private expenditure was not peculiar to the Romans among the states <lb/>
            of antiquity; and our own legislation, which in its absurd as well as <lb/>
            its best parts has generally some parallel in that of the Romans, coil­ <lb/>
            tains many instances of sumptuary laws, which prescribed what kind <lb/>
            of dress, and of what quality, should be worn by particular classes, <lb/>
            and so forth. The English Sumptuary Statutes relating to Apparel <lb/>
            commenced with the 37th of Edward III. This statute, after dock­ <lb/>
            in- that the outrageous and excessive apparel of divers people against <lb/>
            their estate and degree is the destruction and impoverishment of the <lb/>
            land, prescribes the apparel of the various clashes into which it distri­ <lb/>
            butes the people; but it goes no higher than knights. The clothing </note> <lb/>

            who became consul; but is less noted for attaining this <lb/>
            honour than for the infamy which befell him. He was de­ <lb/>
            tected in possessing above ten pounds' weight of silver plate, <lb/>
            which amount the law did not permit, and he was ejected <lb/>
            from the Senate. His immediate descendants continued <lb/>
            in a mean condition, and Sulla himself was brought up <lb/>
            with no great paternal property. When he was a young <lb/>
            man he lived in lodgings, for which he paid some moderate <lb/>
            sum, which he was afterwards reproached with, when ho <lb/>
            was prospering beyond his deserts, as some thought. It <lb/>
            was after the Libyan expedition, when he was assuming <lb/>
            airs of importance and a haughty tone, that a man of high <lb/>
            rank and character said to him, How can you be an honest <lb/>
            man who are now so rich, and yet your father left you <lb/>
            nothing ? For though the Romans no longer remained true <lb/>
            to their former integrity and purity of morals, but had <lb/>
            declined from the old standard, and let in luxury and <lb/>
            expense among them, they still considered it equally a <lb/>
            matter of reproach for a man to have wasted the property <lb/>
            that he once had, and not to remain as poor as his ancestors. <lb/>
            Subsequently when Sulla was in the possession of power <lb/>
            and was putting many to death, a man of the class of <lb/>
            Libertini, who was suspected of concealing a proscribed <lb/>
            person, and for this offence was going to be thrown down <lb/>
            the Tarpeian rock, reproached Sulla with the fact that <lb/>
            they had lived together for some time in one house; that <lb/>
            he had paid two thousand sestertii for his lodgings, which <lb/>
            were in the upper part of the house, and Sulla three thou­ <lb/>
            sand for the lower rooms ; and, consequently, that between <lb/>
            their fortunes there was only the difference of a thousand <lb/>
            sestertii, which is equivalent to two hundred and fifty <lb/>
            Attic drachmae. This is what is recorded of Sulla's early <lb/>
            condition.</p>
          <p>II. As for his person, we may judge of it by his statues, <lb/>
            except his eyes and complexion. His eyes were an un­ <lb/>
            commonly pure and piercing blue, which the colour of <note type="footnote"> of the women and children id aUso regulated. The next statute, 3rd of <lb/>
            Edward IV., is very minute. This kind of statute-making went on <lb/>
            at. intervals to the 1st of Philip &amp; Mary, when an Act was passed for <lb/>
            the Reformation of Excessive AppareL These Apparel Statutes were <lb/>
            repealed by the 1st of James L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            his face rendered still more terrific, being spotted with <lb/>
            rough red blotches, interspersed with the white; from <lb/>
            which circumstance, it is said, he got his name bulla, <lb/>
            which had reference to his complexion; and one of the <lb/>
            Athenian satirists * in derision made the following verse <lb/>
            in allusion to it: <lb/>
            “ Sulla is a mulberry besprinkled with meal."</p>
          <p>It is not out of place to avail ourselves of such traits of <lb/>
            a man who is said to have had so strong a natural love of <lb/>
            buffoonery, that when he was still young and of no repute, <lb/>
            he spent his time and indulged himself among mimi † <lb/>
            and jesters ; and when he was at the head of the state, he <lb/>
            daily got together from the scena and the theatre the <lb/>
            lewdest persons, with whom he would drink and enter <lb/>
            into a contest of coarse witticisms, in which he had no <lb/>
            regard to his age, and, besides degrading the dignity of <lb/>
            his office, he neglected many matters that required atten­ <lb/>
            tion. It was not Sulla's habit when he was at table to <lb/>
            trouble himself about anything serious, but though he was <lb/>
            energetic and rather morose at other times, he underwent a <lb/>
            complete change as soon as he went into company and was <lb/>
            seated at an entertainment, for he was then exceedingly <lb/>
            complaisant to singers of mimi and dancers, and easy of <lb/>
            access and affable. This habit of relaxation seems to <lb/>
            have produced in him the vice of being exceedingly <lb/>
            addicted to women and that passion for enjoyment which <lb/>
            stuck to him to his old age. In his youth he was for a <note type="footnote"> * This word does not convey the exact notion, but it is sufficient. <lb/>
            The original is Gephyrists (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γεφυρισταί</foreign>). There was, they say, a <lb/>
            bridge (Gephyra) on the road between Athens and Eleusis, from which, <lb/>
            during the sacred processions to Eleusis, the people (or, as some <lb/>
            authorities say, the women) were allowed the liberty of joking and <lb/>
            saying what they pleased ; and hence the name of such free speakers, <lb/>
            Bridgers, Bridge-folk. (See Casaubon's note on Strabo, p. 400.) <lb/>
            Hence the word came to signify generally abusive people. Sulla did <lb/>
            not forget these insults when he took Athens (c. 13). Plutarch alludes <lb/>
            to this also in his Treatise on Garrulity, c. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> t Mimus is a name given by the Romans both to an actor and to a <lb/>
            kind of dramatic performance, which probably resembled a coarse farce, <lb/>
            and was often represented in private houses. Its distinguishing <lb/>
            character was a want of decency. The word Mimus is of Greek origin, <lb/>
            and probably derived its name from the amount of gestures and action <lb/>
            used in these performances. The Greeks also had their Mimi. </note> <lb/>

            long time attached to one Metrobius,* an actor. The <lb/>
            following incident also happened to him :— He formed an <lb/>
            attachment to a woman named Nicopolis, who was of <lb/>
            mean condition, but rich, and from long familiarity and <lb/>
            the favour which he found on account of his youth, he <lb/>
            came to be considered as a lover, and when the woman <lb/>
            died she left him her heir. He also succeeded to the <lb/>
            inheritance of his step-mother, who loved him as her own <lb/>
            son ; and in this way he acquired a moderate fortune.</p>
          <p>III. On being appointed Quæstor to Marius in his first <lb/>
            consulship, he sailed with him to Libya, to prosecute <lb/>
            the war against Jugurtha.† In this campaign he showed <lb/>
            himself a man of merit, and by availing himself of a <lb/>
            favourable opportunity he made a friend of Bocchus, king <lb/>
            of the Numidians. Some ambassadors of Bocchus who <lb/>
            had escaped from Numidian robbers were hospitably <lb/>
            received by Sulla, and sent back with presents and a safe <lb/>
            conduct. Now Bocchus happened for some time to have <lb/>
            disliked his son-in-law Jugurtha, whom he was also afraid <lb/>
            of; and as Jugurtha had been defeated by the Romans <lb/>
            and had fled to Bocchus, he formed a design to make him <lb/>
            his prisoner and deliver him to his enemies; but as he <lb/>
            wished Sulla to be the agent rather than himself, he <lb/>
            invited Sulla to come and see him. Bulla communicated <lb/>
            the message to Marius, and, taking a few soldiers with <lb/>
            him, ventured on the hazardous enterprise of putting <lb/>
            himself in the hands of a barbarian who never kept his <lb/>
            faith even with his friends, and this for the purpose of <lb/>
            having another man betrayed to him. Bocchus, having <lb/>
            got both of them in his power, was under the necessity <lb/>
            of being treacherous to one of them, and after great <lb/>
            fluctuations in his resolution, he finally carried into effect <lb/>
            his original perfidious design, and surrendered Jugurtha <lb/>
            to Sulla. Marius enjoyed the triumph for the capture of <lb/>
            Jugurtha, but the honour of the success was given to <lb/>
            Sulla through dislike of Marius, which caused Marius <lb/>
            some uneasiness; for Bulla was naturally of an arrogant <lb/>
            disposition, and as this was the first occasion on which <note type="footnote"> * This passage is apparently corrupt. But the general meaning is <lb/>
            tolerably cle ar. Sulla, c. 36.) </note><note type="footnote"> t See Marius, c. 10. </note> <lb/>

            he had been raised from a mean condition and obscurity <lb/>
            to be of some note among his fellow-citizens, and had <lb/>
            tasted the sweets of distinction, he carried his pride so <lb/>
            far as to have a seal-ring cut, on which the occurrence was <lb/>
            represented, and he wore it constantly. The subject <lb/>
            represented was Bocchus surrendering and Sulla receiving <lb/>
            the surrender of Jugurtha.</p>
          <p>IV. Though Marius was annoyed at this, yet as he still <lb/>
            thought Sulla beneath his jealousy, he employed him in <lb/>
            his campaigns-in his second consulship in the capacity <lb/>
            of legate, and in his third consulship as tribune;* and <lb/>
            by his instrumentality Marius effected many important <lb/>
            objects. In his capacity of legate Sulla took Copillius, <lb/>
            king of the Tectosages ;f and when he was a tribune he <lb/>
            persuaded the powerful and populous nation of the <lb/>
            Marsi‡ to become friends and allies to Rome. But now <lb/>
            perceiving that Marius was jealous of him, and was no <lb/>
            longer willing to give him the opportunity of distinguish­ <lb/>
            ing himself, but opposed his further rise, Sulla attached <lb/>
            himself to Catulus, the colleague of Marius, who was an <lb/>
            honest man, but inactive as a soldier. Sulla being <lb/>
            entrusted by Catulus with all matters of the greatest <lb/>
            moment, thus attained both influence and reputation. In <lb/>
            his military operations he reduced a large part of the <lb/>
            Alpine barbarians; and on one occasion, w hen there was <lb/>
            a scarcity of provisions in the camp, he undertook to <lb/>
            supply the want, which he did so effectually that the <lb/>
            soldiers of Catulus had not only abundance for themselves, <lb/>
            but were enabled to relieve the army of Marius. This, as <lb/>
            Bulla himself says, greatly annoyed Marius. Now this <lb/>
            enmity, so slight and childish in its foundation and <note type="footnote"> * Tribunus Militum, a military tribune. Plutarch translates the <lb/>

            origin, was continued through civil war and the inve­ <lb/>
            terate animosity of faction, till it resulted in tht establish­ <lb/>
            ment of a tyranny and the complete overthrow of the <lb/>
            constitution; which shows that Euripides * was a wise <lb/>
            man and well acquainted with the diseases incident to <lb/>
            states, when he warned against ambition, as the most <lb/>
            dangerous and the worst of daemons to those who are <lb/>
            governed by her.</p>
          <p>V. Sulla now thought that his military reputation <lb/>
            entitled him to aspire to a political career, and accordingly <lb/>
            as soon as the campaign was ended he began to seek the <lb/>
            favour of the people, and became a candidate for the prætor­ <lb/>
            ship ; but he was disappointed in his expectations. He at­ <lb/>
            tributed his failure to the populace, for he says that they <lb/>
            knew he was a friend of Bocchus, and if he filled the office of <lb/>
            ædile before that of prætor, they expected to have brilliant <lb/>
            hunting exhibitions and fights of Libyan † wild beasts, <lb/>
            and that therefore they elected others to the prætorship, <lb/>
            with the view of forcing him to serve as ædile. But that <lb/>
            Sulla does not state the real cause of his failure appears <lb/>
            evident from what followed. In the next year he obtained <lb/>
            the prætorship, having gained the votes of the people, <lb/>
            partly by solicitation and partly by bribery. It was in <lb/>
            allusion to this, and during his prætorship when he was <note type="footnote">* The passage is in the Phœnissæ of Euripides, v. 531 &amp;c. : <lb/>

            wild animals, were brought from Africa to Rome for these occasions. <lb/>
            When Sulla was prætor B.O. 93, he exhibited one hundred lions in the <lb/>
            Circus, which were let loose and shot with arrows by archers whom <lb/>
            King Bocchus sent for the purpose. (Plinius, N. H. viii. 16 Soneca, <lb/>
            De Brevitate Vitæ, c. 13 ) There was an old decree of the Senate which <lb/>
            prohibited the importation of African wild beasts, but it was repealed <lb/>
            by a measure proposed by the tribune Cn. Aufidius so far as to render <lb/>

            This Mithridates is Mithradates the Sixth, king of Pontus in Asia, who <lb/>
            succeeded his father Mithridates V. B.C. 120, when he was about eleven <lb/>
            years of age. He was a man of ability, well instructed in the learning <lb/>
            of the Greeks, and a great linguist: it is said that he could speak <lb/>
            twenty-two languages. He had already got possession of Colchis on <lb/>
            the Black Sea, and placed one of his sons on the throne of Cappadocia. <lb/>
            He had also strengthened himself by marrying his daughter to Tigranes <lb/>

            two nations met; and this also may be considered as one <lb/>
            of the very fortunate events in Sulla's successful career, <lb/>
            that he was the first Roman to whom the Parthians ad­ <lb/>
            dressed themselves in their request for an alliance and <lb/>
            friendship with Rome. Sulla is said to have had three <lb/>
            chairs placed, one for Ariobarzanes, another for Orobazus, <lb/>
            and a third for himself, on which he took his seat between <lb/>
            the two, while the business was transacted. The king of <lb/>
            the Parthians is said to have put Orobazus to death for <lb/>
            submitting to this indignity ; as to Sulla, some commended <lb/>
            him for his haughty treatment of the barbarians, while <lb/>
            others blamed him for his arrogance and ill-timed pride. It <lb/>
            is said there was a man among the attendants of Orobazus, <lb/>
            a Chaldæan,* who examined the countenance of Sulla and <lb/>
            observed the movements of his mind and body, not as an <lb/>
            idle spectator, but studying his character according to the <lb/>
            principles of his art, and he declared that of necessity that <lb/>
            man must become the first of men, and he wondered that <lb/>
            he could endure not to be the first already. On his <lb/>
            return to Rome Censorinust instituted proceedings against <lb/>
            Sulla on the charge of having received large sums of <lb/>
            money, contrary to express law, from a king who was <lb/>
            a friend and ally of the Romans. Censorinus did not <lb/>

            Jugurtha being surrendered by himself to Sulla. Marius <lb/>
            was highly incensed and attempted to take the figures <lb/>
            down, while others were ready to support Sulla, and the <lb/>
            city was all but in a flame through the two factions, when <lb/>
            the Social War which had long smouldered burst forth in <lb/>
            a blaze upon Rome and stopped the civil discord. In this <lb/>
            most serious war, which was attended with many varia­ <lb/>
            tions of fortune, and brought on the Romans the greatest <lb/>
            misery and the most formidable dangers, Marius by his <lb/>
            inability to accomplish anything of importance showed <lb/>
            that military excellence requires bodily vigour and <lb/>
            strength: but Sulla by his great exploits obtained among <lb/>
            his own citizens the reputation of a great commander, <lb/>
            among his friends the reputation of the very greatest, and <lb/>
            among his enemies too the reputation of the most fortunate <lb/>
            of generals. Sulla did not behave like Timotheus* the son <lb/>
            of Konon, whose success was attributed by his enemies to <lb/>
            fortune, and they had paintings made in which he was <lb/>
            represented asleep while Fortune was throwing a net over <lb/>
            the cities, all which he took in a very boorish way, and <lb/>
            got into a passion with his enemies, as if they were thus <lb/>
            attempting to deprive him of the honour due to his <lb/>
            exploits; and on one occasion, returning from a successful <lb/>
            expedition, he said to the people, " Well, Fortune has had <lb/>
            no share in this campaign, at least, Athenians." Now, as <lb/>
            the story goes, Fortune † showed her spite to Timotheus <note type="footnote"> * Timotheus distinguished himself during the period of the decline <lb/>
            of the power of Athens. In the year B.O. 357 he and Jphicrates were <lb/>

            especially the island of Samoa. The expedition was unsuccessful, and <lb/>
            Timotheus and other generals were brought to trial on their return <lb/>
            home. Timotheus was convicted, and sentenced to pay a heavy fine, <lb/>
            but as he was unable to pay it, he withdrew to Chalkis in Eubœa, <lb/>
            where he died B.O. 354. (Penny Cyclopædia, art. Timotheus.") This <lb/>

            as the context shows. It is not very easy to unravel all the ancient <lb/>
            notions about Fortune, Nemesis, and the like personifications. The <lb/>
            opinion that the deity, or the dæmon, looks with an envious eye on a <lb/>
            man's prosperity and in the end pays him off with some equivalent loss, <lb/>
            is very common in the Greek writers. One instance of it occurs in the </note> <lb/>

            in return for his arrogance, and he never did anything <lb/>
            great afterwards, but failing in all his undertakings and <lb/>
            becoming odious to the people, he was at last banished <lb/>
            from the city. But Bulla by gladly accepting such <lb/>
            felicitations on his prosperity and such admiration, and <lb/>
            even contributing to strengthen these notions and to <lb/>
            invest them with somewhat of a sacred character, made <lb/>
            all his exploits depend on Fortune; whether it was that <lb/>
            he did this for the sake of display, or because he really <lb/>
            had such opinions of the deity. Indeed he has recorded <lb/>
            in his memoirs, that the actions which he resolved upon <lb/>
            without deliberation, and on the spur of the moment, <lb/>
            turned out more successfully than those which appeared <lb/>
            to have been best considered. And again, from the <lb/>
            passage in which he says that he was made more for <lb/>
            fortune than for war, he appears to attribute more to <lb/>
            fortune than to his merit, and to consider himself com­ <lb/>
            pletely as the creature of the daemon ;* nay, he cites as a <note type="footnote">letter of Amasis, the cunning King of Egypt, to Polykrates the tyrant <lb/>
            of Samos. (Herodotus, iii. 40.) The Egyp ian King tells Polykrates <lb/>
            plainly that his great good luck would certainly draw upon him some <lb/>
            heavy calamity, for “the dæmon (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ θει̑ον</foreign>) is envious; " and so it was, <lb/>
            for Polykrates died a wretched death. Timotheus, according to Plutarch, <lb/>
            provoked Fortune by his arrogance. </note><note type="footnote"> * This word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίμων</foreign>) often occurs in Plutarch. In order to under­ <lb/>
            stand it, we must first banish from our minds the modern notions <lb/>
            attached to the word Daemon. A little further, Sulla speaks of what <lb/>
            the dæmon (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δαιμόνιον</foreign>) enjoins during the night. People in ancient <lb/>
            times attached great importance to dreams, because they were COIl­ <lb/>
            sidered as a medium by which the gods communicated with men. <lb/>
            There is great difficulty in translating an ancient writer on account of <lb/>
            the terms used in speaking of superhuman powers. </note><note type="footnote"> Apuleius, who lived in the second century of our sera and was con­ <lb/>
            sequently nearly a contemporary of Plutarch, has explained this <lb/>
            doctrine of daemons in his treatise On the God of Sokrates. " Moreover <lb/>
            there are certain divine middle powers, situated in thisinterval between <lb/>
            the highest ether and earth, which is in the lowest place, through <lb/>
            whom our desires and deserts pass to the gods. These are called by a <lb/>
            Greek name daemons, who being placed between the terrestrial and celts­ <lb/>
            tial inhabitants, transmit prayers from the one and gifts from the other. <lb/>
            They likewise carry supplications from the one and auxiliaries from the <lb/>
            other as certain interpreters an d saluters of both. Through these same <lb/>
            demons, as Plato says in the Banquet, all denunciations, the various <lb/>

            prophets, or hurling thunder, or producing the coruscations of lightning <lb/>
            in the clouds, or causing other things to take place from which we <lb/>
            obtain a knowledge of future events. And it is requisite to think that <lb/>
            all these particulars are effected by the will, the power, and authority <lb/>
            of the celestial gods, but by the compliance, operations, and ministrant <lb/>
            offices of dæmons.”—T. Taylor's Translation: he adds, " For a cop ons <lb/>
            account of dæmons. their nature, and different orders, see the notes on <lb/>
            the First Alkibiades in vol. i. of my Plato, and also my translation of <lb/>
            lamblichus on the Mysteries.” A little further on Apulerus says: ., It <lb/>
            is not tit that the supernal gods should descend to things of this kind. <lb/>
            This is the province of the intermediate gods, who dwell in the regions <lb/>
            of the air, which border on the earth, and yet are no less conversant <lb/>
            with the confines of the heavens; just as in every part of the world <lb/>
            there are animals adapted to the several parts, the volant being in tho <lb/>
            air and the gradient on the earth." </note><note type="footnote"> As to the expression "the god" (6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεός</foreign>), which often occurs in <lb/>
            Greek writers, Taylor observes (note a ) “ According to Plato one <lb/>
            thing is a god simply, another on account of union, another through <lb/>
            participation, another through contact, and another through similitude. <lb/>
            For of super-essential natures, each is primarily a god ; of intellectual <lb/>
            natures, each is a god according to union; and of divine souls, each is <lb/>
            a god according to contact with the gods; and the souls of men are <lb/>
            allotted this appellation through similitude." He therefore concludes <lb/>
            that Apuleius was justified in calling the daemon of Sokrates a god; <lb/>
            and that this was the opinion of Sokrates appears, as he says, from the <lb/>
            First Alkibiades, where Sokrates says, “I have long been of opinion <lb/>
            that the god did not as yet direct me to hold any conversation with <lb/>
            you." </note><note type="footnote"> Apuleius further says,“ There is another species of daemons, more <lb/>
            sublime and venerable, not less numerous, but far superior in dignity, <lb/>
            who, being always liberated from the bonds and conjunction of the body, <lb/>
            preside over certain powers. In the number of these are Sleep and <lb/>
            Love, who possess powers of a different nature; Love, of exciting to <lb/>
            wakefulness, but Sleep of lulling to rest. From this more sublime <lb/>
            order of dæmons, Plato asserts that a peculiar dæmon is allotted to <lb/>
            every man who is a witness and a guardian of his conduct in life, who, <lb/>
            without being visible to any one, is always present, and who is an <lb/>
            arbitrator not only of his deeds, but also of his thoughts. But when, <lb/>
            life being finished, the soul returns [to the judges of its conduct], then <lb/>
            the dæmon who presided over it, immediately seizes and leads it as <lb/>
            his charge to judgment, and is there present with it while it pleads its <lb/>
            cause. There, this dæmon reprehends it, if it has acted on any false <lb/>
            pretence; solemnly confirms what it says, if it averts anothing that is <lb/>
            true; and conformably to its testimony passes sentence. All you </note> <lb/>

            with himself, and his father-in-law, for he expected that <lb/>
            Metellus would cause him a good deal of trouble, whereas <note type="footnote"> therefore who hear this divine opinion of Plato, as interpreted by me, <lb/>
            to form your minds to whatever von may do, or to whatever may be <lb/>
            the subject of your meditation, that you may know there is nothing <lb/>
            concealed from those guardians either within the mind or external to <lb/>
            it; but that the dæmon who presides over you inquisitively participates <lb/>
            of all that concerns you, sees all things, understands all things, and iu <lb/>
            the place of conscience dwells in the most profound recesses of the <lb/>
            mind. For he of whom I speak is a perfect guardian, a singular <lb/>
            prefect, a domestic speculator, a proper curator, an intimate inspector, <lb/>
            an assiduous observer, an inseparable arbiter, a reprohator of what is <lb/>
            evil, an approver of what is good; and if he is legitimately attended <lb/>
            to, sedulously known, anuI religiously worshipped, in the way in which <lb/>
            he was reverenced by Sokrates with justice and innocence, will be a <lb/>
            predictor of things uncertain, a premonitor in things dubious, a do. <lb/>
            fender in things dangerous, and an assistant in vant. He will also be <lb/>
            able, by dreams, by tokens, and perhaps also manifestly, when the <lb/>
            (ccasion demands it, to avert from you evil, increase your good, raise <lb/>
            your depressed, support your falling, illuminate your obscure, govern <lb/>
            your prosperous, and correct your adverse circumstances. It is not <lb/>
            therefore wonderful, if Sokrates, who was a man exceedingly perfect, <lb/>
            and also wise by the testimony of Apollo, should know and worship <lb/>
            this his god; and that hence, this his keeper, and nearly, as I may <lb/>
            say, his equal, his associate and domestic, should repel from him every­ <lb/>
            thing which ought to be repelled, foresee what ought to be noticed, <lb/>
            and pre-admonish him of what ought to be foreknown by him, in those <lb/>
            cases in which, human wisdom being no longer of any use, he was in <lb/>
            want not of counsel but of presage, in order that when he was vacil­ <lb/>
            lating through doubt, he might be rendered firm through divination. <lb/>
            For there are many things, concerning the development of which even <lb/>
            wise men betake themselves to diviners and oracles." I have adopted <lb/>
            Taylors translation of this eloquent passage, because he was well ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with the theological systems of antiquity. The whole passage <lb/>
            is a useful comment on this chapter of Plutarch and many other <lb/>
            passages in him, and may help to rectify some erroneous notions which <lb/>
            people maintain of the philosophical systems of antiquity, people who, <lb/>
            as Bishop Butler expresses it, “ take for granted that they are ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with everything." The passage about conscience contains, <lb/>
            as Taylor observes, a dogma which is only to be found implicitly main­ <lb/>
            tained in the Scholia of Olympiodorus on the First Alkibiades of Plato. <lb/>
            Olympiodorus says that we shall not err if we call “ the allotted dæmon <lb/>
            conscience;" on which subject he has some further remarks. This <lb/>
            doctrine of the bameness of conscience and the internal daemon seems <lb/>
            to be that of the Emperor Marcus Antoninus (ii. 13): “ It is sufficient <lb/>
            to attend only to the dæmon within us and to reverence it duly," and <lb/>
            he goes on to explain wherein this reverence consists. In another <lb/>
            passage (ii. 17) he says that philosophy consists "in keeping the </note> <lb/>

            be was a most accommodating colleague.. Further, in his <lb/>
            memoirs which he dedicated to Lucullus, he advises him <lb/>
            to think nothing so safe as what the dæmon enjoins <lb/>
            during the night. When he was leaving the city with <lb/>
            his troops for the Social War, as he tells us in his memoirs, <lb/>
            a great chasm opened in the earth near Laverna, † from <lb/>
            which a quantity of fire burst forth, and a bright Same <lb/>
            rose like a column to the skies. The diviners said that a <lb/>
            brave man, of an appearance different from and superior <lb/>
            to ordinary men, would obtain the command and relieve <lb/>
            the city from its present troubles. bulla says this man <note type="footnote"> dæmon within us free from violence and harm, superior to pleasures <lb/>
            and pains, doing nothing without a purpose, and yet without any false­ <lb/>
            hood or simulation, without caring whether another is doing so or not; <lb/>
            further, taking what happens and what is our lot as coming from too <lb/>
            same origin from which itself came; and finally, waiting for death <lb/>
            with a tranquil mind, as nothing else than the separation of the ele­ <lb/>
            ments of which every living being is composed. And if there is <lb/>
            nothing to fear in the element il parts constantly changing one into <lb/>
            another, why should a man have any apprehension about the change <lb/>
            and dissolution of the whole ? for it is according to Nature, and nothing <lb/>
            is bad that is according to Nature." Bishop Butler remarks (Preface <lb/>
            to his Sermons) : " The practical reason of insisting so much upon the <lb/>
            natural authority of the principle of reflection or conscience is, that <lb/>
            it seems in a great measure overlooked by many who are by no means <lb/>
            t he worst sort of men. It is th ought sufficient to abstain from gross <lb/>
            wickedness, and to be humane aid kind to such as happen to come in <lb/>
            their way. Whereas, in reality, the very constitution of our nature <lb/>
            requires, that we bring our whole conduct before this superior faculty ; <lb/>
            wait its determination ; enforce upon ourselves its authority; and make <lb/>
            it the business of our lives, as it is absolute ly the whole business of a <lb/>
            moral agent to conform ourselves to it. This is the true meaning of <lb/>
            that ancient precept, reverence thyself" </note><note type="footnote"> This note does not apply to any particular case, when daemons are <lb/>

            was himself, for the golden colour of his hair was a pecu­ <lb/>
            liarity in his personal appearance, and that he had no <lb/>
            diffidence about bearing testimony to his own merits after <lb/>
            so many illustrious exploits. So much as to his religious <lb/>
            opinions. As to the other parts of his character, he was <lb/>
            irregular and inconsistent: he would take away much, <lb/>
            and give more; he would confer honours without any <lb/>
            good reason, and do a grievous wrong with just as little <lb/>
            reason; he courted those whose assistance he wanted, and <lb/>
            behaved with arrogance to those who wanted his aid; so <lb/>
            that one could not tell whether he had naturally more <lb/>
            haughtiness or subserviency. For as to his inconsistency <lb/>
            in punishing, sometimes inflicting death for the slightest <lb/>
            matters, and at others quietly bearing the greatest wrongs, <lb/>
            his ready reconciliations with his deadly enemies, and <lb/>
            his prosecution of slight and trifling offences with death <lb/>
            and confiscation of property-all this may be explained <lb/>
            on the supposition that he was naturally of a violent and <lb/>
            vindictive temper, but sometimes moderated his passion <lb/>
            upon calculations of interest. During this Social War <lb/>
            his soldiers killed with sticks and stones a man of <lb/>
            Praetorian rank, who was his legatus, Albinus * by name, <lb/>
            an outrage which Sulla overlooked, and made no inquiry <lb/>
            about: he went so far as to say, with apparent serious­ <lb/>
            ness, that the soldiers would bestir themselves the more <lb/>
            in the war and make amends for their fault by their <lb/>
            courage. As to any blame that was imputed to him, he <lb/>
            cared not for it; but having already formed the design of <lb/>
            overthrowing the power of Marius and of getting himself <lb/>
            appointed to the command against Mithridates, as the <lb/>
            Social War was now considered at an end, he endeavoured <lb/>
            to ingratiate himself with his army. On coming to Rome <lb/>
            he was elected consul with Quintus Pompeius † for his <lb/>
            colleague, being now fifty years of age, and he formed a <note type="footnote"> * Apparently Aulus Postumius Albinus, who was consul with <lb/>

            distinguished matrimonial alliance with Cæcilia,* the <lb/>
            daughter of Metellus,t the chief Pontifex. This gave <lb/>
            occasion to the populace to assail him with satirical <lb/>
            songs; and many of the highest class were displeased at <lb/>
            the marriage, as if they did not think him worthy of such <lb/>
            a wife, whom they had judged to be worthy of the <lb/>
            consulship, as Titus Livius‡ remarks. Cæcilia was not <lb/>
            the only wife that Sulla had. When he was a very young <lb/>
            man he married Ilia, who bore him a daughter ; his second <lb/>
            wife was Aelia; and his third wife was Clœlia, whom lie <lb/>
            divorced on the ground of barrenness, yet in a manner <lb/>
            honourable to the lady, with an ample testimony to her <lb/>
            virtues and with presents. But as he married Metella a <lb/>
            few days after, it was believed that his alleged ground of <lb/>
            divorce was merely a pretext. However, he always paid <lb/>
            great respect to Metella, which induced the Romans, when <lb/>
            they wished to recall from exile the partisans of Marius, <lb/>
            and Sulla refused his assent, to apply to Metella to inter­ <lb/>
            cede for them. After the capture of Athens also, it was <lb/>
            supposed that he treated the citizens with more severity, <lb/>
            because they had cast aspersions upon Metella from their <lb/>
            walls. But of this hereafter.</p>
          <p>VII. Sulla looked on the consulship as only a small <lb/>
            matter compared with what he expected to attain : the <lb/>
            great object of his desires was the command in the war <lb/>
            against Mithridates. But he had a rival in Marius, who <lb/>
            was moved by an insane love of distinction and by ambi­ <lb/>
            tion, passions which never grow old in a man, for though <lb/>
            he was now unwieldy and had done no service in the late <lb/>
            campaigns by reason of his age, he still longed for the <note type="footnote"> * Cæcilia Metella was the fourth wife of Sulla. The other three are <lb/>

            command in a distant war beyond the seas. While Bulla <lb/>
            was with the army completing some matters that still <lb/>
            remained to be finished, Marius kept at home and hatched <lb/>
            that most pestilent faction which did more mischief to <lb/>
            Rome than all her wars; and indeed the deity * showed <lb/>
            by signs what was coming. Fire spontaneously blazed <lb/>
            from the wooden shafts which supported the military <lb/>
            standards, and was quenched with difficulty; and three <lb/>
            crows brought their young into the public road, and aftei <lb/>
            devouring them, carried the fragments back to their nest. <lb/>
            The mice in a temple gnawed the gold which was kept <lb/>
            there, and the keeper of the temple caught one of the <lb/>
            mice, a female, in a trap, which produced in the trap five <lb/>
            young ones, and devoured three of them. But what was <lb/>
            chief of all, from a cloudless and clear sky there came the <lb/>
            sound of a trumpet, so shrill and mournful, that by reason <lb/>
            of the greatness thereof men were beside themselves and <lb/>
            crouched for fear. The Tusoan seers interpreted this to <lb/>
            portend the commencement of a new period, and a general <lb/>
            change. They say that there are in all eight periods, which <lb/>
            differ in mode of life and habits altogether from one <lb/>
            another, and to each period is assigned by the deity a cer­ <lb/>
            tain number of years determined by the revolution of a great <lb/>
            year. When a period is completed, the commencement of <lb/>
            another is indicated by some wondrous sign on the earth <lb/>
            or from the heavens, so as to make it immediately evident <lb/>
            to those who attend to such matters and have studied <lb/>
            them, that men are now adopting other habits and modes <lb/>
            of life, and are less or more an object of care to the gods <lb/>
            than the men of former periods. They say, in the change <lb/>
            from one period to another there are great alterations, and <lb/>
            that the art of the seer at one time is held in high repute, <lb/>
            and is successful in its predictions, when the deity gives <lb/>
            clear and manifest signs, but that in the course of another <lb/>
            period the art falls into a low condition, being for the <lb/>
            most part conjectural, and attempting to know the future <lb/>
            by equivocal and misty signs. Now this is what the Tuscan <lb/>
            wise men said, who are supposed to know more of such <note type="footnote"> * This word occurs three times in this chapter. In the first instance, <lb/>

            municating on these omens with the seers, in the temple <lb/>
            of Bellona,* a sparrow flew in before the whole body <lb/>
            with a grasshopper in his mouth, part of which he <lb/>
            dropped, and the rest he carried off with him out of the <lb/>
            place. From this the interpreters of omens apprehended <lb/>
            faction and divisions between the landholders on the <lb/>
            one side and the city folk and the merchant class on <lb/>
            the other, for the latter were loud and noisy like a <lb/>
            grasshopper, but the owners of land kept quiet on their <lb/>

            Sulpicius,t a man without rival in any kind of villainy, <lb/>
            and so one need not inquire whom he surpassed in wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, but only wherein he surpassed himself. For in <lb/>
            him were combined cruelty, audacity, and rapaciousness, <lb/>
            without any consideration of shame or of any crime, <lb/>
            inasmuch as he sold the Roman citizenship to libertini‡ <lb/>
            and resident aliens, and publicly received the money at a <lb/>
            table in the Forum. He maintained three thousand men <lb/>
            armed with daggers, and also a number of young men of <lb/>
            the equestrian class always about him, and ready for <lb/>
            anything, whom he called the Opposition Senate. He <lb/>
            caused a law to be passed that no Senator should contract <lb/>
            debt § to the amount of more than two thousand drachmae, <lb/>
            and yet at his death he left behind him a debt § of three <lb/>
            millions. This man being let loose upon the people by <lb/>
            Marius, and putting everything into a state of confusion <lb/>
            by violence and force of arms, framed various pernicious <lb/>
            laws, and among them that which gave to Marius the <lb/>
            command in the Mithridatic war. The consuls accordingly <note type="footnote"> * The Senate often met in the temple of Duellona or Bellona, the <lb/>

            declared a cessation* of all public business; but while <lb/>
            they were holding a meeting of the people near the temple <lb/>
            of Castor and Pollux, Sulpicius with his rabble attacked <lb/>
            them, and among many others massacred the youthful son <lb/>
            of Pompeius in the Forum; Pompeius only escaped by <lb/>
            hiding himself. Sulla was pursued into the house of <lb/>
            Marius, from which he was compelled to come out and <lb/>
            repeal the edict for the cessation of public business; and <lb/>
            it was for this reason that Sulpicius, though he de­ <lb/>
            prived Pompeius of his office, did not take the consul­ <lb/>
            ship from Sulla, but, merely transferred the command of <lb/>
            the Mithridatic war to Marius, and sent some tribunes <lb/>
            forthwith to Nola to take the army and lead it to Marius.</p>
          <p>IX. But Bulla made his escape to the camp before the <lb/>
            tribunes arrived, and the soldiers hearing of what had <lb/>
            passed, stoned them to death; upon which the partisans <lb/>
            of Marius murdered the friends of Sulla who were in the <lb/>
            city, and seized their property. This caused many persons <lb/>
            to betake themselves to flight, some going to the city from <lb/>
            the camp, and others from the camp to the city. The Senate <lb/>
            was not its own master, but was compelled to obey the <lb/>
            orders of Marius and Sulpicius; and on hearing that Bulla <lb/>
            was marching upon Rome, they sent to him two of the <lb/>
            prætors, Brutus and Servilius, to forbid him to advance <lb/>
            any further. The prætors, who assumed a bold tone <lb/>
            before Sulla, narrowly escaped being murdered ; as it was, <lb/>
            the soldiers broke their fasces, stripped them of their <lb/>
            senatorial dress, and sent them back with every insult. It <lb/>
            caused dejection in the city to see the praetors return without <lb/>
            their insignia of office, and to hear them report that the <lb/>
            commotion could not be checked, and was past all remedy. <lb/>
            Now the partisans of Marius were making their prepara­ <lb/>
            tions, while Bulla with his colleague and six complete <lb/>
            legions was moving from Nola; he saw that the army <lb/>
            was ready to march right to the city, but he had some <lb/>
            hesitation himself, and feared the risk.†However upon <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch here uses the same word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπράξιαι</foreign>) which I have else­ <lb/>

            Bulla making a sacrifice, the seer Postumius, after in­ <lb/>
            specting the signs, stretched out his hands to Sulla and <lb/>
            urged him to put him in chains and keep him a prisoner <lb/>
            till the battle took place, declaring that if everything <lb/>
            did Dot speedily turn out well, he was ready to be put to <lb/>
            death. It is said also that Sulla in his sleep had a vision <lb/>
            of the goddess, whose worship the Romans had learned <lb/>
            from the Cappadocians, whatever her name maybe, Selene,* <lb/>
            Athena, or Enyo. Sulla dreamed that the goddess stood <lb/>
            by him and put a thunderbolt into his hand, and as she <lb/>
            named each of his enemies bade him dart the bolt at them, <lb/>
            which he did; and his enemies were struck to the ground <lb/>
            and destroyed. Being encouraged by the dream, which <lb/>
            he communicated to his colleague, at daybreak Sulla led <lb/>
            his forces against Rome. When he was near Picinæ t <lb/>
            he was met by a deputation which entreated him not to <lb/>
            march forthwith against the city, for all justice would be <lb/>
            done pursuant to a resolution of the Senate. Sulla con­ <lb/>
            sented to encamp there, and ordered the officers to measure <lb/>
            out the ground for the encampment, according to the <lb/>
            usual practice, and the deputation went away trusting to <lb/>
            his promise. But as soon as they were gone, Sulla sent <lb/>
            Lucius Bacillus and Caius Mummius, who seized the gate <lb/>
            and that part of the walls which surrounds the Esquiline <lb/>
            hill, and Sulla set out to join them with all speed. <lb/>
            Bacillus and his soldiers broke into the city and attempted <lb/>
            to gain possession of it, but the people in large numbers, <lb/>
            being unarmed, mounted the house-tops, and by pelting <lb/>
            the soldiers with tiles and stones stopped their further <lb/>
            progress, and drove them back to the wall. In the <lb/>
            mean time Sulla had come up, and seeing how matters <lb/>

            consideration, giving way to passion, and surrendering <lb/>

            before him only his enemies, and without thought or pity <lb/>
            for his friends and kinsmen, would force his way into <lb/>
            Rome with the help of flames, which know no distinction <lb/>
            between the guilty and the innocent. While this was <lb/>
            going on, Marius, who had been driven as far as the <lb/>
            temple of Earth,. invited the slaves to join him by offer­ <lb/>
            ing them their freedom, but being overpowered by his <lb/>
            enemies who pressed on him, he left the city.</p>
          <p>X. Sulla assembled the Senate, who condemned t to <lb/>
            death Marius and a few others, among whom was the <lb/>
            tribune Sulpicius. Sulpicius was put to death, being <lb/>
            betrayed by a slave, to whom Sulla gave his freedom, and <lb/>
            then ordered him to be thrown down the Tarpeian rock : <lb/>
            he set a price on the head of Marius, which was neither a <lb/>
            generous nor a politic measure, as Marius had shortly <lb/>
            before let Sulla off safe when Sulla put himself into his <lb/>
            power by going to the house of Marius. Now if Marius <lb/>
            had not let Sulla go, but had given him up to Sulpicius <lb/>
            to be put to death, he might have secured the supreme <lb/>
            power; but he spared Bulla; and yet a few days after, <lb/>
            when Sulla had the same opportunity, Marius did not <lb/>
            obtain from him a like return. The conduct of Sulla <lb/>
            offended the Senate, though they durst not show it; but <lb/>
            the dislike of the people and their dissatisfaction were <lb/>
            made apparent to him by their acts. They contemp­ <lb/>
            tuously rejected Nonius, the son of Sulla's sister, and <lb/>
            Servius, who were candidates for offices, and elected those <lb/>
            whose elevation they thought would be most disagreeable <lb/>
            to Sulla. But Bulla pretended to be pleased at this, and <lb/>
            to view it as a proof that the people, by doing what they <lb/>
            liked, were really indebted to him for their liberty; and <lb/>

            the opposite faction, to the consulship, having first bound <lb/>
            him by solemn imprecations and oaths to favour his <lb/>
            measures. Cinna ascended the Capitol with a stone in <lb/>

            received the consulship, he attempted to disturb the <lb/>
            present settlement of a Hairs, and prepared to institute a <lb/>

            conducting his armament from Italy, many omens occurred <lb/>
            to Mithridates, who was staying in Pergamum, and that a <lb/>
            Victory, bearing a crown, which the people of Pergamum <lb/>
            were letting down upon him by some machinery from <lb/>
            above, was broken in pieces just as it was touching his <lb/>
            head, and the crown falling upon the theatre, came to the <lb/>
            ground and was destroyed, which made the spectators <lb/>
            shudder and greatly dispirited Mithridates, though his <lb/>
            affairs were then going on favourably beyond all expecta­ <lb/>
            tion. For he had taken Asia‡ from the Romans, and <note type="footnote"> * L. Cornel ius Cinna and On. Octavius were consuls B.O. 87, the <lb/>

            (On the God of Sokrates) thus alludes to the kind of oath which Cinna <lb/>
            took—“ Shall I swear by Jupiter, holding a stone in my hand, after <lb/>
            the most ancient manner of the Romans ? But if the opinion of Plato <lb/>
            is true, that God never mingles himself with man, a stone will hear <lb/>
            me more easily than Jupiter. This however is not true: for Plato <lb/>
            will answer for his opinion by my voice. I do not, says he, assert that <lb/>
            the gods are separated and alienated from us, so as to think that not <lb/>

            the Straits of Kaffa or Yenikalé, which unites the Black Sea and the <lb/>
            Mæotis or Sea of Azoff. B osporus was also a name of Pantikapaum, one <lb/>
            of the chief towns of the Bosporus. There was a series of Greek kings <lb/>
            of the Bosporus, extending from B.C. 430 to B.C. 304, whose names are <lb/>
            known; and there may have been others. In the time of Demosthenes, <lb/>
            in the fourth century before the Christian æra, the Athenians imported <lb/>
            annually a largo quantity of corn from the Bosporus. This was the <lb/>

            Aciarathes, whom he makes to be the fame as the Arcathias of Appian <lb/>
            (c. 35). Ariarathes however was a son of Mithridates (Mithridatic War, <lb/>
            15); and according to Appian, it was a son Mithridates who held <lb/>

            sustained a slight check near Chæroneia. For there he <lb/>
            was met by Bruttius Sura,* a legatus of Sentius, prætor <lb/>
            of Macedonia, and a man of signal courage and prudence. <lb/>
            Archelaus was sweeping through Boeotia like a torrent, <lb/>
            when he was vigorously opposed by Sura, who, after <lb/>
            fighting three battles near Chæroneia, repulsed him and <lb/>
            drove him back to the coast. On receiving orders from <lb/>
            Lucius Lucullus † to make room for Sulla, who was <lb/>
            coming, and to allow him to carry on the war, for which <lb/>

            sent deputations to Sulla and invited him to enter; but <lb/>

            hanged the slaves that he found there, and cut off the hands of the <lb/>

            began with his being sent by the Athenians on an embassy to Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, and he ultimately persuaded the Athenians to join the king. <lb/>
            This is the account of Posidonius as quoted by Athenæus (v. 211, &amp;c. <lb/>
            ed. Casaub.) Appian (Mithridatic War, 28, &amp;c.) gives an account of his <lb/>
            making himselt a tyrant in Athens, which is somewhat different. He <lb/>
            appears to have established himself in B.O. 88; and his power only lasted <lb/>
            till B.C. 86. This Aristion was a philosopher, which gives occasion to <lb/>
            some curious remarks by Appian (Mithridatic War, c. 28), who says, <lb/>
            speaking of his enormities: “ and all this he did though he was a follower <lb/>

            employing every variety of engine and every mode of <lb/>
            attack. If he had waited a short time, he might have <lb/>
            taken the Upper City without danger, for through want <lb/>
            of provisions it was reduced by famine to extreme <lb/>
            necessity; but anxious to return to Rome, and fearing a <lb/>
            new revolution there, at great risk fighting many battles <lb/>
            and at great cost he urged on the war, wherein, besides <lb/>
            the rest of the expenditure, the labour about the military <lb/>
            engines required ten thousand pair of mules to be daily <lb/>
            employed on this service. As wood began to fail, owing <lb/>
            to many of the works being destroyed by their own <lb/>
            weight, and burnt by the incessant fires thrown by the <lb/>
            enemy, Sulla laid his hands on the several groves and <lb/>
            levelled the trees in the Academia,† which was the best <lb/>
            wooded of the suburbs, and those in the Lycæum. And <lb/>
            as he wanted money also for the war, he violated the <lb/>
            sacred depositaries of Greece, sending for the finest and <lb/>
            most costly of the offerings dedicated in Epidaurus ‡and <note type="footnote"> and tyrants more cruel than tyrants who were not philosophers. So <lb/>
            that one may doubt as to other philosophers, and have some suspicion, <lb/>
            whether it was for virtue's sake,or merely to console them for their <lb/>
            poverty and having nothing to do with political matters, that they <lb/>
            adopted philosophy. There are now many philosophers in a private <lb/>
            station and poor who consequently wrap themselves up in philosophy <lb/>
            out of necessity, and bitterly abuse those who are rich or in power; <lb/>
            and thereby do not so much get a reputation for despising wealth and <lb/>
            power as being envious of them. But those whom they abuse act <lb/>
            much more wisely in despising them." There was at least one ex­ <lb/>
            ception to these philosophers, Marcus Antoninus, who was the head <lb/>
            of the Roman State, and required in his exalted station all the comfort <lb/>

            ages. This and other temples were also used as places of deposit for <lb/>
            the preservation of valuable property. Pausanias (v. 21, vi. 19, and <lb/>
            in other passages) has spoken at great length of the treasures of <lb/>
            Olympia. These rich deposits were a tempting booty to those who <lb/>
            were in want of money and were strong enough to seize it. At the <lb/>
            commencement of the Peloponnesian war (B.O. 431) it was proposed <lb/>
            that the Peloponnesian allies should raise a fleet by borrowing money <lb/>
            from the deposits at Olympia and Delphi (Thucydides, i. 121), a <lb/>
            scheme which the Athenians, their enemies, appear to have looked <lb/>
            upon as a mode of borrowing of which repayment would form no part. <lb/>

            very minute matters. The rich stores of the Holy House of the Virgin <lb/>

            part of the valuable things-, at Delphi for the purpose of paying their <lb/>
            troops. (Diodorus, xvi. 30.) </note> <lb/>

            he bade him take courage and seize the property, as the <lb/>
            deity was quite willing, and in fact offered it. Now all <lb/>
            the things were secretly sent off unobserved by most of <lb/>
            the Greeks; but the silver jar, one of the royal presents <lb/>
            which still remained, could not be carried away by the <lb/>
            beasts of burden owing to its weight and size, and the <lb/>
            Amphiktyons were accordingly obliged to cut it in pieces; <lb/>
            and this led them to reflect that Titus Flamininus,* and <lb/>
            Manius Acilius, and also Æmilius Paulus—Acilius, who <lb/>
            drove Antiochus out of Greece; and the two others, who <lb/>
            totally defeated the kings of Macedonia—not only re­ <lb/>
            frained from touching the Greek temples, but even gave <lb/>
            them presents and showed them great honour and respect. <lb/>
            These generals, however, were legally appointed to com­ <lb/>
            mand troops consisting of well-disciplined soldiers, who <lb/>
            had been taught to obey their leaders without a murmur: <lb/>
            and the commanders themselves were men of kingly souls, <lb/>
            and moderate in their living and satisfied with a small <lb/>
            fixed expenditure, and they thought it baser to attempt <lb/>
            to win the soldiers' favour than to fear their enemies. <lb/>
            But the generals at this time, as they acquired their rank <lb/>
            by violence and not by merit, and had more occasion to <lb/>
            employ arms against one another than against the enemies <lb/>
            of Rome, were compelled to act the demagogue while <lb/>
            they were in command; and by purchasing the services <lb/>
            of the soldiers by the money which they expended to <lb/>
            gratify them, they made the Roman state a thing for <lb/>
            bargain and sale, and themselves the slaves of the vilest <lb/>
            wretches in order that they might domineer over honest <lb/>
            men. This is what drove Marius into exile, and then <lb/>
            brought him back to oppose Sulla; this made Cinna the <lb/>

            Flaccus. And Sulla mainly laid the foundation of all <lb/>
            this by his profusion and expenditure upon his own <lb/>
            soldiers, the object of which was to corrupt and gain over <lb/>
            to his side the soldiers of other commanders; so that his <lb/>
            attempts to seduce the troops of others and the extra­ <lb/>
            vagance by which his own soldiers were corrupted, made <lb/>
            money always necessary to him; and most particularly <lb/>
            during the siege of Athens.</p>
          <p>XIII. Now Sulla was seized with a violent and irre­ <lb/>
            sistible desire to take Athens, whether it was that he was <lb/>
            ambitious to contend against a city which retained only <lb/>
            the shadow of its former glory, or that he was moved by <lb/>
            passion to revenge the scoffs and jeers with which the <lb/>
            tyrant Aristion irritated him and his wife Metella, by <lb/>
            continually taunting them from the wall and insulting <lb/>
            them. This Aristion was a compound of lewdness and <lb/>
            cruelty, who combined in himself all the worst of the <lb/>
            vices and passions of Mithridates, and now had brought <lb/>
            as it were a mortal disease in its last extremities upon a <lb/>
            city which had come safe out of so many wars and escaped <lb/>
            from so many tyrannies and civil commotions. For now <lb/>
            when a medimnus* of wheat was selling for a thousand <lb/>
            drachmae in the Upper City, and men were obliged to oat <lb/>
            the parthenium t that grew about the Acropolis, and shoes <lb/>
            and oil-flasks, he was drinking all day long and amusing <lb/>
            himself with revels and pyrrhic dances, and making jokes <lb/>
            at the enemy: he let the sacred light of the goddess go <lb/>
            out for want of oil; when the hierophant sent to ask for <lb/>
            the twelfth part of a medimnus of wheat, he sent her as <lb/>
            much pepper; and when the members of the Senate and <lb/>
            the priests entreated him to have pity on the city and <note type="footnote"> * The Medimnus was a dry measure, reckoned at 11 gallons 71456 <lb/>

            come to terms with Bulla, he dispersed them by ordering <lb/>
            the archers to fire on them. At last being persuaded with <lb/>
            great difficulty, he sent two or three of his boon com­ <lb/>

            wars, on which Sulla said, “ Be gone, my good fellows, <lb/>
            with your fine talk. I was not sent to Athens by the <lb/>
            Romans to learn a lesson, but to compel rebels to submit."</p>
          <p>XIV. In the mean time, as the story goes, some soldiers <lb/>
            in the Keramicus* overheard certain old men talking to <lb/>
            one another, and abusing the tyrant for not guarding the <lb/>
            approach to the wall about the Heptachalkum, which was <lb/>
            the only part, they said, where it was practicable and easy <lb/>
            for the enemy to get over ; and the soldiers reported to <lb/>
            Sulla what they heard. Sulla did not neglect the in­ <lb/>
            telligence, but he went to the spot by night, and seeing <lb/>
            that it was practicable, he set about the thing forthwith. <lb/>
            He says in his Memoirs that the first man who mounted the <lb/>
            wall was Marcus Teius,† who, finding a soldier in his way, <lb/>
            struck him a violent blow on the helmet, which broke his <lb/>
            sword ; still Marcus did not retreat, but kept his ground. <lb/>
            The city then was taken from this quarter, as the old <lb/>
            Athenians said it might be. Sulla having destroyed and <lb/>
            levelled that part of the wall which lies between the <lb/>
            Peiræic and the Sacred‡ Gate, about midnight entered the <lb/>
            city, striking terror with the sound of trumpets and horns, <lb/>
            and the shouts and cries of the soldiers, who had his <lb/>
            full licence to plunder and kill, and made their way <lb/>
            through the streets with naked swords. The slain were not <lb/>
            counted, but the number is even now measured by the <note type="footnote"> * For all matters relating to the topography of Rome and Athens, <lb/>

            The gate called Dipylum or Double-Gate was the passage from the <lb/>

            space over which the blood flowed. For besides those <lb/>
            who were slaughtered in the other parts of the city, the <lb/>
            blood of those who fell about the Agora* covered all the <lb/>
            Keramicus within Dipylum : many say that it even flowed <lb/>
            through the gates and deluged the suburbs. But though <lb/>
            the number of those who perished by the sword was so <lb/>
            great, as many killed themselves for sorrow and regret at <lb/>
            the overthrow of their native city. For all the most honest <lb/>
            citizens were driven to despair, expecting in Bulla neither <lb/>
            humanity nor moderation. But, however, when Meidias <lb/>
            and Kalliphon, who were exiles, fell down at his knees <lb/>
            with entreaties, and the Senators who were in his army <lb/>
            urged him to save the city, being now sated with ven­ <lb/>
            geance and passing some encomiums upon the ancient <lb/>
            Athenians, he said he would pardon the many for the <lb/>
            sake of the few, and the living for the sake of the dead. <lb/>
            Sulla states in his Memoirs, that he took Athens on the <lb/>
            Calends of March,† which day nearly coincides with the <lb/>
            new moon of Anthesterion, in which month it happens <lb/>
            that the Athenians perform many ceremonies in com­ <lb/>
            memoration of the great damage and loss occasioned by <lb/>
            the heavy rain, for they suppose that the deluge happened <lb/>
            pretty nearly about that time. When the city was taken <lb/>
            the tyrant retreated to the Acropolis, where he was <lb/>
            besieged by Curio, who was commissioned for this purpose : <lb/>
            after he had held out for some time, Aristion was com­ <lb/>
            pelled to surrender for want of water; his surrender <lb/>
            was immediately followed by a token from the deity, for <lb/>
            on the very day and hour on which Curio took the tyrant <lb/>
            from the Acropolis, the clouds gathered in the clear sky, <lb/>
            and a violent shower descended which filled the Acropolis <lb/>
            with water. Sulla soon took the Peiræus also, and burnt <note type="footnote"> * A Greek A gora corresponds to a Roman Forum. </note><note type="footnote"> t The description of the capture of Athens is given by Appian. <lb/>

            Mithridates, coming down from Thrace and Macedonia <lb/>
            with one hundred thousand foot, ten thousand horse, <lb/>
            and ninety scythe-bearing four-horse chariots, summoned <lb/>
            Archelaus, who was still lying with his ships near <lb/>
            Munychia,t and was neither inclined to give up the sea <lb/>
            nor ready to engage with the Romans: his plan was to <lb/>
            protract the war and to cut off the supplies of the enemy. <lb/>
            But Sulla was as quick as Archelaus, and moved into <lb/>
            Boeotia from a niggardly region, which even in time of <lb/>
            peace could not have maintained his troops. Most people <lb/>
            thought that he had made a false calculation in leaving <lb/>
            Attica, which is a rough country and ill adapted for the <lb/>
            movements of cavalry, to throw himself into the cham­ <lb/>
            paign and open tracts of Bœotia, when he knew that the <lb/>
            strength of the barbarians lay in their chariots and cavalry. <lb/>
            But in his flight from famine and scarcity, as I have <lb/>
            already observed, he was compelled to seek the hazard of <lb/>
            a battle. Besides, he was alarmed for Hortensius,‡ a <lb/>
            skilful general and a man ambitious of distinction, who <note type="footnote"> * See Strabo, p. 395. </note><note type="footnote"> t One of the ports of the maritime town of Athens. The events <lb/>

            he probably took some other line, and he was conducted by Kaphis <lb/>
            over the heights of the great mountain mass of Parnassus. Kaphis <lb/>
            appears to be the person of the same name who had been mentioned <lb/>
            before (c. 12), though he is there called a Phokian. In this chapter <lb/>
            Plutarch calls him a Chæroneian. Tithora or Tithorea was in the <lb/>
            time of Herodotus (viii. 32) the name of that summit of Parnassus to <lb/>
            which the Phokians of the neighbouring town of Neon fled from the <lb/>
            soldiers of Xerxes B.C. 480. Pausanias (x. 32) remarks that the city <lb/>
            Neon must have taken the name of Tithorea after the time of Hero. <lb/>

            speaks was the place to which the Phokians fled; and therefore Neon, <lb/>
            the place from which they fled, cannot be Tithora, according to <lb/>
            Plutarch; and the description of Tithorea by Herodotus, though very <lb/>
            brief, agrees with the description of Plutarch. Pausanias places <lb/>

            was conducting a force from Thessaly to Sulla, and had to <lb/>
            pass through the straits where the enemy was waiting <lb/>
            for him. For all these reasons Sulla moved into Boeotia. <lb/>
            But Kaphis, who was from my town, evading the bar­ <lb/>
            barians by taking a different route from what they <lb/>
            expected, led Hortensius over Parnassus, close by Tithora, <lb/>
            which was not at that time so large a city as it is now, <lb/>
            but only a fort on a steep rock scarped all round, to <lb/>
            which place in time of old the Phokians who fled from <lb/>
            Xerxes escaped with their property and were there in <lb/>
            safety. Hortensius having encamped there during the <lb/>
            day repelled the attacks of the enemy, and at night <lb/>
            descending to Patronis, through a difficult path joined <lb/>
            Bulla, who met him with his forces.</p>
          <p>XVI. Having united their forces, Sulla and Hortensius <lb/>
            occupied an elevation rising out of the midst of the plains <lb/>
            of Elateia,* which was fertile and extensive, and had <lb/>
            water at its base : it is called Philobœotus, and its natural <lb/>
            qualities and position are most highly commended by <lb/>
            Sulla. When they were encamped, the weakness of the <lb/>
            Roman force was apparent to the enemy; for the cavalry <lb/>
            did not exceed fifteen hundred, and the infantry was below <lb/>
            fifteen thousand. Accordingly the rest of the generals, <lb/>
            against the wish of Archelaus, drew out their forces in <lb/>
            order of battle, and filled the plain with horses, chariots, <lb/>
            shields, and bucklers ; and the heavens could not contain <lb/>
            the shouts and cries of so many nations putting them­ <lb/>
            selves in battle array. At the same time the pomp and <lb/>
            costly splendour of the troops were not without effect nor <lb/>
            their use in causing alarm; but the glittering of the <lb/>
            arms, which were curiously ornamented with gold and <lb/>
            silver, and the colour of the Median and Scythian dresses <lb/>
            mingled with the brightness of the brass and steel, pro­ <note type="footnote"> * Elateia was an important position in Phokis and near the river <lb/>

            the mountainous country to the north-west. The Kephisus takes a <lb/>

            moved like waves and changed their places, so that tho <lb/>

            and ridicule of the barbarians. But this turned out most <lb/>
            favourable to the Romans; for the enemy despising them, <lb/>
            neglected to preserve discipline, and indeed, owing to the <lb/>
            number of commanders, the army was not generally <lb/>
            inclined to obey orders; a few kept to their post within <lb/>
            their ramparts, but the greater part, tempted by the hope <lb/>
            of booty and plunder, were dispersed many days' journey <lb/>
            from the camp. It is said that they destroyed the city <lb/>
            of Panopeus, and plundered Lebadeia, and robbed the <lb/>
            oracular shrine without any order from a general. Sulla, <lb/>
            who could not endure to see the cities destroyed before his <lb/>
            eyes and was greatly irritated, no longer allowed his <lb/>

            he compelled them to divert the stream from its course <lb/>
            and to dig ditches, allowing no man any cessation and <lb/>
            punishing most severely all who gave in, his object being <lb/>
            to tire his soldiers with labour and to induce them to seek <lb/>
            danger as a release from it. And it happened as he <lb/>
            wished. For on the third day of this labour, as Sulla <lb/>
            was passing by, they entreated him with loud shouts to <lb/>
            lead them against the enemy. He replied, that they said <lb/>
            this not because they wished to fight, but because they <lb/>
            disliked labour; but if they really were disposed to fight, <lb/>
            he bade them move forthwith with their arms to yonder <lb/>
            place, pointing cut to them what was formerly the <lb/>
            Acropolis of the Parapotamii,* but the city was then <lb/>
            destroyed and there remained only a rocky precipitous <lb/>
            hill, separated from Mount Hedylium by the space <lb/>
            occupied by the river Assus, which falling into the <lb/>

            a more rapid stream, makes the Acropolis a safe place for <lb/>
            encampment. Bulla also wished to seize the height, as <lb/>
            he saw the Chalkaspides * of the enemy pressing on <lb/>
            towards it, and as his soldiers exerted themselves <lb/>
            vigorously, he succeeded in occupying the place. Arch a- <lb/>
            laus, being repelled from this point, advanced towards <lb/>
            Chæroneia, upon which the men of Chæroneia who were <lb/>
            in Sulla's army entreating him not to let their city fall <lb/>
            into the hands of the enemy, he sent Gabinius,† a tribune, <lb/>
            with one legion, and permitted the men of Chæroneia to <lb/>
            go also, who, though they had the best intention, could <lb/>
            not reach the place before Gabinius: so brave a man he <lb/>
            was, and more active in bringing aid than even those <lb/>
            who prayed for it. Juba ‡ says it was not Gabinius who <lb/>
            was sent, but Ericius. However this may be, our city § <lb/>

          <p>XVII. From Lebadeia || and the oracle of Trophonius <lb/>
            favourable omens and predictions of victory were sent to <lb/>
            the Romans, about which the people of the country have <lb/>
            a good deal to say. But Sulla, in the tenth book of his <lb/>
            Memoirs, writes, that Quintus Titius, a man of some note <lb/>
            among those who had mercantile affairs in Greece, came <lb/>
            to him immediately after the victory in Chæroneia, to <lb/>
            report that Trophonius foretold a second battle and <lb/>
            victory there in a short time. After Titius, a soldier in his <lb/>
            army, named Salvenius, brought an answer from the god, <lb/>
            as to what would be the result of affairs in Italy. Both <lb/>
            reported the same as to the vision ¶ of the god: they said, <note type="footnote"> * The soldiers who had shields of brass. </note><note type="footnote"> t This was Aulus Gabinius, who was sent by Bulla B.O. 81 with <lb/>
            orders to L. Licinius Murena to put an end to the war with Mithridates. <lb/>

            that in beauty and stature he was like the Olympian <lb/>
            Jupiter. After crossing the Assus and advancing to the <lb/>
            foot of Hedylium, Sulla encamped near Archelaus, who <lb/>
            bad thrown up a strong intrenchment between Mounts <lb/>
            Akontium and Hedylium, at a place called the Assia. <lb/>
            The spot on which he encamped is called Archelaus from <lb/>
            his name up to the present day. After the interval of <lb/>
            one day Bulla left Murena * with one legion and two <lb/>
            cohorts, to annoy the enemy if he should attempt to form <lb/>
            in order of battle ; he himself sacrificed on the banks of the <lb/>
            Kephisus, and the victims being favourable, he advanced <lb/>
            towards Chæroneia with the object of again effecting a <lb/>
            junction with the forces there, and examining the place <lb/>
            called Thurium, which was occupied by the enemy. This <lb/>
            is a rough summit and a conical-shaped hill, named <lb/>
            Orthopagus; and under it is the stream of the Morius <lb/>
            and a temple of the Thurian Apollo. The deity has this <lb/>
            name from Thuro, the mother of Chæron, who is said to <lb/>
            have been the founder of Chæroneia. Some say that the <lb/>
            cow which was given by the Pythian Apollo as a guide to <lb/>
            Kadmus,† appeared there, and that the place was so called <lb/>
            from her ; for the Phœnicians call the cow Thor. As Bulla <lb/>
            was approaching Chaeroneia, the tribune who was stationed <lb/>
            in the city led out the soldiers under arms, and met him <lb/>
            with a chaplet of bay. No sooner had Sulla received the <lb/>
            chaplet, and after saluting the soldiers, encouraged them to <lb/>
            the approaching battle, than two Chæroneians (Homoloichus <lb/>
            and Anaxidamos) presented themselves to him and under­ <lb/>
            took to drive the enemy from Thurium if he would give <lb/>
            them a few soldiers. They said there was a path unknown <lb/>
            to the barbarians, leading from the place called Petrachus by <lb/>
            the Museum ‡ to the highest point of Thurium, and that by <lb/>
            taking this direction they could, without difficulty, fall on <lb/>
            the enemy and either roll stones down upon them from above <lb/>
            or drive them into the plain. As Gabinius bore testimony <lb/>
            to the courage and fidelity of the men, Bulla bade them <note type="footnote"> * This was Lucius Licinius Murena, who conducted the war against <lb/>

            make the attempt; and in the mean time he formed his <lb/>
            line and distributed his cavalry on each flank, himself <lb/>
            taking the right and giving Murena the command on the <lb/>
            left. The legati Galba * and Hortensius, with some <lb/>
            reserved cohorts in the rear, occupied the neighbouring <lb/>
            heights, to prevent the army from being attacked on the <lb/>
            flank, for it was observed that the enemy were placing a <lb/>
            strong body of cavalry and light infantry on their wings, <lb/>
            with the view of adapting that part of their battle to <lb/>
            ready and easy manoeuvres, their design being to extend <lb/>
            their line and to surround the Romans.</p>
          <p>XVIII. In the mean time the Chæroneians, whom Bulla <lb/>
            had placed under the command of Ericius, went round <lb/>
            Thurium without being perceived, and all at once showed <lb/>
            themselves to the enemy, who immediately falling into <lb/>
            great confusion, took to flight and sustained considerable <lb/>
            loss, but chiefly from themselves; for as they did not <lb/>
            stand their ground, but ran down the hill, they got <lb/>
            entangled among their own spears and shoved one another <lb/>
            down the rocks, while the Chæroneians pressing upon <lb/>
            them from above, wounded them in the parts which were <lb/>
            unprotected; and there fell of the enemy to the number <lb/>
            of three thousand. Part of those who got safe to the foot <lb/>
            of the hill, being met by Murena, whose troops were <lb/>
            already in order of battle, had their retreat cut off and <lb/>
            were destroyed: the rest forced their way to the army of <lb/>
            Archelaus, and, falling upon the line in disorder, caused a <lb/>
            general alarm and confusion, and some loss of time to the <lb/>
            generals; and this did them no small harm, for Bulla <lb/>
            promptly led his forces against the enemy while they <lb/>
            were still in disorder, and by quickly traversing the <lb/>
            interval between the two lines, deprived the scythe- <lb/>
            bearing chariots t of all opportunity of being effective. <note type="footnote"> * Kaltwasser has followed the reading "Gallus" in his version, <lb/>
            though, as he remarks in a note, this man is called Galba by Appian <lb/>
            (Mithridat. War, 43), and he is coupled with Hortensius, just as in <lb/>
            Plutarch. </note><note type="footnote"> t This clumsy military contrivance must generally have been a <lb/>
            failure. These chariots were useless in the battle between Cyrus and <lb/>
            his brother Artaxerxes B.O. 401. (Xenophon, Anabasis, i. 8.) Appian <lb/>
            (Mithridatic War, o. 42) mentions sixty of these chariots as being <lb/>
            driven against the Romans, who opened their ranks to make way for <lb/>
            them : the chariots were surrounded by the Roman soldiers in the rear <lb/>
            and destroyed. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            The efficacy of the chariots depends mainly on the space <lb/>
            they traverse, by which they acquire velocity and mo­ <lb/>
            mentum; but when the space is small their attack is <lb/>
            ineffectual and feeble, just like missiles that have not been <lb/>
            propelled with due force. Now this happened to the <lb/>
            barbarians. The first chariots were driven on without <lb/>
            any vigour, and came feebly against the ranks of the <lb/>
            Romans, who easily pushed them aside, and, clapping <lb/>
            their hands and laughing, called for more, as the people <lb/>
            do in the horse-races of the Circus.- Upon this the <lb/>
            infantry joined battle; the barbarians pushed forward <lb/>
            their long spears and endeavoured by locking their shields <lb/>
            to maintain their ranks in line : the Romans hurled their <lb/>
            javelins, and then drawing their swords, endeavoured to <lb/>
            beat aside the spears, that they might forthwith close <lb/>
            with the enemy; for they were irritated at seeing drawn <lb/>
            up in front of the enemy fifteen thousand slaves, whom <lb/>
            the king's generals had invited from the cities by a <lb/>
            proclamation of freedom, and enrolled among the hoplitæ.† <lb/>
            A Roman centurion is said to have remarked, that slaves <lb/>
            had only freedom of speech at the Saturnalia,‡ so far as <lb/>
            he knew. Now, owing to the depth of the ranks of these <lb/>
            slaves and their close order, it was some time before they <lb/>
            could be made to give way before the heavy-armed Roman <lb/>
            soldiers, and they also fought with more courage than one <lb/>
            expects from a slave; but the missiles from the slings <lb/>
            and the light javelins which were showered upon them <lb/>
            unsparingly by the Romans in the rear, at last made them <lb/>
            turn and put them into complete confusion.</p>

            Circus Maximus, which was used also for hunts of wild beasts. See <lb/>

            December, when people indulged themselves in feasting and revelry, <lb/>

            and acting as if they were freemen. The original" freedom of speech " <lb/>
            may mean a little more than these words convey. The point of the <lb/>
            centurion's remark, like many other jokes of antiquity, seems rather <lb/>
            blunt. He simply meant to express surprise at seeing slaves in an <lb/>
            army serving as soldiers-they whose only freedom, so far as he knew, <lb/>

            wing, in order to surround the Romans, Hortensius made <lb/>
            his cohorts advance at a run, with the intention of taking <lb/>
            the enemy in the flank; but as Archelaus suddenly <lb/>
            wheeled round with his two thousand horsemen, Hor­ <lb/>
            tensius was overpowered by numbers and retreated <lb/>
            towards the mountain region, being gradually separated <lb/>
            from the main bcdy of the army and in danger of being <lb/>
            completely hemmed in by the barbarians. Sulla, who <lb/>
            was on the right wing, which was not yet engaged in the <lb/>
            action, hearing of the danger of Hortensius, hastened to <lb/>
            relieve him. Archelaus conjecturing from the dust raised <lb/>
            by Sulla's troops how the matter was, left Hortensius, <lb/>
            and wheeling round moved towards the position which <lb/>
            Sulla had quitted (the right), expecting to find the <lb/>
            soldiers there without their general, and to defeat them. <lb/>
            At the same time Taxiles led the Chalkaspides against <lb/>
            Murena; and no w the shouts being raised from both <lb/>
            armies and re-echoed by the mountains, Sulla halted and <lb/>
            hesitated to which quarter he should move. Having <lb/>
            determined to maintain his own original position, he sent <lb/>
            Hortensius with four cohorts to support Murena, and <lb/>
            ordering the fifth to follow him, he hurried to the right <lb/>
            wing, which unaided was bravely resisting Archelaus; <lb/>
            but as soon as Sulla appeared, the Romans completely <lb/>
            broke the line of Archelaus, and pursued the barbarians <lb/>
            in disorderly flight to the river and Mount Akontium. <lb/>
            However, Sulla did not leave Murena alone in his danger­ <lb/>
            ous position, but hastened to help him. Seeing, however, <lb/>
            that the Romans were victorious here also, he joined in <lb/>
            the pursuit. Now many of the barbarians were cut down <lb/>
            in the plain, but the greatest number were destroyed in <lb/>
            the attempt to regain their entrenchments, and only ten <lb/>
            thousand out of so large a host made their escape to <lb/>
            Chalkis.* Sulla says in his Memoirs, that he missed only <lb/>
            fourteen of his own soldiers, and that ten of them showed <lb/>

            were Greeks invited from the other cities of Greece; for <lb/>
            Sulla could not be reconciled to the Thebans; and he <lb/>
            took from them half of their lands, which he dedicated to <lb/>
            the Pythian Apollo and Olympian Jupiter; and from the <lb/>
            revenue of these lands he ordered the sums of money which <lb/>

            was in fact directed against himself; and accordingly he <lb/>

            into Bœotia and occupied the country, being eager to <lb/>
            draw Sulla to an engagement, and paying no regard to <lb/>
            Archelaus, who dissuaded him from fighting : he even said <lb/>
            publicly that so many thousands could never have been de­ <lb/>
            stroyed if there had not been treachery. However, Sulla, <lb/>
            who quickly returned to Bœotia, showed Dorylaus that <lb/>
            Archelaus was a prudent man and had formed a very just <lb/>
            estimate of the courage of the Romans; for after a slight <lb/>
            skirmish with Sulla near Tilphossium,* Dorylaus was <lb/>
            himself the first among those who were not for deciding <lb/>
            the matter by a battle, but thought it best to prolong <lb/>
            the war till the Romans should be exhausted by want of <lb/>
            supplies. However, Archelaus was somewhat encouraged <lb/>
            by the position of their encampment near Orchomenus, <lb/>
            which was very favourable for battle to an army which <lb/>
            had the superiority in cavalry; for of all the plains in <lb/>
            Bœotia noted for their beauty and extent, this, which <lb/>
            commences at the city of Orchomenus, is the only one <lb/>
            which spreads without interruption and without any <lb/>
            trees, and it reaches to the marshes in which the river <lb/>
            Melas t is lost. The Melas rises close to Orchomenus, and <lb/>
            is the only river of Greece that is a copious and navigable <lb/>
            stream at its source; it also increases like the Nile about <lb/>
            the summer solstice, and the same plants grow on its <lb/>
            banks; but they produce no fruit and do not attain any <lb/>
            large size. Its course however is short, for the larger part <lb/>
            of the water is soon lost in obscure marshes overgrown <lb/>
            with shrubs: a small part joins the Kephisus somewhere <lb/>
            about the point where the lake is said to produce the reed <lb/>
            that is adapted for making musical pipes.</p>
          <p>XXI. The two armies being encamped near one another, <lb/>
            Archelaus kept quiet, but Sulla began to dig trenches on <note type="footnote"> * A mountain in Bœotia and a spring (Tilphussa) about fifty stadia <lb/>
            from Haliartus. (Pausanias, ix. 33.) Haliartus is on the south side <lb/>
            of the Lake Kopais. </note><note type="footnote"> † Orchomenus, one of the oldest towns in Bœotia and in Greece, is <lb/>

            Pausanias (ix. 38) says that the Melas rises seven stadia from Orcho <lb/>
            menus, and enters the lake Kephisus, otherwise called Kopais. </note> <note type="footnote">2A2 </note> <lb/>

            both sides with the view, if possible, of cutting off the <lb/>
            enemy from the hard ground and those parts which were <lb/>
            favourable to cavalry and driving them into the marshes. <lb/>
            However, the barbarians would not endure this, and as <lb/>
            soon as their generals allowed them to attack the Romans, <lb/>
            they rushed forward with so much vigour and force, that <lb/>
            not only were the men dispersed who were working at <lb/>
            the trenches, brut the greater part of the Roman troops <lb/>
            that were drawn up for their protection were involved <lb/>
            in the fight. Upon this Sulla leapt down from his horse, <lb/>
            and snatching up a standard, made his way through the <lb/>
            fugitives towards the enemy, crying, out, “ For my part, <lb/>
            Romans, it is fit I should die hero; as for you, when you are <lb/>
            asked where you deserted your Imperator, remember to say <lb/>
            it was in Orchomenus." These words made the soldiers <lb/>
            rally, and two cohorts came to their support from the right <lb/>
            wing, which Sulla led against the enemy and put them <lb/>
            to flight. He then led his soldiers back a short distance, <lb/>
            and after allowing them to take some food, he began again <lb/>
            to work at the trenches which were designed to enclose <lb/>
            the enemy's camp The barbarians made another attack <lb/>
            in better order than before; in which Diogenes, the son <lb/>
            of the wife of Archelaus, fell fighting bravely on the <lb/>
            right wing; and the bowmen being hard pressed by the <lb/>
            Romans and having no means of retreat, took their arrows <lb/>
            altogether in their hands, and using them like swords, <lb/>
            struck at the Romans, but, at last they were driven back <lb/>
            to their camp, where they spent a wretched night owing <lb/>
            to their wounds and great losses. As soon as day dawned <lb/>
            Bulla again led his soldiers up to the enemy's encampment <lb/>
            and again commenced working at the ditches. The enemy <lb/>
            came out in a great force, but Sulla put them to flight, <lb/>
            and as no one stood his ground after they were thrown <lb/>
            into disorder, Sulla stormed the camp. The swamps and <lb/>
            the lake were filled with the blood and bodies of those <lb/>
            who fell, and even to the present day many barbarian <lb/>
            bows, helmets, and pieces of iron cuirasses and swords are <lb/>
            found buried in the marshes, though it is near two <lb/>
            hundred * years since the battle. Such, according to the <note type="footnote"> * If we assume that it was exactly two hundred years, Plutarch wrote <lb/>
            this passage about A.D. 114, in the reign of Trajanus. This battle was <lb/>

            menus.</p>
          <p>XXII. Cinna and Carbo * were now conducting them­ <lb/>
            selves towards the chief men at Rome in an illegal and <lb/>
            violent manner, and many flying from their tyranny re­ <lb/>
            sorted to the camp of Sulla as a harbour of refuge, so <lb/>
            that in a short time a kind of Senate was formed about <lb/>
            him. Metella also, who had with difficulty escaped with <lb/>
            her children, came and reported that his house and farms <lb/>
            were burnt by his enemies, and she entreated him to go <lb/>
            to the assistance of his friends at Rome. Sulla was per­ <lb/>
            plexed what to do: he could not endure the thoughts of <lb/>
            neglecting his country in her present oppressed condition, <lb/>
            nor did he see how he could leave so great an undertaking <lb/>
            as the Mithridatic war imperfect. In the meantime there <lb/>
            came to him a merchant of Delos,f named Archelaus, <lb/>
            who secretly brought from Archelaus, the king'is general, <lb/>
            hopes of peace and certain proposals. Bulla was so well <lb/>
            pleased that he was eager for an interview with Archelaus, <lb/>
            and they met at Delium on the sea-coast, where the temple <lb/>
            of Apollo is. Archelaus, who began the conference, urged <lb/>
            Sulla to give up Asia and the Pontus, and to sail to Rome <lb/>
            to prosecute the war against his enemies, and he offered <lb/>
            him money, ships, and troops on behalf of the king. Sulla <lb/>
            in reply advised Archelaus not to trouble himself any <lb/>
            further about Mithridates, but to assume the kingly title <lb/>
            himself and to become an ally of Rome, and to give up <lb/>
            the ships of Mithridates. As Archelaus professed his <lb/>
            detestation of such treachery, Sulla said, “ You then, <lb/>
            Archelaus, who are a Cappadocian, and the slave of a <lb/>
            barbarian king, or, if you please, his friend—you refuse <lb/>
            to do a base deed for so splendid a reward, and yet <lb/>
            venture to talk about treachery to me who am a Roman <lb/>
            general, and am Sulla, as if you were not that Archelaus <lb/>
            who fled from Chæroneia with a few men out of your one <note type="footnote"> * Cn. Papirius Carbo was the colleague of Cinna in the consulship <lb/>

            small town in Bœotia, on the Euripus, where Bulla and Archelaus <lb/>

            hundred and twenty thousand, and were hid for two day a <lb/>
            in the marshes- of Orchomenus, and left Bœotia with all <lb/>
            the roads made impassable by the heaps of dead ? " Upon this <lb/>
            Archelaus changed his tone, and humbling himself, en­ <lb/>
            treated Sulla to give up the war and to come to terms <lb/>
            with Mithridates. Bulla accepted the proposal, and peace <lb/>
            was made on the following terms:—Mithridates was to <lb/>
            give up Asia† and Paphlagonia, and to surrender Bithynia <lb/>
            to Nikomedes, and Cappadocia to Ariobarzanes, to pay <lb/>
            down to the Romans two thousand talents, and to give <lb/>
            them seventy ships fitted with brass and completely <lb/>
            equipped; Sulla was to confirm Mithridates in the rest <lb/>
            of his possessions and to recognise him as an ally of the <lb/>
            Romans.</p>
          <p>XXIII. These terms being settled, Sulla retraced his <lb/>
            steps and marched through Thessaly and Macedonia to <lb/>
            the Hellespont in company with Archelaus, whom he <lb/>
            treated with great respect. Archelaus fell dangerously <lb/>
            ill at Larissa, on which Sulla stopped his march and paid <lb/>
            as much attention to him as if he had been one of his own <lb/>
            officers and fellow-generals. This gave rise to some sus­ <lb/>
            picion that the battle of Chæroneia was not fairly fought, <lb/>
            which was strengthened by the fact that Sulla restored <lb/>
            all the friends of Mithridates whom he had taken pri- <lb/>
            Boners, except Aristion‡ the tyrant, who was an enemy of <lb/>
            Archelaus, and whom he caused to be poisoned: but the <lb/>
            most convincing proof of all was Sulla's giving the Cappa­ <lb/>
            docian ten thousand plethra of land in Eubœa, and the <lb/>
            title of friend and ally of the Romans. However, Bulla <lb/>
            makes his apology about these matters in his Memoirs. <lb/>
            Ambassadors from Mithridates now arrived, and were <lb/>
            ready to accede to all the terms agreed on, except that the <lb/>
            king would not consent to give up Paphlagonia, and as to <note type="footnote"> * Appian (Mithridat. War, c. 50) says that Archelaus hid himself <lb/>
            in a marsh, and afterwards made his escape to Chalkis. Sulla's arro­ <lb/>
            gance is well characterized by his speech. The Cappadocians were <lb/>
            considered a mean and servile people, and their character became <lb/>
            proverbial. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Roman Province of Asia. Compare Appian (Mithridat. War, <lb/>

            the ships he dissented altogether; on which Bulla in a <lb/>
            passion exclaimed, " What say ye ? Mithlidates claims to <lb/>
            keep Paphlagonia, and refuses to abide by the agreement <lb/>
            about the ships; I thought he would have been thankful if <lb/>
            I left him his right hand, which has destroyed so many <lb/>
            Romans. However, he will soon speak another language <lb/>
            when I have crossed over to Asia. At present let him stay in <lb/>
            Pergamum and there direct the conduct of a campaign <lb/>
            which he has not seen." The ambassadors were so much <lb/>
            alarmed that they said nothing, but Archelaus implored <lb/>
            Bulla and tried to soften his anger, clinging to his hands <lb/>
            with tears in his eyes. At last he prevailed on Sulla to <lb/>
            let him go to Mithridates, and he promised to effect a <lb/>
            peace on Sulla's own terms, or to kill himself. Sulla <lb/>
            accordingly sent Archelaus to Mithridates, and in the <lb/>
            mean time he invaded Mædike,* and having ravaged the <lb/>
            greater part of it, returned to Macedonia, and found <lb/>
            Archelaus at Philippic who reported that all was favour­ <lb/>
            able, but that Mithridates much wished to have an inter­ <lb/>
            view with him. Mithridates was mainly induced to this by <lb/>
            the circumstance that Fimbria, after murdering the consul <lb/>
            Flaccus, who belonged to the opposite faction, and de­ <lb/>
            feating the generals of Mithridates, was advancing against <lb/>
            the king himself. It was fear of Fimbria that made <lb/>
            Mithridates more inclined to make a friend of Sulla.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Accordingly they met at Dardan<foreign xml:lang="grc">̀</foreign>us t in the <note type="footnote"> * Mædike appears to be the right name. Thucydides (ii. 98) calls <lb/>
            the people Mædi : they were a Thracian people. Compare Strabo <lb/>
            (p. 316). Appian (Mithridat. War, c. 55) speaks of this expedition as <lb/>
            directed against the Sinti, who were neighbours of the Mædi, and other <lb/>
            nations which bordered on Macedonia, and annoyed it by their pre­ <lb/>
            datory incursions. BullA. thus kept his soldiers employed, which was <lb/>
            the practice of all prudent Roman commanders, and enriched them <lb/>
            with booty at the same time. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is the old town called Krenides, or the Little Springs, which <lb/>

            Troad: Mithridates had there two hundred rowing-ships, <lb/>
            twenty thousand heavy-armed soldiers, six thousand horse­ <lb/>
            men, and many of his scythe-bearing chariots: Sulla had <lb/>
            four cohorts and two hundred horsemen. Mithridates <lb/>
            advanced to meet Bulla and held out his hand, on which <lb/>
            Sulla asked him if he would put an end to the war on the <lb/>
            terms agreed to by Archelaus. As the king made no <lb/>
            reply, Sulla said, “Well, those who sue must speak first; <lb/>
            conquerors may remain silent." Mithridates began an <lb/>
            apology, in which he partly imputed the origin of the war <lb/>
            to the deities, and partly threw the blame on the Romans; <lb/>
            but Bulla cut him short by saying, that he had long ago <lb/>
            been told, and now he knew by his own experience, that <lb/>
            Mithridates was a most skilful speaker, inasmuch as he <lb/>
            had no difficulty in finding words to justify acts which <lb/>
            were so base and so contrary to all right. Bulla went on <lb/>
            to recapitulate all that Mithridates had done, reproaching <lb/>
            him in bitter terms, and he then asked him again, if he <lb/>
            would abide by the agreement of Archelaus. Mithridates <lb/>
            said that he would ; on which Sulla embraced him, threw <lb/>
            his arms round him and kissed him; he then brought <lb/>
            forward the kings Ariobarzanes and Kikomedes, and recon­ <lb/>
            ciled Mithridates to them. After surrendering to Bulla <lb/>
            seventy ships and five hundred bowmen, Mithridates sailed <lb/>
            off to the Pontus. Sulla perceived that his soldiers were <lb/>
            dissatisfied at the settlement of the war : they thought it <lb/>
            a shame that the greatest enemy of the Romans, who had <lb/>
            contrived the massacre of one hundred and fifty thousand <lb/>
            Romans in Asia in one day, should be seen sailing off with <lb/>
            the wealth and the spoils of Asia, which he had been <lb/>
            plundering and levying contributions on for four years; <lb/>
            Sulla apologised to the soldiers by saying that he should <lb/>
            not be able to oppose both Fimbria and Mithridates, if <lb/>
            they were united against him.</p>

            who was encamped near Thyateira,* and halting there, <note type="footnote"> of many other events in this war. Appian is perhaps the better au­ <lb/>
            thority for the bare historical facta: but so far as concerns the conduct <lb/>
            and character of Sulla on this and other occasions, Plutarch has painted <lb/>
            the man true to the life. </note><note type="footnote"> * Thyateira was a town in Lydia about 45 miles from Pergamum. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            began to throw up his intrenchments. Fimbria'is men <lb/>
            coming out of their camp in their jackets embraced the <note type="footnote"> Bulla left L. Lucullus behind him to collect the money. (See Life of <lb/>
            Lucullus, c. 4.) The story of Fimbria in Appian (Mithridat. War, <lb/>
            a. 69, 70) differs from that of Plutarch in some respects, but it is near <lb/>
            enough to show that though these two writers apparently followed <lb/>
            different authorities, Plutarch has given the facts substantially correct. </note><note type="footnote"> When Sulla was within two stadia of Fimbria, he sent him orders to <lb/>
            give up the army, which he was illegally commanding. Fimbria sent <lb/>
            back an insulting message to the effect that Sulla also had no right to the <lb/>
            command which he held. While Sulla was throwing up his intrench­ <lb/>
            ments, and many of Fimbria's soldiers were openly leaving him, <lb/>
            Fimbria summoned those who still remained to a meeting, and urged <lb/>
            them to stay with him. Upon the soldiers saying that they would not <lb/>
            fight against their fellow-citizens, Fimbria tore his dress, and began to <lb/>
            intreat them severally. But the soldiers turned a deaf ear to him, and <lb/>
            the desertions became still more numerous, on which Fimbria went round <lb/>
            to the tents of the officers, and bribing some of them, he called another <lb/>
            meeting, and commanded the soldiers to take the oath to him. As <lb/>
            those who were hired by him called out that he ought to summon the men <lb/>
            by name to take the oath, he called by the crier those who had received <lb/>
            favours from him, and he called Nonius first who had been his partner <lb/>
            in everything. Nonius refused to take the oath, and Fimbria drew <lb/>
            his sword and threatened to kill him, but as there was a general shout, <lb/>
            he became alarmed and desisted. However he induced a slave by <lb/>
            money and the promise of his freedom to go to Bulla as a deserter, and <lb/>
            to attempt his life. The man as he came near the act was alarmed, <lb/>
            and this gave rise to suspicion, which led to his being seized, and he <lb/>
            confessed. The army of Sulla, full of indignation aud contempt, sur­ <lb/>
            rounded the camp of Fimbria, and abused him, calling him Athenion, <lb/>
            which was the name of the fellow who put himself at the head of the <lb/>
            rebel runaway slaves in Sicily, and was a king for a few days. Fimbria <lb/>
            now despairing came to the rampart, and invited Bulla to a conference. <lb/>
            But Sulla sent Rutilius; and this first of all annoyed Fimbria, as he <lb/>
            was not honoured with a meeting, which is granted even to enemies. <lb/>
            On his asking for pardon for any error that he might have committed, <lb/>
            being still a young man, Rutilius promised that Sulla would allow him <lb/>
            to pass safe to the coast, if he would sail away from Asia, of which <lb/>
            Sulla was proconsul. Fimbria replied that he had better means than <lb/>
            that, and going to Pergamum and entering the temple of Æsculapius, <lb/>
            he pierced himself with his sword. As the wound was not mortal, lie <lb/>
            bade his slave plunge the sword into his body. The slave killed his <lb/>
            master, and then killed himself on the body. Thus died Fimbria, who <lb/>
            had done much mischief to Asia after Mithridates. Sulla aHowed <lb/>
            Fimbria's fr&lt; edmen to bury their master; adding that he would not <lb/>
            imitate Cinna and Marius, who had condemned many persons to death <lb/>
            at Rome, and also refused to allow their bodies to be buried. The <lb/>
            army of Fimbria now came over to Sulla, and was received by him <lb/>
            and united with his own. Bulla also commissioned Curio to restore</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            soldiers of Sulla, and began to assist them zealously in <lb/>
            their works. Fimbria seeing that his soldiers had de­ <lb/>
            serted him, and fearing Sulla’s unforgiving temper, <lb/>
            committed suicide in the camp. Bulla now levied a <lb/>
            contribution on Asia to the amount of twenty thousand <lb/>
            talents: and he reduced individuals to beggary by the <lb/>
            violence and exactions which he permitted to the soldiers <lb/>
            who were quartered in their houses. He issued an order <lb/>
            that the master of a house should daily supply the soldier <lb/>
            who was quartered on him with four tetradrachmæ, and <lb/>
            with dinner for himself and as many of his friends as he <lb/>
            chose to invite; a centurion was to receive fifty drachma <lb/>
            daily, and to be supplied with two garments, one to wear <lb/>
            in the house and the other when he went abroad.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Sulla set sail from Ephesus with all his ships, <lb/>
            and on the third day anchored in the Peiræus. After <lb/>
            being initiated into the Eleusinian * mysteries, he appro­ <lb/>
            priated to himself the library of Apellikon † of Teos, <note type="footnote"> Nioomedes to Bithynia and Arioharzanes to Cappadocia, and he wrote <lb/>
            to the Senate about all these matters, pretending that he did not know <lb/>
            that he had been declared an enemy. </note><note type="footnote"> * The original is simply " after being initiated;” but the Eleusinian <lb/>
            mysteries are meant. The city of Eleusis was in Attica, and the sacred <lb/>
            rites were those of Ceres and Proserpine (Demeter and Persephone). <lb/>
            Those only who were duly initiated could partake in these ceremonies. <lb/>
            An intruder ran the risk of being put to death. Livius (31, o. 14) <lb/>
            tells a story of two Akarnanian youths who were not initiated, and <lb/>
            during the time of the Initia, as he calls them, entered the temple of <lb/>
            Ceres with the rest of the crowd, knowing nothing of the nature of <lb/>
            the ceremonies. Their language and some questions that they put, <lb/>
            betrayed them, and they were conducted to the superintendents of the <lb/>
            temple; and though it was clear that they had erred entirely through <lb/>
            ignorance, they were put to death as if they had committed an abomin­ <lb/>
            able crime. Toleration was no part of the religious system of An­ <lb/>
            tiquity; that is, nothing was permitted which was opposed to any <lb/>
            religious institution, though there was toleration for a great variety. <lb/>
            Many illustrious persons were initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries, <lb/>
            which were maintained until Christianity became the general religion <lb/>
            of the Empire. Marcus Aurelius, when he visited Athens, was initiated. <lb/>
            The ceremonial of the temple may be collected to a certain extent from <lb/>
            the ancient writers, but no one has yet succeeded in divining what <lb/>
            were the peculiar doctrines of this place. </note><note type="footnote"> t Much has been written about this story, which cannot be literally <lb/>
            true. The writings of Aristotle were not unknown to his immediate </note> <lb/>

            which contained most of the writings of Aristotle and <lb/>
            Theophrastus. The works of these two philosophers were <lb/>
            not then well known to people in general. It is said <lb/>
            that when the library was brought to Rome, Tyrannic <lb/>
            the grammarian arranged most cf the books, and that <lb/>
            Andronikus of Rhodes having procured copies from <lb/>
            Tyrannic, published them, and made the tables which are <lb/>
            now in use. It appears that the older Peripatetics were <lb/>
            indeed well-instructed men, and devoted to letters, but <lb/>
            they did not possess many of the writings of Aristotle <lb/>
            and Theophrastus, nor yet correct copies, owing to the <lb/>
            circumstances that the books came into the hands of the <lb/>
            heirs of Neleus of Skepsis, to whom Theophrastus be­ <lb/>
            queathed them, and that they were ignorant persons, who <lb/>
            never troubled themselves about such matters. While <lb/>
            Bulla was staying at Athens, he was seized with a numb­ <lb/>
            ness in his feet, accompanied with a feeling of heaviness, <lb/>
            which Strabo* calls “a stammering of gout." Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly he crossed the sea to Ædepsus,†where he used the <lb/>
            warm springs, at the same time indulging in relaxation <note type="footnote">followers. If there is any truth in this story as told by Plutarch and <lb/>
            Strabo (p. 608) it must refer to the original manuscripts of Aristotle. <lb/>
            Part of the text of Plutarch is here manifestly corrupt. The subject <lb/>
            has been examined by several writers. See art. “Aristotle," Biog. <lb/>

            in his Life of Lucullus, c. 28. </note><note type="footnote"> t These warm springs, which still exist, are on the west coast of <lb/>
            Eubœa, opposite to the mainland. They were much resorted to in <lb/>
            Plutarch's time, as appears from his Symposiaca (iv. Probl. 4). The <lb/>
            place is named Galepsus in Wyttenbach's edition, but in anote the editor <lb/>
            admits that the true name is Ædepsus. Demetrius Calatianus (quoted <lb/>
            by Strabo, p. 60), who had recorded all the earthquakes in Greece, <lb/>
            says that the hot springs at Thermopylae and at Ædepsus once ceased <lb/>
            to flow for three days owing to an earthquake, and those of Ædepsus, <lb/>
            when they flowed again, broke out in a fresh place. The hot springs <lb/>
            near Cape Thema in Eubœa are supposed to be those of Ædepsus. <lb/>
            They are more copious than the springs of Thermopylæ on the opposite <lb/>
            mainland, but of the same kind. " The water rushes down in a copious <lb/>
            stream into the sea, the vapour from which is visible at a considerable <lb/>
            distance.” (Penny Cyclopædia, art. “Eubœa.”) </note> <lb/>

            .and spending all his time in the company of actors. As <lb/>
            he was walking about on the sea-shore, some fishermen <lb/>
            presented him with some very fine fish; Sulla was much <lb/>
            pleased with the present, but on hearing that the men <lb/>
            belonged to Halææ,* he said, What, is there an Halæan <lb/>
            still alive? For it happened, that while pursuing his <lb/>
            enemies after the victory at Orchomenus, he destroyed at <lb/>
            once three Bœotian cities, Anthedon, Larymna, and Halææ. <lb/>
            The men were struck speechless with fear, but Sulla <lb/>
            with a smile bade them go away in good heart, for the <lb/>
            intercessors they had brought were no mean ones, and <lb/>
            not to be despised. Upon this the Halæans say they took <lb/>
            courage and again occupied their city.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Sulla went through Thessaly and Macedonia <lb/>
            to the sea-coast, where he made preparations to cross from <lb/>
            Dyrrachium t to Brundisium with twelve hundred ships. <lb/>
            Near to Dyrrachium is Apollonia, and near to Apollonia <lb/>
            is the Nymphæum,‡ a sacred spot, where perpetual streams <lb/>
            of fire rise in various places out of a green grassy valley. <lb/>
            It is said that a sleeping satyr was caught there, such a <lb/>
            one as sculptors and painters represent, and was brought <lb/>
            to Sulla and questioned by many interpreters as to who <lb/>
            he was; but he spoke with difficulty, and what he did <note type="footnote"> * Halææ should probably be written Halæ. It was near the Euripus, <lb/>

            (41, c. 45), and Ælian (Various History, 13, c. 16). I do not know if <lb/>
            this spot has been examined by any modern traveller. It is a matter <lb/>
            of some interest to ascertain how long a phenomenon of this kind has <lb/>
            lasted. The pitch-springs of Zante (Zakynthus), which Herodotus <lb/>
            visited and describes (iv. 195), still produce the native pitch. Strabo, <lb/>
            who had not seen the Nymphæum, describes it thus after the account <lb/>
            of Poseidonius: “In the territory of Apollonia is a place called the <lb/>
            Nymphæum; it is a rock which sends forth fire, and at the base of it <lb/>
            are springs of warm asphaltus, the asphaltio earth, as it appears, being <lb/>
            in a state of combustion; and there is a mine of it near on a hill. <lb/>
            Whatever is out out, is filled up again in course of time, as the <lb/>
            earth which is thrown into the excavations changes into asphaltus, as <lb/>
            Poseidonius says." We cannot conclude from this confused description <lb/>
            what the real nature of the phenomenon was. Probably the asphaltus <lb/>
            or bitumen was occasionally set on fire by the neighbouring people. <lb/>

            utter was unintelligible, and something like a compound <lb/>
            of the neighing of a horse and the bleating of a goat; <lb/>
            upon which Sulla, who was startled at the monster, <lb/>
            ordered him to be removed. Sulla was now about to take <lb/>
            his soldiers over the sea, but he feared that when they <lb/>
            landed in Italy they would disperse to their several cities; <lb/>
            however, the soldiers voluntarily took an oath to abide <lb/>
            by him, and not to do any damage in Italy from set <lb/>
            design; seeing also that he required much money, they <lb/>
            all contributed something from what they had, each <lb/>
            according to his means. However, Sulla would not <lb/>
            receive the contribution, but after commending their zeal <lb/>
            and encouraging them he proceeded to cross the sea, as he <lb/>
            expresses it in his Memoirs, to oppose fifteen hostile com­ <lb/>
            manders at the head of four hundred and fifty cohorts.- <lb/>
            The deity gave him sure prognostics of success; for upon <lb/>
            his sacrificing immediately on landing in Italy near <lb/>
            Tarentum, the liver of the animal was found to have on <lb/>
            it the figure of a crown t of bay with two ribands attached <lb/>
            to it. A short time also before he crossed the sea, two <lb/>
            large he-goats were seen in Campania near Mount Hephæus, <lb/>
            in the daytime, fighting, and in all respects acting like <lb/>
            men engaged in a contest. But it was only a vision, and <lb/>
            it gradually rose up from the ground and dispersed in the <lb/>
            air in various directions like dark phantoms, and finally <lb/>
            disappeared. No long time after, in this very spot, when <lb/>
            the younger Marius and the consul Norbanus‡ came upon <lb/>
            him at the head of a large force, Sulla, without having <lb/>
            time to form his battle or to dispose his companies, but <lb/>
            merely availing himself of the spirit that animated all his <lb/>
            men, and their impetuous courage, put to flight his <note type="footnote"> * The Cohors was the tenth part of a Roman Legion. Appian (Civil <lb/>
            Wars, i. 82) says that on this occasion the opponents of Sulla made <lb/>
            their cohorts contain 500 men each, so that a legion would contain <lb/>
            5000 men. According to this estimate there were 90,000 men under <lb/>
            arms in Italy to oppose Suna, who had five legions of Italian soldiers, <lb/>
            six thousand cavalry and some men from Peloponnesus and Macedonia; <lb/>
            in all forty thousand men. (Appian, Civil Wars, i. 79.) Appian says <lb/>

            opponents, and shut Norbanus up in Capua with the loss <lb/>
            of seven thousand of his soldiers. It was this success, as <lb/>
            some say, which prevented his soldiers from dispersing to <lb/>
            their several cities, and encouraged them to stay with <lb/>
            Sulla and to despise their opponents, though many times <lb/>
            more numerous than themselves. At Silvium,* as Sulla <lb/>
            says, a slave of one Pontius, moved by a divine impulse, <lb/>
            met him and declared that he brought from Bellona <lb/>
            assurance of superiority in war and victory, but that if he <lb/>
            did not make haste the Capitol would be burnt; and this is <lb/>
            said to have happened on the very day which the man <lb/>
            foretold, being the day before the Nones of Quintilis, <lb/>
            which we now call July. Further, Marcus Lucullus, one <lb/>
            of Sulla's commanders, was opposed at Fidentia† with <lb/>
            sixteen cohorts to fifty of the enemy, and though he had <lb/>
            confidence in the spirit of his men, he was discouraged <lb/>
            because a greater part of them were unarmed. While he <lb/>
            was considering and hesitating what to do, a gentle breeze <lb/>
            blowing from the adjoining plain, which was covered <lb/>
            with grass, carried many of the flowers to the army of <lb/>
            Lucullus, and spontaneously strewed them about, so that <lb/>
            they rested and fell on the men’s shields and helmets, <lb/>
            which seemed to their opponents to be crowned with <lb/>
            chaplets. Thus encouraged, the soldiers of Lucullus <lb/>
            engaged, and gained a victory, with the loss to the <lb/>
            opposite party of eighteen thousand men and their camp. <lb/>
            This Lucullus was the brother of the Lucullus who after­ <lb/>
            wards defeated Mithridates and Tigranes.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Sulla, perceiving that he was still surrounded <lb/>
            by many hostile camps and large forces, treacherously <lb/>
            invited Scipio‡ one of the consuls, to come to terms. <note type="footnote"> * Silvium is a town in Apulia on the Appian road, on the Apen­ <lb/>
            nines. As to the burning of the Capitol, see Appian, Civil Wars, i. 86. </note><note type="footnote"> t Fidentia was in North Italy not far from Plaoentia (Piacenza): it <lb/>
            is now Borgo San Donnino. Appian (Civil Wars, i. 92) speaks of this <lb/>
            battle near Placentia, which Lucullus gained over some of Carbo’s <lb/>
            troops, not over Carbo himself, as is stated by some modem writers. <lb/>
            Carbo was now in Central Italy. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Bulla, with Metellus Pius, who had joined him (Appian, Civil Wars, <lb/>
            i. 80), met L. Scipio near Teanum in Campania. Sertorius was with <lb/>
            Scipio. The circumstances are told by Appian (Civil Wars, i. 86) as <lb/>
            usual with more minuteness and very clearly. The main story is <lb/>
            sorrect in Plutarch. </note> <lb/>

            Scipio accepted the proposal, which was followed by many <lb/>
            meetings and conferences, but Sulla continually threw <lb/>
            impediments and pretexts in the way of a final agree­ <lb/>
            ment, and in the mean time he corrupted Scipio's soldiers <lb/>
            by means of his own men, who were as practised in all <lb/>
            kinds of deceit and fraud as their commander. Going <lb/>
            within the intrenchments of Scipio and mingling with <lb/>
            his soldiers, they gained over some by giving them <lb/>
            money, others by promises, and the rest by flattery <lb/>
            and persuasion. At last Sulla with twenty cohorts <lb/>
            approached the camp of Scipio, and his soldiers saluted <lb/>
            those of Scipio, who returned the salute and came over to <lb/>
            them. Scipio, thus deserted, was taken prisoner in his <lb/>
            tent, but set at liberty; and Sulla with the twenty <lb/>
            cohorts, like so many tame birds, having entrapped forty <lb/>
            of the enemy, led them all back to his camp. On <lb/>
            this occasion, it is said, Carbo observed that he had to <lb/>
            contend in bulla both with a lion and a fox, but the fox <lb/>
            gave him most trouble. After this, in the neighbourhood <lb/>
            of Signia,* Marius at the head of eighty-four cohorts <lb/>
            challenged Sulla to battle; and Sulla was very ready for <lb/>
            the contest on that day, for he happened to have had a <lb/>
            vision in his sleep of this sort :-He dreamed that the <lb/>
            elder Marius, who had long been dead, was advising his <lb/>
            son to beware of the following day, as it would bring him <lb/>
            heavy misfortune. This was the reason that Sulla was <lb/>
            eager to fight, and he sent for Dolabella, ‡ who was en­ <lb/>
            camped at some distance. But as the enemy occupied <lb/>

            B.C. 82, when Cn. Papirius Carbo was consul for the third time with <lb/>
            the younger Marius. It appears that Sulla's progress towards Rome <lb/>
            was not very rapid. Appian (Civil Wars, i. 87) places the battle at <lb/>

            roads at the same time; and it happened that much rain <lb/>
            also fell, and added to the fatigue of their labour. Upon <lb/>
            this, the centurions coming up to Bulla, begged him to <lb/>
            defer the battle, and pointed out to him that the soldiers <lb/>
            were exhausted by fatigue and were lying on the ground <lb/>
            with their shields under them. Bulla consented unwill­ <lb/>
            ingly, and gave orders for the army to halt there; but <lb/>
            while they were beginning to throw up their rampart <lb/>
            and dig their trenches, Marius advanced against them <lb/>
            confidently at the head of his troops, expecting to disperse <lb/>
            them in their state of disorder and confusion. Now the <lb/>
            dæmon made good the words that Sulla heard in his <lb/>
            dream ; for his soldiers, transported with indignation and <lb/>
            stopping their work. fixed their spears in the ground close <lb/>
            to the trenches, and drawing their swords with a loud <lb/>
            shout, were forthwith at close quarters with the enemy. <lb/>
            The soldiers of Marius did not stand their ground long, <lb/>
            and there was a great slaughter of them in their flight. <lb/>
            Marius, who fled to Præneste,* found the gates closed, but <lb/>
            a rope being let down from the walls, he fastened himself <lb/>
            to it, and was drawn up into the city. Some historians <lb/>
            say, and Fenestellat among them, that Marius saw <lb/>
            nothing of the battle, but that being exhausted by want <lb/>
            of sleep and fatigue he lay down on the ground in the shade, <lb/>
            and as soon as the signal was given for battle, fell asleep, <lb/>
            and that he was roused with difficulty when the flight <lb/>
            began. Sulla says that he lost only twenty-three men <lb/>
            in this battle, and that he killed of the enemy twenty <lb/>
            thousand, and took eight thousand alive. He was equally <lb/>

            combatant attacking an exhausted athlete, Telesinus the <lb/>
            Samnite was very near tripping up Sulla and laying him <lb/>
            prostrate at the gates of Rome. Telesinus was hastening <lb/>
            with Lamponius the Lucanian and a strong force to <lb/>
            Præneste, in order to rescue Marius, who was besieged; <lb/>
            but finding that Sulla in his front and Pompeius in his <lb/>
            rear were coming against him, and that he could neither <lb/>
            advance nor retreat, like a brave and experienced man he <lb/>
            broke up his encampment by night and marched with all <lb/>
            his force against Rome. And indeed he was very near <lb/>
            surprising the city, which was unguarded; however, <lb/>
            halting about ten stadia from the Colline gate, he passed <lb/>
            the night there, full of confidence and elated with hope, <lb/>
            as he had got the advantage over so many great generals. <lb/>
            At daybreak the most distinguished young men came out <lb/>
            on horseback to oppose him, but many of them fell, and <lb/>
            among them Claudius Appius,‡ a man of noble rank and <lb/>
            good character. This naturally caused confusion in the <lb/>
            city, and there were women shrieking and people hurrying <lb/>
            in all directions, in expectation that the city was going to <lb/>
            be stormed, when Balbus appeared first, coming at full <note type="footnote"> * Carbo lost courage and ran away. He got safe to the African <lb/>
            coast, whence, with many men of rank, he made his way to Sicily, and <lb/>
            thence to the small island of Cossyra. On. Pompeius sent men to se ize <lb/>
            him, who caught Carbo and his company : Carbo’s followers were im­ <lb/>
            mediately put to death pursuant to the orders of Pompeius. Carbo <lb/>
            was brought to Pompeius, and placed at his feet in chains; and after <lb/>
            Pompeius had insulted him who had thrice been consul by pronouncing <lb/>
            an har angue over him. Carbo was put to death, and his head was sent <lb/>
            to Sulla. (Appian, Civil Wars, i. )The statement of Plutarch <lb/>
            (Pompeius, c. 10) agrees with that of Appian. These and other acts <lb/>
            of Pompeius should be remembered by those who are inclined to pity <lb/>
            his fate. He was probably under a necessity to put Carbo to d( ath <lb/>

            speed from Sulla with seven hundred horsemen. Balbus <lb/>
            just halted long enough to allow his men to dry the <lb/>
            sweat from their horses: then bridling them again, they <lb/>
            advanced quickly and engaged with the enemy. In the <lb/>
            mean time Sulla also appeared, and ordering the advanced <lb/>
            ranks to take some refreshment, he began to put them in <lb/>
            order of battle. Dolabella and Torquatus earnestly en­ <lb/>
            treated him to pause, and not to put all to the hazard with <lb/>
            his exhausted soldiers; they said, the contest was not with <lb/>
            Carbo and Marius, but with Samnites and Lucanians, the <lb/>
            most deadly and warlike enemies of Rome: but Sulla, <lb/>
            without paying any regard to them, ordered the trumpets <lb/>
            to sound the charge, though it was now about the tenth <lb/>
            hour. The battle began, and was fiercer than any that <lb/>
            was fought in this campaign. The right wing, where <lb/>
            Crassus commanded, was completely successful; but the <lb/>
            left was hard pressed, and in a dangerous plight, when <lb/>
            Sulla came to its support mounted on a very spirited and <lb/>
            fleet white horse, by which he was easily distinguished <lb/>
            from the rest, and two of the enemy's soldiers, fixing their <lb/>
            javelins, prepared to aim at him, Sulla did not see them, <lb/>
            but his groom whipped the horse, which just carried his <lb/>
            rider so far out of the reach of the spears that they passed <lb/>
            close to the horse's tail, and stuck in the ground. It is <lb/>
            said that Bulla always carried about with him in his <lb/>
            bosom, in battle, a small golden figure of Apollo, which <lb/>
            he got from Delphi, and that he then kissed it, and said, <lb/>
            “0 Pythian Apollo, after raising the fortunate Bulla <lb/>
            Cornelius in so many contests to glory and renown, wilt <lb/>
            thou throw him prostrate hero, at the gates of his native <lb/>
            city, and so bring him to perish most ignobly with his <lb/>
            fellow-citizens?” After this address to the god it is <lb/>
            said that Sulla entreated some, and threatened and laid <lb/>
            hold of others ; but at last, the left wing being completely <lb/>
            broken, he was mingled with the fugitives and made his <lb/>
            escape to the camp with the loss of many of his friends <lb/>
            and men of note. Not a few of the citizens also, who had <lb/>
            come to see the fight, were killed and trampled down, so <lb/>
            that it was thought all was over with the city, and the <lb/>
            blockade of Marius was all but raised, for many of the <lb/>
            fugitives made their way to Praeneste, and urged Ofella <lb/>

            Lucretius,* who had been appointed to conduct the siege, <lb/>
            to break up his quarters with speed, as Sulla was killed, <lb/>
            and Rome in the possession of the enemy.</p>
          <p>XXX. It was now far on in the night when men came <lb/>
            to Sulla's camp from Crassus to get something to eat for <lb/>
            him and his soldiers, for after putting the enemy to flight <lb/>
            they had pursued them to Antemnæ,† and there encamped. <lb/>
            U pon this intelligence, and that most of the enemy were <lb/>
            killed, Sulla came to Antemnæ at daybreak. Here three <lb/>
            thousand soldiers sent to him to propose to surrender, and <lb/>
            Bulla promised them their lives if they would punish the <lb/>
            rest of his enemies before they joined him. Trusting to <lb/>
            his promise, these men attacked their comrades, and a <lb/>
            great number on both sides were cut to pieces. However, <lb/>
            Bulla got together the soldiers who had offered to sur­ <lb/>
            render and those who had survived the massacre, to the <lb/>
            number of six thousand, in the Circus,‡ and at the same time <lb/>
            he summoned the Senate to the temple of Bellona. As <note type="footnote"> * See o. 33. Appian (Civil Wars, f. 93) gives a different account of <lb/>
            this affair before the Colline gate, but agrees with Plutarch in stating <lb/>
            that-Sulla's right wing was successful and the left was defeated. He <lb/>
            says that Telesinus fell in the battle. </note><note type="footnote"> t Antemnæ was a few miles from Rome, near the junction of the <lb/>

            took place in the Circus Flaminius, which was near the temple of <lb/>
            Bellona. </note><note type="footnote"> Plutarch here starts a question which suggests itself to all men who <lb/>
            have had any experience. It is a common remark that a loon who has <lb/>
            been raised from a low degree to a high station, or has become rich <lb/>
            from being poor, is no longer the same man. Nobody expects those <lb/>
            whom he has known in the same station as himself to behave them­ <lb/>
            selves in the same way when they are exalted above it. Nobody ex­ <lb/>
            pects a man who has got power to be the same man that he was in an <lb/>
            humble station. Any man who has lived a reasonable time in the <lb/>
            world and had extensive conversation with it knows this to be true. <lb/>
            But is the man changed, or are his latent qualities only made apparent <lb/>
            by his changed circumstances? The truth seems to be that latent <lb/>
            qualities are developed by opportunity. All men have the latent <lb/>
            capacities of pride, arrogance, tyranny, and cruelty. Cruelty perhaps <lb/>
            requires the most opportunities for its development; and these oppor­ <lb/>
            tunities are, power, fear, and opposition to his will. It has been well <lb/>
            observed, that all men are capable of crime, but different circumstances <lb/>
            are necessary to develop this capacity in different men. All have their <lb/>
            price; and some may be bought cheap. He who is above the tempta- </note><note type="footnote">2B2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            soon as he began to speak, the men who were appointed <lb/>
            to do the work began to cut down the six thousand men. <lb/>
            A cry naturally arose from so many men being butchered <lb/>
            in a narrow space, and the Senators were startled; but <lb/>
            Sulla preserving the same unmoved expression of coun­ <lb/>
            tenance, bade them attend to what he was saying, and <lb/>
            not trouble themselves about what was going on outside; <lb/>
            it was only some villains who were being punished by his <lb/>
            orders. This made even the dullest Roman see that there <lb/>
            was merely an exchange of tyrants, not a total change. <lb/>
            Now Marius was always cruel, and he grew more so, and <lb/>
            the possession of power did not change his disposition. <lb/>
            But Sulla at first used his fortune with moderation and <lb/>
            like a citizen of a free state, and he got the reputation of <lb/>
            being a leader who, though attached to the aristocratical <lb/>
            party, still regarded the interests of the people; besides <lb/>
            this, he was from his youth fond of mirth, and so soft to <lb/>
            pity as to be easily moved to tears. It was not without <lb/>
            reason, then, that his subsequent conduct fixed on the <lb/>
            possession of great power the imputation that it does not <lb/>
            let men's tempers abide by their original habits, but <lb/>
            makes them violent, vain, and inhuman. Now whether <note type="footnote"> tion of money may yield to other temptations. The possession of <lb/>
            power is the greatest temptation of all, as it offers the greatest oppor­ <lb/>
            tunities for the development of any latent disposition ; and every man <lb/>
            has a point or two in which he is open to the insidious attacks of <lb/>
            opportunity. In matters political, the main thing is to know, from the <lb/>
            indications that a man gives when he has not power, what he will <lb/>
            be when he has power: in the ordinary intercourse of life, the main <lb/>
            tiling is to judge of the character of those with whom we deal by com­ <lb/>
            pulsion or choice, to know how far we can trust what they say, how <lb/>
            far their future conduct may be predicted from present indications. <lb/>
            But to show what these indications are, belongs, as Plutarch says, to <lb/>
            another inquiry than the present. The general rule of old was Distrust, <lb/>
            which the crafty Sicilian, as Cicero (Ad Attic, i. 19) calls Epicharmus, <lb/>
            was always whispering in his ear. Epicharmus has well expressed his <lb/>
            maxim in a single line : </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_75_fig1.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> Wakeful be thou and distrustful: sinews these are to the mind. <lb/>
              This is the rule for the timid, and for them a safe one. But he who It <lb/>
              always suspicious must not expect to be trusted himself; and when <lb/>
              the bold command, he must be content to obey. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="373"/>
              fortune really produces an alteration and change in a <lb/>
              man's natural disposition, or whether, when he gets to <lb/>
              power, his bad qualities hitherto concealed are merely <lb/>
              unveiled, is a matter that belongs to another subject than <lb/>
              the present.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Sulla now began to make blood flow, and he <lb/>
            filled the city with deaths without number or limit; <lb/>
            many persons were murdered on grounds of private <lb/>
            enmity, who had never had anything to do with Sulla, <lb/>
            but he consented to their death to please his adherents. <lb/>
            At last a young man, Caius Metellus, had the boldness to <lb/>
            ask Sulla in the Senate-house, when there would be an <lb/>
            end to these miseries, and how far he would proceed <lb/>
            before they could hope to see them stop. “ We are not <lb/>
            deprecating," he said, “ your vengeance against those <lb/>
            whom you have determined to put out of the way, but we <lb/>
            entreat you to relieve from uncertainty those whom you <lb/>
            have determined to spare." Sulla replied, that he had <lb/>
            not yet determined whom he would spare. "Tell us <lb/>
            then," said Metellus, "whom you intend to punish." <lb/>
            Bulla said that he would. Some say that it was not <lb/>
            Metellus, but Afidius,* one of Sulla's flatterers, who made <lb/>
            use of the last expression. Bulla immediately proscribed <lb/>
            eighty persons without communicating with any magis­ <lb/>
            trate. As this caused a general murmur, he let one day <lb/>
            pass, and then proscribed two hundred and twenty more, <lb/>
            and again on the third day as many. In an harangue to <lb/>
            the people, he said, with reference to these measures, that <lb/>
            he had proscribed all he could think of, and as to those <lb/>
            who now escaped his memory, he would proscribe them <lb/>
            at some future time. It was part of the proscription † <note type="footnote"> * This is not a Roman name. The nearest name to it is Aufldius. <lb/>
            But it is conjectured that one Funditis is meant here (see the note of <lb/>
            Sintenis), and also in the Life of Sertorius (c. 26, 27). This is pro­ <lb/>
            bably the Fufidius (Florus, iii. 21, where the name is written incor­ <lb/>
            rectly Furfidiud in some editions) who said, that “ Some should be left <lb/>
            alive that there might be persons to domineer over." </note><note type="footnote"> t A Proscriptio was a notice set up in some public place. This <lb/>
            Proscription of Sulla was the first instance of the kind, but it was re­ <lb/>
            peated at a later time. The first list of the proscribed, according to <lb/>
            Appian (Civil Wars, i, 55), contained forty senators and about sixte en <lb/>
            hundred equites. Sulla prefaced his proscription by an address to the </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            that every man who received and protected a proscribed <lb/>
            person should be put to death for his humanity; and <lb/>
            there was no exception for brothers, children, or parents. <lb/>
            The reward for killing a proscribed person was two <lb/>
            talents, whether it was a slave who killed his master or a <lb/>
            son who killed his father. But what was considered most <lb/>
            unjust of all, he affixed infamy on the sons and grandsons <lb/>
            of the proscribed and confiscated their property. The <lb/>
            proscriptions were not confined to Rome; they extended <lb/>
            to every city of Italy: neither temple nor hospitable <lb/>
            hearth nor father's house was free from murder, but <lb/>
            husbands were butchered in the arms of their wives, and <lb/>
            children in the embrace of their mothers. The number <lb/>
            of those who were massacred through revenge and hatred <lb/>
            was nothing compared with those who were murdered <lb/>
            for their property. It occurred even to the assassins to <lb/>
            observe that the ruin of such a one was due to his large <lb/>
            house, another man owed his death to his orchard, and <lb/>
            another again to his warm baths. Quintus Aurelius, a <note type="footnote">people, in which he promised to mend their condition. Paterculus <lb/>
            (ii. 28) states that the proscription was to the following effect :-That <lb/>
            the property of the proscribed should be sold, that their children should <lb/>
            be deprived of all title to their property, and should be ineligible to <lb/>
            public offices; and further, that the sons of Senators should bear the <lb/>
            burdens incident to their order and lose all their rights. This wiil <lb/>
            explain the word Infamy, which is used a little below. Infamia among <lb/>
            the Romans was not a punishment, but it was a consequence of con­ <lb/>
            viction for certain offences; and this consequence was a civil disability; <lb/>
            the person who became Infamis lost his vote, an d was ineligible to <lb/>
            the great public offices. He also sustained some disabilities in his <lb/>
            private rights. Sulla therefore put the children of the proscribed in the <lb/>
            same condition as if they had been found guilty of certain offences. </note><note type="footnote"> The consequence of these measures of Bulla was a great change of <lb/>
            property all through Italy. Cities which had favoured the opposite <lb/>
            faction were punished by the loss of their fortifications and heavy <lb/>
            requisitions, such as the French army in the Revolutionary wars levied <lb/>
            in Italy. Sulla settled the s ldiers of twenty three legions in the <lb/>
            It ilian towns as so many garrisons, end, and he gave them lands and houses <lb/>
            by taking them from their owners. These were th e men who stuck to <lb/>
            Sulla while he lived, and attempted to maintain his acts after his <lb/>
            death, for their title could only be defended by supporting his <lb/>
            measures. These are "the men of Sulla," as Cicero sometimes calls <lb/>
            theIn, whose lands were purchased by murder, and who, as he says <lb/>
            (Contra Rullum, ii. 26) were in such odium that their title could not <lb/>
            have stood a single attack of a true and courageous tribune. </note> <lb/>

            man who never meddled with public affairs, and though <lb/>
            he was no further concerned about all these calamities <lb/>
            except so far as he sympathised with the sufferings of <lb/>
            others, happened to come to the Forum and there he rea <lb/>
            the names of the proscribed. Finding his own name <lb/>
            among them, he exclaimed, Alas ! wretch that I am; 'tis <lb/>
            my farm at Alba that is my persecutor. He had not gone <lb/>
            far before he was murdered by some one who was in <lb/>
            search of him.</p>
          <p>XXXII. In the mean time Marius killed himself to <lb/>
            avoid being taken. Sulla now went to Præneste,* and he <lb/>
            began by examining the case of each individual before <lb/>
            he punished him ; but having no time for this inquiry, <lb/>
            he had all the people brought to one spot, to the number <lb/>
            of twelve thousand, and ordered them to be massacred, <lb/>
            with the exception of one man, an old friend of his, <lb/>
            whom he offered to pardon. But the man nobly de­ <lb/>
            clared he would never owe his safety to the destroyer of <lb/>
            his country, and mingling with the rest of the citizens he <lb/>
            was cut down together with them. The affair of Lucius <lb/>
            Catilina t was perhaps the most monstrous of all. Lucius <lb/>
            had murdered his brother before the termination of the <lb/>
            war, and he asked Sulla to proscribe him among the rest as <lb/>
            if he were still alive; which was done. To show his <lb/>
            gratitude, Catilina killed one Marcus Marius, ‡ who <lb/>
            belonged to the opposite faction, and after bringing his <lb/>
            head to Sulla, who was then sitting in the Forum, he <lb/>
            went to the temple of Apollo, which was close by, and <lb/>
            washed his hands in the sacred font.§ <note type="footnote"> * Appian (Civil Wars. i. 94) states that Sulfa made all the people <lb/>

            The rest he divided into three bodies, Romans, Samnites, and <lb/>
            Prænestines: he told the Romans that they deserved to die, but he <lb/>

          <p>XXXIII. Besides the massacres, there were other things <lb/>
            to cause dissatisfaction. Sulla had himself proclaimed <lb/>
            Dictator,. and thus revived this office after an interval of <lb/>
            one hundred and twenty years. An act of indemnity was <lb/>
            also passed for all that he had done; for the future it was <lb/>
            enacted that he should have power of life and death, and <lb/>
            should confiscate property, distribute lands, found colonies, <lb/>
            destroy them, take away kingdoms and give them to whom <lb/>
            he pleased. The sales of confiscated property were con­ <lb/>
            ducted by him from his tribunal in such an arrogant and <lb/>
            tyrannical manner, that his mode of dealing with the <lb/>
            produce of the sales was more intolerable than the seizure <lb/>
            of the property : he gave away to handsome women, <lb/>
            players on the lyre, mimi and worthless libertini, the <lb/>
            lands of whole nations and the revenues of cities ; to some <lb/>
            men he gave wives, who were compelled to marry against <lb/>
            their will. Wishing to form an alliance with Pompeius <lb/>
            Magnus, he made him put away his wife; and he took <lb/>
            ,Emilia, who was the daughter of Scaurus and of his own <lb/>
            wife Metella, from her husband Manius Glabrio,t though <lb/>
            she was then with child, and married her to Pompeius. <lb/>
            Æmilia died in the house of Pompeius in childbirth. <lb/>
            Lucretius 0 fella, t who had taken Præneste, became a <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch's expression is “ he proclaimed himself Dictator," but <lb/>
            this expression is not to be taken literally, nor is it to be supposed <lb/>
            that Plutarch meant it to be taken literally. Sulla was appointed in <lb/>
            proper form, though he did in fact usurp the power, and under the <lb/>
            title of dictator was more than king. (Appian, Civil Wars, i. 98.) <lb/>
            The terms of Sulla's election were that he should hold the office as <lb/>
            long as he pleased ; the disgrace of this compulsory election was veiled <lb/>
            under the declaration that Sulla was appointed to draw up legislative <lb/>
            measures and to settle affairs. Pateroulus (ii. 28) mentions the 120 <lb/>
            years as having elapsed since the time of a previous dictatorship, <lb/>
            which was the year alter Hannibal left Italy B.c. 202. As Sulla was <lb/>
            elected Dictator in B.C. 81, Plutarch's statement is correct. (On the <lb/>
            functions of the Dictator see Life of Cæsar, c. 37.) </note><note type="footnote"> t Manius Acilius Glabrio, who was prætor B.C. 70 during the pro­ <lb/>

            omitted. After saying to the people that Lucretius had been put to <lb/>
            death by his order, Sulla told them a tale: The lieu were very </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            candidate for the consulship, and canvassed for it. Sulla <lb/>
            at first attempted to stop him ; but on Lucretius entering <lb/>
            the Forum supported by a large party, Sulla sent one of <lb/>
            his centurions to kill Lucretius, himself the while sitting <lb/>
            on his tribunal in the temple of Castor and Pollux, and <lb/>
            looking down upon the murder. The bystanders seized <lb/>
            the centurion and brought him before the tribunal; but <lb/>
            Sulla bidding them stop their noise, declared that he had <lb/>
            ordered the centurion to kill Lucretius, and they must let <lb/>
            him go.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. The triumph - of Sulla was magnificent for <lb/>
            the splendour and rarity of the regal spoils; but the exiles <lb/>
            formed a greater ornament to it and a noble spectacle. <lb/>
            The most illustrious and wealthy of the citizens followed <lb/>
            in the procession with chaplets on their heads, calling Bulla <lb/>
            their saviour and father, inasmuch as through him they <lb/>
            were restored to their country, their children, and their <lb/>
            wives. When the triumph was over, Bulla before the <lb/>
            assembled people gave an account of all the events of his <lb/>
            life, mentioning with equal particularity his good fortune <lb/>
            and his great deeds, and in conclusion he bade them salute <lb/>
            him by the name of Eutyches,t for this is the nearest word <lb/>
            to express the Latin Felix : and when he wrote to Greeks <lb/>
            or had any business to transact with them, he called him­ <lb/>
            self Epaphroditus. In our country also, on the trophies <lb/>
            of Sulla, there is the inscription: Lucius Cornelius Bulla <lb/>
            Epaphroditus. As Metella bore him twins, Sulla named <note type="footnote"> troublesome to a clown, as he was ploughing. Twice he stopped his <lb/>
            ploughing and purged his jacket. But he was still bitten, and in <lb/>
            order that he might not be hindered in his work, he burnt the <lb/>
            jacket; and I advise those who have been twice humbled not to make <lb/>
            fire necessary the third time." </note><note type="footnote"> * Plinius (H. N. 33, o. 5) speaks of this triumph: it lasted two days. <lb/>
            In the first day Bulla exhibited in the procession 15,000 pounds <lb/>
            weight of gold and 115,000 pounds of silver, the produce of his <lb/>
            foreign victories: on the second, 13,000 pounds weight of gold and <lb/>
            6000 pounds of silver which the younger Marius had carried off to <lb/>
            Præneste after the conflagration of the Capitol and from the robbery <lb/>
            of the other Roman temples. </note><note type="footnote"> t The term Felix appears on the coins of gulls. Epaphroditus <lb/>

            the male Faustus, and the female Fausta: for the Romans <lb/>
            apply the name Faustus to what is fortunate and gladsome. <lb/>
            Sulla indeed trusted so far to his good fortune rather than <lb/>
            to his acts, that, though he had put many persons to death, <lb/>
            and had made so many innovations and changes in the <lb/>
            state, he laid down the dictatorship,* and allowed the <lb/>
            people to have the full control of the consular elections, <lb/>
            without going near them, and all the while walking <lb/>
            about in the Forum, and exposing himself to any one who <lb/>
            might choose to call him to account, just like a private <lb/>
            person. Contrary to Sulla's wish, a bold man, and an <lb/>
            enemy of his, was likely to be elected consul, Marcus <note type="footnote"> * Sulla abdicated the dictatorship B.C. 79 in the consulship of <lb/>
            P. Servilius Vitia Isauricus and Appius Claudius Pulcher. Appian <lb/>
            (Civil Wars, i. 103, &amp;c.) speaks of the abdication. He made no <lb/>
            attempt to secuie to his family the power that he had acquired. It <lb/>
            may be that he had no desire to perpetuate the power in his family; <lb/>
            and it is certain that this could not have been accomplished. Sulla <lb/>
            had only one son, and he was now a child. But it is certainly a <lb/>
            striking trait in this man'is character that he descended to a private <lb/>
            station from the possession of unlimited power, and after, as Appian <lb/>
            observes, having caused the death of more than one hundred <lb/>
            thousand men in his Italian wars, besides ninety senators, fifteen <lb/>
            consuls, and two thousand six hundred equites, not to mention those <lb/>
            who were banished and whose property was confiscated, and the many <lb/>
            Italian cities whose fortifications he had destroyed and whose lands <lb/>
            and privileges he had taken away. Sulla's character was a compound <lb/>
            of arrogance, self-confidence, and contempt of all mankind, which have <lb/>
            seldom been united. But his ruling character was love of sensual <lb/>
            pleasures. He was weary of his life of turmoil, and he returned to <lb/>
            his property in the neighbourhood of Cum on the pleasant shore of <lb/>
            Campania, where he spent his time on the sea, in fishing, and in <lb/>
            sensual enjoyments. But he had nothing to fear; there were in Italy <lb/>
            one hundred and twenty thousand men who had served under him, to <lb/>
            whom he had given money and land; there was a great number of <lb/>
            persons at Rome who had shared in his cruelties and the profits of <lb/>
            them, and whose safety consisted in maintaining the safety of their <lb/>
            leader. Besides this, he had manumitted above ten thousand vigorous <lb/>
            men, once the slaves of masters who had been murdered by his orders, <lb/>
            and made them Roman citizens under the name of Cornelii. These <lb/>
            men were always in readiness to execute his orders. With these <lb/>
            precautions, this blood-stained man retired to enjoy the sensual grati­ <lb/>
            fications that he had indulged in from his youth upwards, glorying <lb/>
            in his happy fortune and despising all mankind. No attempt to <lb/>
            assassinate him is recorded, nor any apprehension of his on that score. <lb/>
            He lived and died Sulla the Fortunate. </note> <lb/>

            Lepidus,* not for his own merits, but because the people <lb/>
            wished to please Pompeius, who was earnest in his support <lb/>
            and canvassed for him. Sulla seeing Pompeius going <lb/>
            home well pleased with his victory, called him to him and <lb/>
            said: What a fine piece of policy is this of yours, young <lb/>
            man, for Lepidus to be proclaimed consul before Catulus, <lb/>
            the most violent in preference to the most honourable of <lb/>
            men It is, however, time for you not to be asleep, as you <lb/>
            have strengi honed your rival against yourself. Sulla said <lb/>
            this in a kind of prophetic tone, for Lepidus soon broke <lb/>
            out in great excesses, and was at war with Pompeius.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Bulla made an offering of the tenth part of his <lb/>
            substance to Hercules, and feasted the people magnifi­ <lb/>
            cently : so much greater indeed was the preparation than <lb/>
            what was required, that a great quantity of provisions <lb/>
            was daily thrown into the river, and wine was drunk forty <lb/>
            years old, and even older. In the midst of the entertain­ <lb/>
            ment, which lasted several days, Metella died. As the <lb/>
            priests would not allow Sulla to go to her, or his house to <lb/>
            be polluted by a dead body, Sulla sent Metella a writing <lb/>
            of divorce, and ordered her, while still alive, to be removed <lb/>
            from his house to another. So far he observed the custom <lb/>
            strictly through superstition; but the Jaw which limited <lb/>
            the cost of funerals, though he had proposed it himself, he <lb/>
            violated by sparing no expense. He also violated his own <lb/>
            laws for diminishing the cost of entertainments, endea­ <lb/>
            vouring to forget his grief in extravagant drinking and <note type="footnote"> * M. Æmilius Lepidus and Q. Lutatius Oatulus were consuls B.C. 78, <lb/>
            the year of Sulla's death. Lepidus attempted to overthrow Sulla's con­ <lb/>
            stitution after Sulla's death. He was driven from Rome by Q. Catulus <lb/>
            and On. Pompeius Maguus, and died BC. 77 in Sardinia. This Lepidus <lb/>
            was the father of M. Lepidus the associate of Cæsar Octavianus and <lb/>
            M. Antonius in the triumvirate. (See the Life of M. Antonius.) <lb/>
            Catulus was the son of Lutatius Catulus who was once the colleague <lb/>
            of C. Marius in the consulship. He has received great praise from <lb/>
            Cicero. Sallustius calls him a defender of the aristocratical party, and <lb/>
            C. Licinius Macer, as quoted by Sallustius in his History, says that he <lb/>
            was more cruel than Sulla. We cannot trust Cicero's unqualified praise <lb/>
            of this aristocrat nor the censure of Sallustius. What would Cicero's <lb/>
            character be, if we had it from some one who belonged to the party of <lb/>
            Catiline? and what is it as we know it from his own writing? Insin­ <lb/>
            cere, changing with the times, timid, revengeful, and, when he was <lb/>

            feasting, and in the company of buffoons. A few months <lb/>
            after his wife's death there was a show of gladiators. As <lb/>
            there was yet no distinction of places,. but men and <lb/>
            women sat promiscuously in the theatre, it chanced that a <lb/>
            woman seated herself near Bulla who was very handsome <lb/>
            and of good family; she was a daughter of Messala, and <lb/>
            sister of the orator Hortensius: her name was Valeria,t <lb/>
            and she had latelp separated from her husband. This <lb/>
            woman, going behind Sulla, placed her hand upon him, <lb/>
            and pulling a thread out of his dress, returned to her <lb/>
            place. As Sulla looked on her with some surprise, she <lb/>
            said, No mischief, Imperator; ‡ I also wish to have a bit <lb/>
            of your good fortune. Sulla was not displeased at her <lb/>
            words, and it was soon plain that he had conceived a <lb/>
            passion for the woman; for he privately sent to ask her <lb/>
            name, and made himself acquainted with her family and <lb/>
            her mode of life. After this there were interchanges of <lb/>
            glances, and frequent side-looks, and giving and return­ <lb/>
            ing of smiles, and, finally, treaties and arrangements about <lb/>
            marriage, all which on her part perhaps deserved no <lb/>
            censure; but as to Bulla, however chaste and reputable <lb/>
            the woman might be that he married, it was no reputable <lb/>
            or decent matter that induced him to it, for he was caught <lb/>
            like a young man by mere looks and wanton airs, the <lb/>
            nature of which is to excite the most depraved and impure <lb/>
            feelings.</p>

            to conceal it. By this mode of life he aggravated his <lb/>
            disease, which was slight in its origin, and for some time <lb/>
            he was not aware that all his viscera were full of diseased <lb/>

            (See the Argument of P. Manutius, nd the Essay of Unterholzner in <lb/>
            Savigny's Zeitschrift, &amp;c. i. p. 248.) Roscius is called Comœdus in the <lb/>
            title of Cicero's oration and by Plutarch, but he seems to have acted <lb/>
            tragedy also, as we may collect from some passages in Cicero. The <lb/>
            general name at Rome for an actor was histrio; but the histrio is also <lb/>
            contrasted by Cicero (Pro Q. Roscio, c. 10) with the comœdus, as the <lb/>
            inferior compared with the higher professor of the art. Yet Roscius is <lb/>
            sometimes called a histrio. Roscius was a perfect master of his art, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to Cicero; and his name became proverbial among the Romans <lb/>
            to express a perfect master of any art. (Cicero, De Oratore, i 28.) <lb/>
            Cicero was intimate with Roscius, and learned much from him that was <lb/>
            useful to him as an orator. Roscius wrote a work in which he compared <lb/>
            oratory and acting. His professional gains were immense; and he <lb/>
            had a sharp eye after his own intere t, as the speech of Cicero shows. </note><note type="footnote"> t The original is <foreign xml:lang="grc">λυσιω̜δός</foreign>, which is explained by Aristoxenus, <lb/>

            do. Appian merely speaks of his dying of fever. Zachariæ (Life of <lb/>

            tion of Sulla's enemies, and probably of the Athenians whom he had <lb/>
            handled so cruelly. This disease, called Morbus Pediculosus or <lb/>
            Pthiriasis, is not unknown in modem times. Plutarch has collected <lb/>
            instances from ancient times. Akastus belongs to the mythic period. <lb/>
            Alkman lived in the seventh century B.C.: fragments of his poetry <lb/>

            true philosophy, and begin again when philosophy goes to sleep, as <lb/>
            we see in the speculations of the present day. Kallisthenes is mentioned <lb/>

            was got rid of was nothing compared with what came, for <lb/>
            all his clothes, and the bath and the water, and his food, <lb/>
            were filled with the matter that flowed from him, and <lb/>
            with the vermin ; such was the violence of the disorder. <lb/>
            Though he went into the water several times a day and <lb/>
            drenched his body and cleansed it from filth, it was of <lb/>
            no avail, for the disease went on too quickly, and the <lb/>
            quantity of vermin defied all attempts to clear it away. <lb/>
            Among those in very remote times who are said to have <lb/>
            died of the lousy disease was Akastus the son of Pelias ; <lb/>
            and in more recent times, Alkman the lyric poet, Phere­ <lb/>
            kydes the theologian, Kallisthenes of Olynthus, while he <lb/>
            was in prison, and Mucius the lawyer. And if one may <lb/>
            mention those who have got a name, not for any good <lb/>
            that they did, but in other ways, Eunus the runaway <lb/>
            slave, who began the Servile war in Sicily, is said to have <lb/>
            died of this disease, after he was captured and carried to <lb/>
            Rome.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Bulla foresaw his end, and even in a manner <lb/>
            wrote about it, for he finished the twenty-second book of <lb/>
            his Memoirs only two days before his death. He there <lb/>
            says, that the Chaldæans foretold him that it was his fate <lb/>
            to die, after a happy life, at the very height of his pro­ <lb/>
            sperity ; he says also that his son, who had died a short time <lb/>
            before Metella, appeared to him in a dream, in a mean <lb/>
            dress, and standing by him, entreated his father to rest <lb/>
            from his troubles and to go with him to join his mother <lb/>
            Metella, and live with her in ease and quiet. Yet he did <lb/>
            not give up attending to public matters. Ten days before <lb/>
            his death he restored tranquillity among the people of <lb/>
            Dicæarchia,* who were in a state of civil commotion, and <note type="footnote"> a charge of conspiring against Alexander. This Mucius the lawyer <lb/>

            he drew up for them a constitution; and only one day <lb/>

            Upon this his strength failed him and he got through the <lb/>
            night with difficulty. He left two infant children by <lb/>
            Metella; Valeria, after his death, brought forth a daughter, <lb/>
            whom they called Postuma,* for this is the name that the <lb/>

            death.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Now many flocked to Lepidus and combined <lb/>
            with him to prevent the body of Sulla from receiving the <note type="footnote"> colonia. Plutarch simply says that Granius "owed a public debt." <lb/>
            Valerius Maximus (ix. 3) states that Granius was a Princeps of Puteoli <lb/>
            and was slow in getting in the money which had been promised by <lb/>
            the Decuriones of Puteoli towards the rebuilding of the Capitol. Sulla <lb/>
            had said that nothing remained to complete his good fortune, except <lb/>
            to see the Capitol dedicated. No wonder that the delay of Granius <lb/>
            irritated such a man. </note><note type="footnote"> * The Roman words Postumus, Postuma, seem to have been generally <lb/>
            used to signify a child born after the father's death. But they also <lb/>

            simply means “ last." We use the expression “ Posthumous child;" <lb/>
            but the meaning of the word is often misunderstood. (On the effect <lb/>

            in name and estimation; if indeed, the historian wisely adds, a man <lb/>
            should think it good fortune to have obtained all his wishes. </note><note type="footnote"> Sulla had the following children :—Cornelia, by Ilia; she married <lb/>
            Q. Pompeius Rufus who was murdered B.O. 88, and she may have died <lb/>

            Plutarch has said. before his father: Faustus Cornelius Sulla and <lb/>
            Fausta Cornelia, the twin children by Metella, who were both young <lb/>
            when their father died. Faustus lost his life in Africa, when he was <lb/>
            fighting on the Pompeian side. Fausta's first husband was C. Mem­ <lb/>

            by threats, had the body conveyed to Rome, and secured <lb/>
            it a safe and honourable interment. It is said that the <lb/>
            women contributed so great a quantity of aromatics for <lb/>
            Sulla's funeral, t that without including what was con­ <note type="footnote">* It was considered a mark of intentional disrespect or of disappro­ <lb/>
            bation, when a Roman made no mention of his nearest kin or friends in <lb/>
            his will; and in certain cases, the person who was passed over could <lb/>
            by legal process vindicate the imputation thus thrown on h m. (See <lb/>
            the article " Tt stamentum;” in Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities, <lb/>
            under the head "Querela Inofficiosi.”) Sulla did not like Cn. <lb/>
            Pompeius. The only reason for keeping on terms with him was that <lb/>
            he saw his talents and so wished to ally him to his family. For the <lb/>
            same reason Sulla wished to put C. Julius Cæsar to death (Cæsar, 1): <lb/>
            be predicted that he would be the ruin of the aristocratical party. <lb/>
            Sulla made his friend Lucius Lucullus the guardian of his children and <lb/>
            intrusted him with the final correction of his Memoirs. (See the Life <lb/>
            of Lucullus, c. 1). </note><note type="footnote"> t The description of the funeral in Appian (Civil Wars, i. 105, <lb/>
            &amp;c.) is a striking picture. Sulla was buried with more than regal <lb/>
            pomp. </note><note type="footnote"> Plutarch's Life of Sulla has been spoken of as not one of his best <lb/>
            performances. But so far as concerns Plutarch's object in writing <lb/>
            these Lives, which was to exhibit character, it is as good as any of his <lb/>
            Lives, and it has great merit. Whether his anecdotes are always <lb/>
            authentic is a difficult matter to determine. Bulla had many enemies, <lb/>
            and it is probable that his character in private life has been made <lb/>
            worse than it was. The acts of his public life are well ascertained. <lb/>
            Plutarch has nearly omitted all mention of him as a Reformer of the <lb/>
            Roman Constitution and as a Legislator. Sulla's enactments were not <lb/>
            like the imperial constitutions of a later day, the mere act of one who <lb/>
            held the sovereign power: they were laws (leges) duly passed by the <lb/>
            popular assembly. Yet they were Sulla's work, and the legislative <lb/>
            body merely gave them the formal sanction. The object of Sulla's <lb/>
            constitutional measures was to give an aristocratical character to the <lb/>
            Roman constitution, to restore it to something of its pristine state, and <lb/>
            to weaken the popular party by curtailing the power of the tribunes. <lb/>
            The whole subject has often been treated, but at the greatest length by <lb/>
            Zachariæ, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, &amp;c., Heidelberg, 1834. Zachariæ has <lb/>
            drawn the character of Sulla in an apologetical tone. I think the <lb/>
            character of Bulla is drawn better by Plutarch, and that he has repre­ <lb/>
            sented him as near to the life as a biographer can do. Whatever <lb/>
            discrepancies there may be between Plutarch and other authorities, <lb/>
            whatever Plutarch may have omitted which other authorities give, still <lb/>
            be has shown us enough to justify his delineation of the most promi­ </note> <lb/>

            veyed in two hundred and ten litters, there was enough to <lb/>
            make a large figure of Sulla, and also to make a lictor <lb/>
            out of costly frankincense and cinnamon. The day was <lb/>
            cloudy in the morning, and as rain was expected they did <lb/>
            not bring the body out till the ninth hour. However, a <lb/>
            strong wind came down on the funeral pile and raised a <lb/>
            great flame, and they had just time to collect the ashes as <lb/>
            the pile was sinking and the fire going out, when a heavy <lb/>
            rain poured down and lasted till night; so Sulla's good <lb/>
            fortune seemed to follow him to his funeral, and to stay <lb/>
            with him to the last. His monument is in the Campus <lb/>
            Martius. The inscription, which they say he wrote and <lb/>
            left behind him, says in substance, that none of his friends <lb/>

            a survey of Sulla's legislation is necessary. Sulla was an educated <lb/>
            man: he was not a mere soldier like Marius; he was not only a <lb/>
            general; he was a man of letters, a lover of the arts, a keen discri­ <lb/>

            modelled and reformed the whole criminal law of the Romans. His <lb/>
            constitutional measures were not permanent, but it may truly be said <lb/>
            that he prepared the way for the temporary usurpation of Cæsar and <lb/>
            the permanent establishment of the Roman State under Augustus. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">COMPARISON OF LYSANDER AND SULLA</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Now that we have completed the second of these men's <lb/>
            lives, let us proceed to compare them with one another. <lb/>
            Both rose to greatness by their own exertions, though it <lb/>
            was the peculiar glory of Lysander that all his commands <lb/>
            were bestowed upon him by his countrymen of their own <lb/>
            free will and by their deliberate choice, and that he never <lb/>
            opposed their wishes or acted in opposition to the laws of <lb/>
            his country. Now,­ <lb/>
            "In revolutions, villains rise to fame," <lb/>
            and at Rome, at the period of which we are treating, the <lb/>
            people were utterly corrupt and degraded, and frequently <lb/>
            changed their masters. We need not wonder at Sulla's <lb/>
            becoming supreme in Rome when such men as Glaucia <lb/>
            and Saturninus drove the Metelli into exile, when the <lb/>
            sons of consuls were butchered in the senate-house, when <lb/>
            silver and gold purchased soldiers and arms, and laws <lb/>
            were enacted by men who silenced their opponents by fire <lb/>
            and the sword. I cannot blame a man who rises to power <lb/>
            at such a time as this, but I cannot regard it as any proof <lb/>
            of his being the best man in the state, if the state itself <lb/>
            be in such a condition of disorder. Now Lysander was <lb/>
            sent out to undertake the most important commands at a <lb/>
            time when Sparta was well and orderly governed; and <lb/>
            proved himself the greatest of all the foremost men of his <lb/>
            age, the best man of the best regulated state. For this <lb/>
            reason Lysander, though he often laid down his office, was <lb/>
            always re-elected by his countrymen, for the renown of <lb/>
            his abilities naturally pointed him out as the attest man <lb/>
            to command: whereas Sulla, after being once elected to <lb/>
            les 1 an army, remained the chief man in Rome for ten <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>

            dictator, but always remaining a mere military despot.</p>
          <p>II. We have related an attempt of Lysander to subvert <lb/>
            the constitution of Sparta; but he proceeded by a much <lb/>
            more moderate and law-abiding means than Sulla, for he <lb/>
            meant to gain his point by persuasion, not by armed force; <lb/>
            and besides this he did not intend to destroy the constitu­ <lb/>
            tion utterly, but merely to reform the succession to the <lb/>
            throne. And it does not seem contrary to justice, that he <lb/>
            who is best among his peers should govern a city, which <lb/>
            ruled in Greece by virtue, not by nobility of blood.</p>
          <p>A huntsman tries to obtain a good hound, and a horse­ <lb/>
            man a good horse, but does not trouble himself with their <lb/>
            offspring, for the offspring of his horse might turn out to <lb/>
            be a mule. Just so in politics, the important point is, <lb/>
            what sort of man a ruler is, not from what family he is <lb/>
            descended. Even the Spartans in some cases dethroned <lb/>
            their kings, because they were not king-like but worthless <lb/>
            men. If then vice be disgraceful even in the nobly born, <lb/>
            it follows that virtue does not depend upon birth, but is <lb/>
            honoured for itself.</p>
          <p>The crimes of Lysander were committed for, those of <lb/>
            Sulla against, his friends. Indeed, what Lysander did <lb/>
            wrong was done chiefly on behalf of his friends, as, in <lb/>
            order to establish them securely in their various despotic <lb/>
            governments, he caused many of their political opponents <lb/>
            to be pat to death. Sulla, on the other hand, reduced the <lb/>
            army of Pompeius and the fleet which he himself had <lb/>
            given to Dolabella to command, merely to gratify his <lb/>
            private spite. When Lucretius Ofella sued for the consul­ <lb/>
            ship as the reward of many great exploits, he ordered him <lb/>
            to be put to death before his face, and thus made all men <lb/>
            fear and hate him by his barbarous treatment of his most <lb/>
            intimate friends.</p>
          <p>III. Their several esteem for pleasure and for riches <lb/>
            prove still more clearly that Lysander was born to com­ <lb/>
            mand men; Sulla to tyrannize over them. The former, <lb/>
            although he rose to such an unparalleled height of power <lb/>
            never was betrayed by it into any acts of insolent caprice, <lb/>
            and there never was a man to whom the well-known proverb <note type="footnote">“Lions at home but foxes in the field,” </note><note type="footnote">2c2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            was less applicable, Bulla, on the other hand, did not <lb/>
            allow his poverty when young or his years when old to <lb/>
            hinder him in the pursuit of pleasure, but he enacted laws <lb/>
            to regulate the marriages and morals of his countrymen, <lb/>
            and indulged his own amorous propensities in spite of <lb/>
            them, as we read in Sallust's history. In consequence of <lb/>
            his vices, Rome was so drained of money that he was <lb/>
            driven to the expedient of allowing the allied cities to <lb/>
            purchase their independence by payment, and that, too, <lb/>
            although he was daily proscribing the richest men and <lb/>
            selling their property by public auction. Yet he wasted <lb/>
            money without limit upon his courtiers. What bounds <lb/>
            can we imagine he would set to his generosity when in <lb/>
            his cups, seeing that once, when a great estate was being <lb/>
            sold by public auction, he ordered the auctioneer to knock <lb/>
            it down to a friend of his own for a mere nominal sum, <lb/>
            and when some one else made a higher bid, and the <lb/>
            auctioneer called out the additional sum offered, Bulla <lb/>
            flew into a passion and exclaimed: " My friends, I am <lb/>
            very hardly used if I may not dispose of my own plunder <lb/>
            as I please." Now Lysander sent home to his country­ <lb/>
            men even what he had himself received as presents to­ <lb/>
            gether with the rest of the spoils. Yet I do not approve <lb/>
            of him for so doing: for he did as much harm to Sparta <lb/>
            by bestowing that money upon it as Sulla did harm to <lb/>
            Rome by the money which he took from it: but I mention <lb/>
            it as proving how little he cared for money. Each acted <lb/>
            strangely towards his fellow-countrymen. Sulla regu­ <lb/>
            lated and improved the morals of Rome, although he <lb/>
            himself was wasteful and licentious. Lysander filled his <lb/>
            countrymen with the passions from which he himself was <lb/>
            free. Thus the former was worse than the laws which he <lb/>
            himself enacted, while the latter rendered his countrymen <lb/>
            worse than himself, as he taught the Spartans to covet <lb/>
            what he had learned to despise. So much for their politi­ <lb/>
            cal conduct.</p>
          <p>IV. In warlike exploits, in brilliancy of generalship, <lb/>
            in the number of victories he won, and the greatness of <lb/>
            the dangers which he encountered, Bulla is immeasurably <lb/>
            the greater. Lysander did indeed twice conquer in a sea- <lb/>
            fight, and I will even allow him the credit of having <lb/>
             <pb n="389"/>
            taken Athens ; no difficult matter, no doubt, but one which <lb/>
            brought him great glory because of its being so famous a <lb/>
            city. In Boeotia and before Haliartus he was perhaps un­ <lb/>
            lucky, yet his conduct in not waiting for the arrival of <lb/>
            the great force under Pausanias, which was at Plataea, <lb/>
            close by, seems like bad generalship. He would not stay <lb/>
            till the main body arrived, but rashly assaulted the city, <lb/>
            and fell by an unknown hand in an insignificant skir­ <lb/>
            mish. He did not meet his death facing overwhelming <lb/>
            odds, like Kleombrotus at Leuktra, nor yet in the act of <lb/>
            rallying his broken forces, or of consummating his victory, <lb/>
            as did Cyrus and Epameinondas. All these died as became <lb/>
            generals and kings; but Lysander ingloriously flung <lb/>
            away his life like any common light infantry soldier, and <lb/>
            proved the wisdom of the ancient Spartans, who always <lb/>
            avoided the attack of fortified places, where the bravest <lb/>
            may fall by the hand of the most worthless man, or even <lb/>
            by that of a woman or a child, as Achilles is said to have <lb/>
            been slain by Paris at the gates of Troy. Turning now <lb/>
            to bulla, it is not easy to enumerate all the pitched battles <lb/>
            he won, the thousands of enemies that he overthrew. He <lb/>
            twice took Rome itself by storm, and at Athens he took <lb/>
            Peiraeus, not by famine like Lysander, but after a gigan­ <lb/>
            tic struggle, at the end of which he drove Archelaus into <lb/>
            the sea.</p>
          <p>It is important also to consider who were the generals <lb/>
            to whom they were opposed. It must have been mere <lb/>
            child's-play to Lysander to defeat Antiochus, the pilot of <lb/>
            Alkibiades, and to outwit Philokles, the Athenian mob­ <lb/>
            orator, <lb/>
            “ A knave, whose tongue was sharper than his sword," <lb/>
            for they were both of them men whom Mithri dates would <lb/>
            not have thought a match for one of his grooms, or Marius <lb/>
            for one of his lictors. Not to mention the rest of the <lb/>
            potentates, consuls, prætors and tribunes with whom <lb/>
            Sulla had to contend, what Roman was more to be dreaded <lb/>
            than Marius? What king more powerful than Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates ? Who was there in Italy more warlike than Lam­ <lb/>
            ponius and Pontius Telesinus? Yet Sulla drove Marius <lb/>
            into exile, crushed the power of Mithridates, and put <lb/>
            Lamponius and Pontius to death.</p><pb n="390"/>
            
          <p>V. What, however, to my mind incontestably proved <lb/>
            Bulla to have been the greater man of the two, is that, <lb/>
            whereas Lysander was always loyally assisted by his <lb/>
            countrymen in all his enterprises, Sulla, during his cam­ <lb/>
            paign in Boeotia, was a mere exile. His enemies were all­ <lb/>
            powerful at Rome. They had driven his wife to seek <lb/>
            safety in flight, had pulled down his house, and mur­ <lb/>
            dered his friends. Yet he fought in his country's cause <lb/>
            against overwhelming numbers, and gained the victory. <lb/>
            Afterwards, when Mithridates offered to join him and <lb/>
            furnish him with the means of overcoming his private <lb/>
            enemies, he showed no sign of weakness, and would not <lb/>
            even speak to him or give him his hand until he heard <lb/>
            him solemnly renounce all claim to Asia Minor, engage to <lb/>
            deliver up his fleet, and to restore Bithynia and Cappa­ <lb/>
            docia to their native sovereigns. Never did Sulla act in <lb/>
            a more noble and high-minded manner. He preferred his <lb/>
            country's good to his own private advantage, and, like a <lb/>
            well-bred hound, never relaxed his hold till his enemy <lb/>
            gave in, and then began to turn his attention to redress­ <lb/>
            ing his own private wrongs.</p>
          <p>Perhaps their treatment of Athens gives us some insight <lb/>
            into their respective characters. Although that city sided <lb/>
            with Mithridates and fought to maintain his empire, yet <lb/>
            when Sulla had taken it he made it free and independent. <lb/>
            Lysander, on the other hand, felt no pity for Athens when <lb/>
            she fell from her glorious position as the leading state in <lb/>
            Greece, but put an end to her free constitution and esta­ <lb/>
            blished the cruel and lawless government of the Thirty.</p>
          <p>We may now conclude our review of their respective <lb/>
            lives by observing that while Sulla performed greater <lb/>
            achievements, Lysander committed fewer crimes: and <lb/>
            that while we assign the palm for moderation and self- <lb/>
            denial to the latter, that for courage and generalship <lb/>
            must be bestowed upon the former.</p><pb n="391"/>

          <p>PERIPOLTAS, the soothsayer, after he had brought back <lb/>
            King Opheltas and the people under him to Bœotia, left a <lb/>
            family which remained in high repute for many genera­ <lb/>
            tions, and chiefly settled in Chæronea, which was the first <lb/>
            city which they conquered when they drove out the bar­ <lb/>
            barians. As the men of this race were all brave and war­ <lb/>
            like, they were almost reduced to extinction in the wars <lb/>
            with the Persians, and in later times with the Gauls <lb/>
            during their invasion of Greece, so that there remained <lb/>
            but one male of the family, a youth of the name of Damon, <lb/>
            who was surnamed Peripoltas, and who far surpassed all <lb/>
            the youth of his time in beauty and spirit, although he <lb/>
            was uneducated and harsh-tempered. The commander of <lb/>
            a detachment of Roman soldiers who were quartered <lb/>
            during the winter in Chæronea conceived a criminal <lb/>
            passion for Damon, who was then a mere lad, and as he <lb/>
            could not effect his purpose by fair means it was evident <lb/>
            that he would not hesitate to use force, as our city was <lb/>
            then much decayed, and was despised, being so small and <lb/>
            poor. Damon, alarmed and irritated at the man's be­ <lb/>
            haviour, formed a conspiracy with a few young men of <lb/>
            his own age, not many, for secrecy's sake, but consisting <lb/>
            of sixteen in all. These men smeared their faces with <lb/>
            soot, excited themselves by strong drink, and assaulted <lb/>
            the Roman officer just at daybreak, while he was offer­ <lb/>
            ing sacrifice in the market-place. They killed him and <lb/>
            several of his attendants, and then made their escape out <lb/>
            of the city. During the confusion which followed, the <lb/>
            senate of the city of Chæronea assembled and condemned <lb/>
            the conspirators to death-a decree which was intended <lb/>
            to excuse the city to the Romans for what had happened. <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            But that evening, when the chief magistrates, as is their <lb/>
            custom, were dining together, Damon and his party broke <lb/>
            into the senate-house, murdered them all, and again <lb/>
            escaped out of the city. It chanced that at this time <lb/>
            Lucius Lucullus was passing near Chæronea with an <lb/>
            armed force. He halted his troops, and, after investigating <lb/>
            the circumstances, declared that the city was not to blame, <lb/>
            but had been the injured party. As for Damon, who was <lb/>
            living by brigandage and plunder of the country, and who <lb/>
            threatened to attack the city itself, the citizens sent an <lb/>
            embassy to him, and passed a decree guaranteeing his <lb/>
            safety if he would return. When he returned they ap­ <lb/>
            pointed him president of the gymnasium, and afterwards, <lb/>
            while he was being anointed in the public baths, they <lb/>
            murdered him there.</p>
          <p>Our ancestors tell us that as ghosts used to appear in <lb/>
            that place, and groans were heard there, the doors of the <lb/>
            bath-room were built up; and even at the present day those <lb/>
            who live near the spot imagine that shadowy forms are <lb/>
            to be seen, and confused cries heard. Those of his family <lb/>
            who survive (for there are some descendants of Damon) <lb/>
            live chiefly in Phokis, near the city of Steiris. They call <lb/>
            themselves Asbolomeni, which in the Æolian dialect means <lb/>
            "sooty-faced," in memory of Damon having smeared his <lb/>
            face with soot when he committed his crimes.</p>
          <p>II. Now the city of Orchomenus, which is next to that <lb/>
            of Chæronea, was at variance with it, and hired a Roman <lb/>
            informer, who indicted the city for the murder of those <lb/>
            persons killed by Damon, just as if it were a man. The <lb/>
            trial was appointed to take place before the praetor of <lb/>
            Macedonia, for at that time the Romans did not appoint <lb/>
            praetors of Greece. When in court the representatives of <lb/>
            Chæronea appealed to Lucullus to testify to their innocence, <lb/>
            and he, when applied to by the praetor, wrote a letter <lb/>
            telling the entire truth of the story, which obtained an <lb/>
            acquittal for the people of Chæronea. Thus narrowly did <lb/>
            the city escape utter destruction. The citizens showed <lb/>
            their gratitude to Lucullus by erecting a marble statue to <lb/>
            him in the market-place, beside that of Dionysus; and <lb/>
            although I live at a much later period, yet I think it my <lb/>
            duty to show my gratitude to him also, as I too have <lb/>
             <pb n="393"/>
            benefited by his intercession. I intend therefore to <lb/>
            describe his achievements in my Parallel Lives, and thus <lb/>
            raise a much more glorious monument to his memory by <lb/>
            describing his real disposition and character, than any <lb/>
            statue can be, which merely records his faece and form. <lb/>
            It will be sufficient for me if I show that his memory is <lb/>
            held in grateful remembrance, for he himself would be the <lb/>
            first to refuse to be rewarded for the true testimony which <lb/>
            he bore to us by a fictitious narrative of his exploits. We <lb/>
            think it right that portrait painters when engaged in <lb/>
            painting a handsome face should neither omit nor ex­ <lb/>
            aggerate its defects; for the former method wonld destroy <lb/>
            the likeness and the latter the beauty of the picture. <lb/>
            In like manner, as it is hard, or rather impossible, to find <lb/>
            a man whose life is entirely free from blame, it becomes <lb/>
            our duty to relate their noble actions with minute exacti­ <lb/>
            tude, regarding them as illustrative of true character, <lb/>
            whilst, whenever either a man's personal feelings or <lb/>
            political exigencies may have led him to commit mistakes <lb/>
            and crimes, we must regard his conduct more as a tem­ <lb/>
            porary lapse from virtue than as disclosing any innate <lb/>
            wickedness of disposition, and we must not dwell with <lb/>
            needless emphasis on his failings, if only to save our <lb/>
            common human nature from the reproach of being unable <lb/>
            to produce a man of unalloyed goodness and virtue.</p>
          <p>III. It appears to me that the life of Lucullus furnishes a <lb/>
            good parallel to that of Kimon. Both were soldiers, and <lb/>
            distinguished themselves against the barbarians; both <lb/>
            were moderate politicians and afforded their country­ <lb/>
            men a brief period of repose from the violence of party <lb/>
            strife, and both of them won famous victories. No Greek <lb/>
            before Kimon, and no Roman before Lucullus, waged war <lb/>
            at such a distance from home, if we except the legends of <lb/>
            Herakles and Dionysus, and the vague accounts which <lb/>
            we have received by tradition of the travels and exploits <lb/>
            of Perseus in Ethiopia, Media, and Armenia, and of the <lb/>
            expedition of Jason to recover the Golden Fleece.</p>
          <p>Another point in which they agree is the incomplete <lb/>
            nature of the success which they obtained, for they both <lb/>
            inflicted severe losses on their enemies, but neither co n- <lb/>
            pletely crushed them. Moreover we find in each of them <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            the same generous hospitality, and the same luxurious <lb/>
            splendour of living. Their other points of resemblance <lb/>
            the reader may easily discover for himself by a comparison <lb/>
            of their respective lives.</p>
          <p>IV. Kimon was the son of Miltiades by his wife <lb/>
            Hegasipyle, a lady of Thracian descent, being the <lb/>
            daughter of King Olorus, as we learn from the poems <lb/>
            addressed to Kimon himself by Archelaus and Melan­ <lb/>
            thins. Thucydides the historian also was connected with <lb/>
            Kimon's family, as the name of Olorus had descended to <lb/>
            his father,. who also inherited gold mines in Thrace from <lb/>
            his ancestors there. Thucydides is said to have died at <lb/>
            Skapte Hyle, a small town in Thrace, near the gold mines <lb/>
            His remains were conveyed to Athens and deposited in the <lb/>
            cemetery belonging to the family of Kimon, where his <lb/>
            tomb is now to be seen, next to that of Elpinike, Kimon's <lb/>
            sister. However, Thucydides belonged to the township <lb/>
            of Halimus, and the family of Miltiades to that of Lakia.</p>
          <p>Miltiades was condemned by the Athenians to pay a <lb/>
            fine of fifty talents, and being unable to do so, died in <lb/>
            prison, leaving Kimon and his sister Elpinike, who were <lb/>
            then quite young children. Kimon passed the earlier part <lb/>
            of his life in obscurity, and was not regarded favourably <lb/>
            by the Athenians, who thought that he was disorderly <lb/>
            and given to wine, and altogether resembled his grand­ <lb/>
            father Kimon, who was called Koalemus because of his <lb/>
            stupidity.</p>
          <p>Stesimbrotus of Thasos, who was a contemporary of <lb/>
            Kimon, tells us that he never was taught music or any of <lb/>
            the other usual accomplishments of a Greek gentleman, <lb/>
            and that he had none of the smartness and readiness of <lb/>
            speech so common at Athens, but that he was of a noble, <lb/>
            truthful nature, and more like a Dorian of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesus than an Athenian, <lb/>
            “ Rough, unpretending, but a friend in need," <lb/>
            as Euripides says of Herakles, which line we may well <note type="footnote"> * In Greece, where there were no permanent family names, it was <lb/>
            'qual for a family to repeat the same name in alternate generations. <lb/>
            Thus we find that the kings of Cyrene were named alternately Battus <lb/>
            and Archelaus for eight generations, and many other examples might <lb/>
            be quoted. </note> <pb n="395"/>
             <unclear/><lb/>
            apply to Kimon according to the account of him given by <lb/>
            Stesimbrotus. While he was still young he was accused <lb/>
            of incest with his sister. Indeed Elpinike is not recorded <lb/>
            as having been a respectable woman in other respects, as <lb/>
            she carried on an intrigue with Polygnotus the painter; <lb/>
            and therefore it is said that when he painted the colonnade <lb/>
            which was then called the Poisianakteum, which is now <lb/>
            called the Painted Porch, he introduced the portrait of <lb/>
            Elpinike as Laodike, one of the Trojan ladies. Poly­ <lb/>
            gnotus was a man of noble birth, and he did not execute <lb/>
            his paintings for money, but gratis, from his wish to do <lb/>
            honour to his city. This we learn from the historians <lb/>
            and from the poet Melanthius, who wrote— <lb/>
            “ With deeds of heroes old, <lb/>
            He made our city gay, <lb/>
            In market-place and porch, <lb/>
            Himself the cost did pay.” <lb/>
            Some historians tell us that Elpinike was openly married <lb/>
            to Kimon and lived as his wife, because she was too poor to <lb/>
            obtain a husband worthy of her noble birth, but that at <lb/>
            length Kallias, one of the richest men in Athens, fell in <lb/>
            love with her, and offered to pay off the fine which had <lb/>
            been imposed upon her father, by which means he won <lb/>
            her consent, and Kimon gave her away to Kallias as his <lb/>
            wife. Kimon indeed seems to have been of an amorous <lb/>
            temperament, for Asterie, a lady of Salamis, and one <lb/>
            Mnestra are mentioned by the poet Melanthius, in some <lb/>
            playful verses he wrote upon Kimon, as being beloved by <lb/>
            him; and we know that he was passionately fond of Iso­ <lb/>
            dike, the daughter of Euryptolemus the son of Megakles, <lb/>
            who was his lawful wife, and that he was terribly afflicted <lb/>
            by her death, to judge by the elegiac poem which was <lb/>
            written to console him, of which Panætius the philosopher <lb/>
            very reasonably conjectures Archelaus to have been the <lb/>
            author.</p>
          <p>V. All the rest that we know of Kimon is to his honour. <lb/>
            He was as brave as Miltiades, as clever as Themistokles, <lb/>
            and more straightforward than either. Nor was he in­ <lb/>
            ferior to either of them in military skill, while he far <lb/>
            surpassed them in political sagacity, even when he was <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            quite a young man, and without any experience of war. <lb/>
            For instance, when Themistokles, at the time of the <lb/>
            Persian invasion, urged the Athenians to abandon their <lb/>
            city and territory, and resist the enemy at Salamis, on <lb/>
            board of their fleet, while the greater part of the citizens <lb/>
            were struck with astonishment at so daring a proposal, <lb/>
            Kimon was seen with a cheerful countenance walking <lb/>
            through the Kerameikus with his friends, carrying in his <lb/>
            hand his horse's bridle, which he was going to offer up to <lb/>
            the goddess Athena in the Acropolis, in token that at that <lb/>
            crisis the city did not need horsemen so much as sailors. <lb/>
            He hung up the bridle as a votive offering in the temple, <lb/>
            and, taking down one of the shields which hung there, <lb/>
            walked with it down towards the sea, thereby causing <lb/>
            many of his countrymen to take courage and recover their <lb/>
            spirits. He was not an ill-looking man, as Ion the poet' <lb/>
            says, but tall, and with a thick curly head of hair. As he <lb/>
            proved himself a brave man in action he quickly became <lb/>
            popular and renowned in Athens, and many flocked round <lb/>
            him, urging him to emulate the glories won by his father <lb/>
            at Marathon. The people gladly welcomed him on his <lb/>
            first entrance into political life, for they were weary of <lb/>
            Themistokles, and were well pleased to bestow the highest <lb/>
            honours in the state upon one whose simple and unaffected <lb/>
            goodness of heart had made him a universal favourite. <lb/>
            He was greatly indebted for his success to the support <lb/>
            given him by Aristeides, who early perceived his good <lb/>
            qualities, and endeavoured to set him up as an opponent <lb/>
            to the rash projects and crooked policy of Themistokles.</p>
          <p>VI. When, after the repulse of the Persian invasion, <lb/>
            Kimon was sent as general of the Athenian forces to <lb/>
            operate against the enemy in Asia, acting under the orders <lb/>
            of Pausanias, as the Athenians had not then acquit ed their <lb/>
            supremacy at sea, the troops whom he commanded were <lb/>
            distinguished by the splendour of their dress and arms, <lb/>
            and the exactness of their discipline. Pausanias at this <lb/>
            time was carrying on a treasonable correspondence with <lb/>
            the king of Persia, and treated the allied Greek troops <lb/>
            with harshness and wanton insolence, the offspring of <lb/>
            unlimited power. Kimon, on the other hand, punished <lb/>
            offenders leniently, treated all alike with kindness and <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            condescension, and became in all but name the chief of the <lb/>
            Greek forces in Asia, a position which he gained, not by <lb/>
            force of arms, but by amiability of character. Most of the <lb/>
            allies transferred their allegiance to Kimon and Aristeides, <lb/>
            through disgust at the cruelty and arrogance of Pausanias. <lb/>
            There is a tradition that Pausanias when at Byzantium <lb/>
            became enamoured of Kleonike, the daughter of one of the <lb/>
            leading citizens there. He demanded that she should be <lb/>
            brought to his chamber, and her wretched parents dared <lb/>
            not disobey the tyrant's order. From feelings of modesty <lb/>
            Kleonike entreated the attendants at the door of his bed­ <lb/>
            chamber to extinguish all the lights, and she then silently <lb/>
            in the darkness approached the bed where Pausanias lay <lb/>
            asleep. But she stumbled and overset the lamp.- He, <lb/>
            awakened by the noise, snatched up his dagger, and <lb/>
            imagining that some enemy was coming to assassinate him, <lb/>
            stabbed the girl with it, wounding her mortally. It is said <lb/>
            that after this her spirit would never let Pausanias rest, <lb/>
            but nightly appeared to him, angrily reciting the verse— <lb/>
            “ Go, meet thy doom; pride leadeth men to sin."</p>
          <p>The conduct of Pausanias in this matter so enraged the <lb/>
            allied Greeks that, under Kimon's command, they besieged <lb/>
            him in Byzantium, which they took by assault. He, how­ <lb/>
            ever, escaped, and, it is said, fled for refuge to the oracle of <lb/>
            the dead at Heraklea, where he called up the soul of Kleo- <lb/>
            Dike and besought her to pardon him. She appeared, and <lb/>
            told him that if he went to Sparta he would soon be <lb/>
            relieved of all his troubles, an enigmatical sentence <lb/>
            alluding, it is supposed, to his approaching death there.</p>
          <p>VII. Kimon, who was now commander-in-chief, sailed <lb/>
            to Thrace, as he heard that the Persians, led by certain <lb/>
            nobles nearly related to Xerxes Limself, had captured the <lb/>
            city of Eion on the river Strymon, and were making war <lb/>
            upon the neighbouring Greek cities. His first act on <lb/>
            landing was to defeat the Persians, and shut them up in <lb/>
            the city. H e next drove away the Thracian tribes beyond <lb/>
            the Strymon, who supplied the garrison with provisions, <lb/>
            and by carefully watching the country round he reduced <note type="footnote"> * The Greek lamp was movable, and used to be set upon a tall <lb/>
            slender lamp-stand or candel. brum. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            the city to such straits that Boutes, the Persian general <lb/>
            perceiving that escape was impossible, set it on fire, and <lb/>
            himself with his friends and property perished in the <lb/>
            flames. When Kimon took the city he found nothing in <lb/>
            it of any value, as everything had been destroyed in <lb/>
            the fire together with the Persian garrison; but as the <lb/>
            country was beautiful and fertile, he made it an Athenian <lb/>
            colony. Three stone statues of Hermes at Athens were <lb/>
            now set up by a decree of the people, on the first of which <lb/>
            is written :­ <lb/>
            “Brave men were they, who, by the Strymen fair, <lb/>
            First taught the haughty Persians to despair;" <lb/>
            and on the second­ <lb/>
            “ Their mighty chiefs to thank and praise, <lb/>
            The Athenians do these columns raise; <lb/>
            That generations yet to come, <lb/>
            May fight as well for hearth and home;" <lb/>
            and on the third­ <lb/>
            “ Mnestheus from Athena led onr hosts of yore, <lb/>
            With Agamemnon, to the Trojan shore; <lb/>
            Than whom no chief knew better to array, <lb/>
            The mail-clad Greeks, when mustering for the fray: <lb/>
            Thus Homer sung; and Athens now, as then, <lb/>
            Doth bear away the palm for ruling men."</p>
          <p>VIII. These verses, although Kimon's name is nowhere <lb/>
            mentioned in them, appeared to the men of that time ex­ <lb/>
            cessively adulatory. Neither Themistokles nor Miltiades <lb/>
            had ever been so honoured. When Miltiades demanded <lb/>
            the honour of an olive crown, Sophanes of Dekeleia rose <lb/>
            up in the public assembly and said,—“Miltiades, when <lb/>
            you have fought and conquered the barbarians alone, you <lb/>
            may ask to be honoured alone, but not before "— a harsh <lb/>
            speech, but one which perfectly expressed the feeling of <lb/>
            the people.</p>
          <p>Why, then, were the Athenians so charmed with Kimon's <lb/>
            exploit? The reason probably was because their other <lb/>
            commanders had merely defended them from attack, while <lb/>
            under him they had been able themselves to attack the <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            enemy, und had moreover won territory near Eion, and <lb/>
            founded the colony of Amphipolis. Kimon also led a <lb/>
            colony to Skyros, which island was taken by Kimon on <lb/>
            the following pretext.</p>
          <p>The original inhabitants were Dolopes,* who were bad <lb/>
            farmers, and lived chiefly by piracy. Emboldened by <lb/>
            success they even began to plunder the strangers who <lb/>
            came into their ports, and at last robbed and imprisoned <lb/>
            some Thessalian merchants whose ships were anchored at <lb/>
            Ktesium. The merchants escaped from prison, and laid a <lb/>
            complaint against the people of Skyros before the Am­ <lb/>
            phiktyonic council. The people refused to pay the fine <lb/>
            imposed by the council, and said that it ought to be paid <lb/>
            by those alone who had shared the plunder. These men, <lb/>
            in terror for their ill-gotten gains, at once opened a corre­ <lb/>
            spondence with Kimon, and offered to betray the islan 1 <lb/>
            into his hands if he would appear before it with an <lb/>
            Athenian fleet. Thus Kimon was enabled to make him­ <lb/>
            self master of Skyros, where he expelled the Dolopes and <lb/>
            put an end to their piracies; after which, as he learned <lb/>
            that in ancient times the hero Theseus, the son of Ægeus, <lb/>
            after he had been driven out of Athens, took refuge at <lb/>
            Skyros, and was murdered there by Lykomedes, who <lb/>
            feared him, he endeavoured to discover where he was <lb/>
            buried. Indeed there was an oracle which commanded <lb/>
            the Athenians to bring back the bones of Theseus to their <lb/>
            city and pay them fitting honours, but they knew not <lb/>
            where they lay, as the people of Skyros did not admit <lb/>
            that they possessed them, and refused to allow the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians to search for them. Great interest was now mani­ <lb/>
            fested in the search, and after his sepulchre † had with <lb/>
            great difficulty been discovered, Kimon placed the remains <lb/>
            of the hero on board of his own ship and brought them <lb/>
            back to Athens, from which they had been absent four <lb/>
            hundred years. This act made him very popular with the <lb/>
            people of Athens, one mark of which is to be found in <lb/>
            his decision in the case of the rival tragic poets. When <lb/>
            Bophokles produced his first play, being then very young, <note type="footnote"> * A Thessalian tribe. </note><note type="footnote"> t See vol. i.' Life rf Theseus,' oh. XXXVI. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            Aphepsion,* the archon, seeing that party feeling ran high <lb/>
            among the spectators, would not cast lots to decide who <lb/>
            were to be the judges, but when Kimon with the other <lb/>
            nine generals, his colleagues, entered to make the usual <lb/>
            libation to the god, he refused to allow them to depart, <lb/>
            but put them on their oath, and forced them to sit as <lb/>
            judges, they being ten in number, one from each of the <lb/>
            ten tribes. The excitement of the contest was much in­ <lb/>
            creased by the high position of the judges. The prize was <lb/>
            adjudged to Sophokles, and it is said that Æschylus was <lb/>
            so grieved and enraged at his failure that he shortly after­ <lb/>
            wards left Athens and retired to Sicily, where he died, <lb/>
            and was buried near the city of Gela.</p>
          <p>IX. Ion tells us that when quite a boy he came from <lb/>
            Chios to Athens, and met Kimon at supper in the house of <lb/>
            Laomedon. After supper he was asked to sing, and he <lb/>
            sang well. The guests all praised him, and said that he <lb/>
            was a cleverer man than Themistokles; for Themistokles <lb/>
            was wont to say that he did not know how to sing or to <lb/>
            play the harp, but that he knew how to make a state <lb/>
            rich and great. Afterwards the conversation turned upon <lb/>
            Kimon's exploits, and each mentioned what he thought <lb/>
            the most important. Hereupon Kimon himself described <lb/>
            what he considered to be the cleverest thing he had ever <lb/>
            done. After the capture of Sestos and Byzantium by the <lb/>
            Athenians and their allies, there were a great number of <lb/>
            Persians taken prisoners, whom the allies desired Kimon <lb/>
            to divide amongst them. He placed the prisoners on one <lb/>
            side, and all their clothes and jewellery on the other, and <lb/>
            offered the allies their choice between the two. They <lb/>
            complained that he had made an unequal division, but he <lb/>
            bade them take whichever they pleased, assuring them <lb/>
            that the Athenians would willingly take whichever part <lb/>
            they rejected. By the advice of Herophytus of Samos, <lb/>
            who urged them to take the property of the Persians, <lb/>
            rather than the Persians themselves, the allies took the <lb/>
            clothes and jewels. At this Kimon was thought to have <note type="footnote"> * It has been conjectured from certain inscriptions that this name <lb/>
            should be spelt Apsephion. But we know that Aphepsion was a <lb/>
            Greek name, while the other form appears unmeaning. The passage <lb/>
            is quoted in Clinton, ‘ Fasti Hell.,' but both forms are there used </note><lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            made a most ridiculous division of the spoil, as the allies <lb/>
            went swaggering about with gold bracelets, armlets, and <lb/>
            necklaces, dressed in Median rol es of rich purple, while <lb/>
            the Athenians possessed only the naked bodies of men <lb/>
            who were very unfit for labour. Shortly afterwards, how­ <lb/>
            ever, the friends and relations of the captives came down <lb/>
            to the Athenian camp from Phrygia and Lydia, and ran­ <lb/>
            somed each of them for great sums of money, so that <lb/>
            Kimon was able to give his fleet four months’ pay, and also <lb/>
            to remit a large sum to Athens, out of the money paid for <lb/>
            their ransom.</p>
          <p>X. The money which Kimon had honourably gained in <lb/>
            the war he spent yet more honourably upon his country­ <lb/>
            men. He took down the fences round his fields, that both <lb/>
            strangers and needy Athenians might help themselves to <lb/>
            his crops and fruit. He provided daily a plain but plenti­ <lb/>
            ful table, at which any poor Athenian was welcome to <lb/>
            dine, so that he might live at his ease, and be able to <lb/>
            devote all his attention to public matters. Aristotle tells <lb/>
            us that it was not for all the Athenians, but only for the <lb/>
            Lakiadæ, or members of his own township, that he kept <lb/>
            this public table. He used to be attended by young men <lb/>
            dressed in rich cloaks, who, if he met any elderly citizen <lb/>
            poorly clothed, would exchange cloaks with the old man; <lb/>
            and this was thought to be a very noble act. The same <lb/>
            young men carried pockets full of small change and would <lb/>
            silently put money into the hands of the better class of <lb/>
            poor in the market-place. All this is alluded to by <lb/>
            Kratinus, the comic poet, in the following passage from his <lb/>
            play of the Archilochi: <lb/>
            “ I too, Metrobius, hoped to end <lb/>
            My days with him, my noblest friend, <lb/>
            Kimon, of all the Greeks the best, <lb/>
            And, richly feasting, sink to rest. <lb/>
            But now he's gone, and I remain unblest." <lb/>
            Moreover, Gorgias of Leontini says that Kimon acquired <lb/>
            wealth in order to use it, and used it so as to gain honour: <lb/>
            while Kritias, who was one of the Thirty, in his poems <lb/>
            wishes to be <lb/>
            “ Rich as the Skopads, and as Kimon great, <lb/>
            And like Agesilaus fortunate." <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2D </note> <pb n="402"/>
            </p>
          <p>Indeed, Lichas the Spartan became renowned through­ <lb/>
            out Greece for nothing except having entertained all the <lb/>
            strangers who were present at the festival of the Gymno­ <lb/>
            pædia: while the profuse hospitality of Kimon, both to <lb/>
            strangers and his own countrymen, far surpassed even the <lb/>
            old Athenian traditions of the heroes of olden days; for <lb/>
            though the city justly boasts that they taught the rest of <lb/>
            the Greeks to sow corn, to discover springs of water, and <lb/>
            to kindle fire, yet Kimon, by keeping open house for all his <lb/>
            countrymen, and allowing them to share his crops in the <lb/>
            country, and permitting his friends to partake of all the <lb/>
            fruits of the earth with him in their season, seemed really <lb/>
            to have brought back the golden age. If any scurrilous <lb/>
            tongues hinted that it was merely to gain popularity and <lb/>
            to curry favour with the people that. he did these things, <lb/>
            their slanders were silenced at once b yKimon's personal <lb/>
            tastes and habits, which were entirely aristocratic and <lb/>
            Spartan. He joined Aristeides in opposing Themistokles <lb/>
            when the latter courted the mob to an unseemly extent, <lb/>
            opposed Ephialtes when, to please the populace, he dis­ <lb/>
            solved the senate of the Areopagus, and, at a time when <lb/>
            all other men except Aristeides and Ephialtes were gorged <lb/>
            with the plunder of the public treasury, kept his own <lb/>
            hands clean, and always maintained the reputation of an <lb/>
            incorruptible and impartial statesman. It is related that <lb/>
            one Rhuesakes, a Persian, who had revolted from the king, <lb/>
            came to Athens with a large sum of money, and being <lb/>
            much pestered by the mercenary politicians there, took <lb/>
            refuge in the house of Kimon, where he placed two bowls <lb/>
            beside the door-posts, one of which he filled with gold, and <lb/>
            the other with silver darics.* Kimon smiled at this, and <lb/>
            inquired whether he wished him to be his friend, or his <lb/>
            hired agent; and when the Persian answered that he <lb/>
            wished him to be a friend, he said, " Then take this money <lb/>
            away; for if I am your friend I shall be able to ask you for <lb/>
            it when I want it."</p>
          <p>XI. When the allies of Athens, though they continued <lb/>
            to pay their contribution towards the war against Persia, <lb/>
            refused to furnish men and ships for it, and would not <lb/>
            go on military expeditions any longer, because they were <note type="footnote"> * The daric was a Persian coin, named after King Darius. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            tired of war and wished to cultivate their fields and live <lb/>
            in peace, now that the Persians no longer threatened them, <lb/>
            the other Athenian generals endeavoured to force them into <lb/>
            performing their duties, and by taking legal proceedings <lb/>
            against the defaulters and imposing fines upon them, made <lb/>
            the Athenian empire very much disliked. Kimon, on the <lb/>
            other hand, never forced any one to serve, but took an <lb/>
            equivalent in money from those who were unwilling to <lb/>
            serve in person, and took their ships without crews, per­ <lb/>
            mitting them to stay at home and enjoy repose, and by <lb/>
            their luxury and folly convert themselves into farmers <lb/>
            and merchants, losing all their ancient warlike spirit and <lb/>
            skill, while by exercising many of the Athenians in turn <lb/>
            in campaigns and military expeditions, he rendered them <lb/>
            the masters of the allies by means of the very money <lb/>
            which they themselves supplied. The allies very naturally <lb/>
            began to fear and to look up to men who were always at <lb/>
            sea, and accustomed to the use of arms, living as soldiers <lb/>
            on the profits of their own unwarlike leisure, and thus by <lb/>
            degrees, instead of independent allies, they sank into the <lb/>
            position of tributaries and subjects.</p>
          <p>XII. Moreover, no one contributed so powerfully as <lb/>
            Kimon to the humbling of the king of Persia; for Kimon <lb/>
            would not relax his pursuit of him when he retreated from <lb/>
            Greece, but hung on the rear of the barbarian army and <lb/>
            would not allow them any breathing-time for rallying <lb/>
            their forces. He sacked several cities and laid waste their <lb/>
            territory, and induced many others to join the Greeks, so <lb/>
            that he drove the Persians entirely out of Asia Minor, <lb/>
            from Ionia to Pamphylia. Learning that the Persian leaders <lb/>
            with a large army and fleet were lying in wait for him <lb/>
            in Pamphylia, and wishing to rid the seas of them as far <lb/>
            as the Chelidoniæ, or Swallow Islands, he set sail from <lb/>
            Knidus and the Triopian Cape with a fleet of two hundred <lb/>
            triremes, whose crews had been excellently trained to speed <lb/>
            and swiftness of manoeuvring by Themistokles, while he <lb/>
            had himself improved their build by giving them a greater <lb/>
            width and extent of upper deck, so that they might afford <lb/>
            standing-room for a greater number of fighting men. On <lb/>
            reaching the city of Phaselis, as the inhabitants, although <lb/>
            of Greek origin, refused him admittance, and preferred to <note type="footnote">2D2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            remain faithful to Persia, he ravaged their territory and <lb/>
            assaulted the fortifications. However, the Chians who <lb/>
            were serving in Kimon's army, as their city had always <lb/>
            been on friendly terms with the people of Phaselis, con­ <lb/>
            trived to pacify his anger, and by shooting arrows into the <lb/>
            town with letters wrapped round them, conveyed intelli­ <lb/>
            gence of this to the inhabitants. Finally, they agreed to <lb/>
            pay the sum of ten talents, and to join the campaign <lb/>
            against the Persians. We are told by the historian Epho­ <lb/>
            rus that the Persian fleet was commanded by Tithraustes, <lb/>
            and the land army by Pherendates. Kallisthenes, how­ <lb/>
            ever, says that the supreme command was entrusted to <lb/>
            Ariomandes, the son of Gobryas, who kept the fleet idle <lb/>
            near the river Eurymedon, not wishing to risk an engage­ <lb/>
            ment with the Greeks, but waiting for the arrival of a <lb/>
            reinforcement of eighty Phoenician ships from Cyprus. <lb/>
            Kimon, wishing to anticipate this accession of strength, <lb/>
            put to sea, determined to force the enemy to fight. The <lb/>
            Persian fleet at first, to avoid an engagement, retired into <lb/>
            the river Eurymedon, but as the Athenians advanced they <lb/>
            came out again and ranged themselves in order of battle. <lb/>
            Their fleet, according to the historian Phanodemus, con­ <lb/>
            sisted of six hundred ships, but, according to Ephorus, of <lb/>
            three hundred and fifty. Yet this great armament offered <lb/>
            no effective resistance, but turned and fled almost as soon <lb/>
            as the Athenians attacked. Such as were able ran their <lb/>
            ships ashore and took refuge with the land army, which <lb/>
            was drawn up in battle array close by, while the rest were <lb/>
            destroyed, crews and all, by the Athenians. The number <lb/>
            of the Persian ships is proved to have been very great, by <lb/>
            the fact that, although many escaped, and many were <lb/>
            sunk, yet the Athenians captured two hundred prizes.</p>
          <p>XIII. The land forces now moved down to the beach, <lb/>
            and it appeared to Kimon that it would be a hazardous <lb/>
            undertaking to effect a landing, and to lead his tired men <lb/>
            to attack fresh troops, who also had an immense superiority <lb/>
            over them in numbers. Yet as he saw that the Greeks were <lb/>
            excited by their victory, and were eager to join battle <lb/>
            with the Persian army, he disembarked his heavy-armed <lb/>
            troops, who, warm as they were from the sea-fight, raised <lb/>
            a loud shout, and charged the enemy at a run. The <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            Persian army met them front to front, and an obstinate <lb/>
            battle took place, in which many distinguished Athenians <lb/>
            fell. At length the Persians were defeated with great <lb/>
            slaughter, and the Athenians gained an immense booty <lb/>
            from the plunder of the tents and the bodies of the slain.</p>
          <p>Kimon, having thus, like a well-trained athlete at the <lb/>
            games, carried off two victories in one day, surpassing that <lb/>
            of Salamis by sea, and that of Platæa by land, proceeded <lb/>
            to improve his success by attacking the Phoenician ships <lb/>
            also. Hearing that they were at Hydrum, he sailed <lb/>
            thither in haste, before any news had reached the Phoeni­ <lb/>
            cians about the defeat of their main body, so that they <lb/>
            were in anxious suspense, and on the approach of the <lb/>
            Athenians were seized with a sudden panic. All their <lb/>
            ships were destroyed, and nearly all their crews perished <lb/>
            with them. This blow so humbled the pride of the king <lb/>
            of Persia, that he afterwards signed that famous treaty in <lb/>
            which he engaged not to approach nearer to the Greek <lb/>
            seas than a horseman could ride in one day, and not to <lb/>
            allow a single one of his ships of war to appear between <lb/>
            the Kyanean * and Chelidonian Islands. Yet the historian <lb/>
            Kallisthenes tells us that the Persians never made a treaty <lb/>
            to this effect, but that they acted thus in consequence of <lb/>
            the terror which Kimon had inspired by his victory; and <lb/>
            that they removed so far from Greece, that Perikles with <lb/>
            fifty ships, and Ephialtes with only thirty, sailed far <lb/>
            beyond the Chelidonian Islands and never met with any <lb/>
            Persian vessels. However, in the collection of Athenian <lb/>
            decrees made by Kraterus, there is a copy of the articles <lb/>
            of this treaty, which he mentions as though it really <lb/>
            existed. It is said that on this occasion the Athenians <lb/>
            erected an altar to Peace, and paid great honours to <lb/>
            Kallias, who negotiated the treaty. So much money was <lb/>
            raised by the sale of the captives and spoils taken in the <lb/>
            war, that besides what was reserved for other occasions, <lb/>
            the Athenians were able to build the wall on the south <lb/>
            side of the Acropolis from the treasure gained in this <lb/>
            campaign. We are also told that at this time the founda­ <note type="footnote"> * The Kyanean or Black Islands were at the junction of the Bos­ <lb/>
            porus with the Euxine, or Black Sea. The Chelidonian or Swallow <lb/>
            Islands were on the south coast of Lycia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            tions of the Long Walls were laid. These walls, which <lb/>
            were also called the Legs, were finished afterwards, but <lb/>
            the foundations, which had to be carried over marshy <lb/>
            places, were securely laid, the marsh being filled up with <lb/>
            chalk and large stones, entirely at Kimon's expense. He <lb/>
            also was the first to adorn the city with those shady <lb/>
            public walks which shortly afterwards became so popular <lb/>
            with the Athenians, for he planted rows of plane-trees in <lb/>
            the market-place, and transformed the Academy from a <lb/>
            dry and barren wilderness into a well-watered grove, full <lb/>
            of tastefully-kept paths and pleasant walks under the <lb/>
            shade of fine trees.</p>
          <p>XIV. As some of the Persians, despising Kimon, who <lb/>
            had set out from Athens with a very small fleet, refused <lb/>
            to leave the Chersonese, and invited the Thracian tribes of <lb/>
            the interior to assist them in maintaining their position, <lb/>
            he attacked them with four ships only, took thirteen of the <lb/>
            enemy's, drove out the Persians, defeated the Thracian s, <lb/>
            and reconquered the Chersonese for Athens. After this <lb/>
            he defeated in a sea-fight the people of Thasos, who had <lb/>
            revolted from Athens, captured thirty-three of their ships, <lb/>
            took their city by storm, and annexed to Athens the <lb/>
            district of the mainland containing the gold mines, which <lb/>
            had belonged to the Thasians. From Thasos he might <lb/>
            easily have invaded Macedonia and inflicted great damage <lb/>
            upon that country, but he refrained from doing so. In <lb/>
            consequence of this he was accused of having been bribed <lb/>
            by Alexander, the king of Macedonia, and his enemies at <lb/>
            home impeached him on that charge. In his speech in <lb/>
            his own defence he reminded the court that he was the <lb/>
            proxenus,* or resident agent at Athens, not of the rich <lb/>
            Ionians or Thessalians, as some other Athenians were, <lb/>
            with a view to their own profit and influence, but of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, a people whose frugal habits he had <lb/>
            always been eager and proud to imitate; so that he him­ <lb/>
            self cared nothing for wealth, but loved to enrich the state <lb/>
            with money taken from its enemies. During this trial, <note type="footnote"> * The office of proxenus corresponds most nearly to the modern <lb/>
            consul. He was bound to offer hospitality and assistance to any <lb/>
            persons of the state which he represented ; but it must be remembered <lb/>
            that he was always a member of a foreign state. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="407"/>
            Stesimbrotus informs us that Elpinike, Kimon's sister, <lb/>
            came to plead her brothers cause with Perikles, the bitterest <lb/>
            of his opponents, and that Perikles answered with a smile, <lb/>
            “ Elpinike, you are too old to meddle in affairs of this <lb/>
            sort." But for all that, in the trial he treated Kimon far <lb/>
            more gently than any of his other accusers, and spoke <lb/>
            only once, for form's sake.</p>
          <p>XV. Thus was Kimon acquitted; and during the re­ <lb/>
            mainder of his stay in Athens he continued to oppose the <lb/>
            encroachments of the people, who were endeavouring to <lb/>
            make themselves the source of all political power. When, <lb/>
            however, he started again on foreign service, the populace <lb/>
            finally succeeded in overthrowing the old Athenian con­ <lb/>
            stitution, and under the guidance of Ephialtes greatly <lb/>
            curtailed the jurisdiction of the Senate of the Areopagus, <lb/>
            and turned Athens into a pure democracy. At this time <lb/>
            also Perikles was rising to power as a liberal politician. <lb/>
            Kimon, on his return, was disgusted at the degrada­ <lb/>
            tion of the ancient Senate of the Areopagus, and began <lb/>
            to intrigue with a view of restoring the aristocratic <lb/>
            constitution of Kleisthenes. This called down upon <lb/>
            him a storm of abuse from the popular party, who <lb/>
            brought up again the old scandals about his sister, and <lb/>
            charged him with partiality for the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            These imputations are alluded to in the hackneyed lines <lb/>
            of Eupolis: <lb/>
            “Not a villain beyond measure, <lb/>
            Only fond of drink and pleasure; <lb/>
            Oft he slept in Sparta's town, <lb/>
            And left his sister here alone." <lb/>
            If, however, he really was a careless drunkard, and yet <lb/>
            took so many cities and won so many battles, it is clear <lb/>
            that if he had been sober and diligent he would have sur­ <lb/>
            passed the most glorious achievements of any Greek, <lb/>
            either before or since.</p>
          <p>XVI. He was always fond of the Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            named one of his twin sons Lacedæmonius, and the other <lb/>
            Eleius. These children were borne to him by his wife <lb/>
            Kleitoria, according to the historian Stesimbrotus; and <lb/>
            consequently Perikles frequently reproached them with <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            the low birth of their mother. But Diodorus the geo­ <lb/>
            grapher says that these two and the third, Thessalus, <lb/>
            were all the children of Kimon by Isodike, the daughter <lb/>
            of Euryptolemus the son of Megakles. Much of Kimon a <lb/>
            political influence was due to the fact that the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians were bitterly hostile to Themistokles, and wished <lb/>
            to make him, young as he was, into a powerful leader of <lb/>
            the opposite party at Athens. The Athenians at first <lb/>
            viewed his Spartan partialities without dissatisfaction, <lb/>
            especially as they gained considerable advantages by <lb/>
            them; for during the early days of their empire when <lb/>
            they first began to extend and consolidate their power, <lb/>
            they were enabled to do so without rousing the jealousy <lb/>
            of Sparta, in consequence of the popularity of Kimon with <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians. Most international questions were <lb/>
            settled by his means, as he dealt generously with the <lb/>
            subject states, and was viewed with especial favour by <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>Afterwards, when the Athenians became more powerful, <lb/>
            they viewed with dislike Kimon's excessive love for Sparta. <lb/>
            He was never weary of singing the praises of Lacedæmon <lb/>
            to the Athenians, and especially, we are told by Stesim­ <lb/>
            brotus, when he wished to reproach them, or to encourage <lb/>
            them to do better, he used to say, “ That is not how the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians do it." This habit caused many Athen . <lb/>
            ians to regard him with jealousy and dislike: but the <lb/>
            most important ground of accusation against him was the <lb/>
            following. In the fourth year of the reign of king Archi­ <lb/>
            damus, the son of Zeuxidamus, at Sparta, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian territory was visited by the greatest earthquake <lb/>
            ever known there. The earth opened in many places, <lb/>
            some of the crags of Taygetus fell down, and the whole <lb/>
            city was destroyed, with the exception of five houses. It <lb/>
            is related that while the boys and young men were prac­ <lb/>
            tising gymnastics in the palæstra, a hare ran into the <lb/>
            building, and that the boys, naked and anointed as they <lb/>
            were, immediately ran out in pursuit of it, while the <lb/>
            gymnasium shortly afterwards fell upon the young men <lb/>
            who remained and killed them all. Their tomb is at this <lb/>
            day called Seismatia, that is, the tomb of those who <lb/>
            perished in the earthquake.</p><pb n="409"/>
            
          <p>Archidamus, perceiving the great dangers with which <lb/>
            this disaster menaced the state, and observing that the <lb/>
            citizens thought of nothing but saving their most valuable <lb/>
            property from the wreck, ordered the trumpet to sound, <lb/>
            as though the enemy were about to attack, and made every <lb/>
            Spartan get under arms and rally round him as quickly <lb/>
            as possible. This measure saved Sparta; for the helots <lb/>
            had gathered together from the country round about, and <lb/>
            were upon the point of falling upon the survivors. Finding <lb/>
            them armed and drawn up in order, they retreated to the <lb/>
            neighbouring cities, and openly made war against the <lb/>
            Spartans, having won over no small number of the Periœki <lb/>
            to their side, while the Messenians also joined them in <lb/>
            attacking their own old enemies. At this crisis the Spar­ <lb/>
            tans sent Perikleides as an ambassador to Athens to demand <lb/>
            assistance. This is the man whom Aristophanes ridiculed <lb/>
            in his play as sitting by the altars as a suppliant, with a <lb/>
            pale face and a scarlet cloak, begging for an army.</p>
          <p>We are told by Kritias that Ephialtes vigorously <lb/>
            opposed his mission, and besought the Athenians not to <lb/>
            assist in restoring a state which was the rival of Athens, <lb/>
            but to let the pride of Sparta be crushed and trampled in <lb/>
            the dust. Kimon, on the other hand, postponing the <lb/>
            interests of his own country to those of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            persuaded the people of Athens to march a numerous body <lb/>
            of men to assist them. The historian Ion has preserved <lb/>
            the argument which had most effect upon the Athenians, <lb/>
            and says that Kimon besought them not to endure to <lb/>
            see Greece lame of one foot and Athens pulling without <lb/>
            her yoke-fellow.</p>
          <p>XVII. When Kimon with his relieving force marched <lb/>
            to help the Lacedæmonians, he passed through the terri­ <lb/>
            tory of Corinth. Lachartus objected to this, saying that <lb/>
            he had marched in before he had asked leave of the <lb/>
            Corinthians, and reminded him that when men knock at <lb/>
            a door, they do not enter before the master of the house <lb/>
            invites them to come in. Kimon answered, “ Lachartus, <lb/>
            you Corinthians do not knock at the doors of the cities of <lb/>
            Megara or of Kleonæ, but break down the door and force <lb/>
            your way in by the right of the stronger, just as we are <lb/>
            doing now." By this timely show of spirit he silenced <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            the Corinthians, and passed through the territory of Corinth <lb/>
            with his army.</p>
          <p>The Lacedæmonians invited the aid of the Athenians a <lb/>
            second time, to assist in the reduction of the fortress of <lb/>
            Ithomé, which was held by the Messenians and revolted <lb/>
            helots; but when they arrived the Lacedæmonians feared <lb/>
            so brilliant and courageous a force, and sent them back, <lb/>
            accusing them of revolutionary ideas, although they did <lb/>
            not treat any other of their allies in this manner. The <lb/>
            Athenians retired, in great anger at the treatment they <lb/>
            had received, and no longer restrained their hatred of all <lb/>
            who favoured the Lacedæmonians. On some trifling pre­ <lb/>
            text they ostracised Kimon, condemning him to exile for <lb/>
            ten years, which is the appointed time for those suffering <lb/>
            from ostracism. During this time the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            after setting Delphi free from the Phokians, encamped at <lb/>
            Tanagra, and fought a battle there with the Athenians, <lb/>
            who came out to meet them. On this occasion Kimon <lb/>
            appeared, fully armed, and took his place in the ranks <lb/>
            among his fellow-tribesmen. However, the senate of the <lb/>
            five hundred hearing of this, became alarmed, and, as his <lb/>
            enemies declared that his only object was to create confusion <lb/>
            during the battle and so to betray his countrymen to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, they sent orders to the generals, forbidding <lb/>
            them to receive him. Upon this he went away, after <lb/>
            having begged Eutbippus the Anaphlystian and those of <lb/>
            his friends who were especially suspected of Laconian lean­ <lb/>
            ings, to fight bravely, and by their deeds to efface this <lb/>
            suspicion from the minds of their fellow-citizens. They <lb/>
            took Kimon's armour, and set it up in their ranks; and <lb/>
            then, fighting in one body round it with desperate courage, <lb/>
            they all fell, one hundred in number, causing great grief <lb/>
            to the Athenians for their loss, and for the unmerited <lb/>
            accusation which had been brought against them. This <lb/>
            event caused a revulsion of popular feeling in favour of <lb/>
            Kimon, when the Athenians remembered how much they <lb/>
            owed him, and reflected upon the straits to which they <lb/>
            were now reduced, as they had been defeated in a great <lb/>
            battle at Tanagra, and expected that during the summer <lb/>
            Attica would be invaded by the Lacedæmonians. They <lb/>
            now recalled Kimon from exile; and Perikles himself <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            brought forward the decree for his restoration. So mo­ <lb/>
            derate were the party-leaders of that time, and willing to <lb/>
            subordinate their own differences to the common welfare <lb/>
            of their country.</p>
          <p>XVIII. On his return Kimon at once put an end to the <lb/>
            war, and reconciled the two states. After the peace had <lb/>
            been concluded, however, he saw that the Athenians were <lb/>
            unable to remain quiet, but were eager to increase their <lb/>
            empire by foreign conquest. In order, therefore, to prevent <lb/>
            their quarrelling with any other Greek state, or cruising <lb/>
            with a large fleet among the islands and the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            coast, and so becoming entangled in some petty war, he <lb/>
            manned a fleet of two hundred triremes with the intention <lb/>
            of sailing a second time to Cyprus and Egypt, wishing both <lb/>
            to train the Athenians to fight against barbarians, and also <lb/>
            to gain legitimate advantages for Athens by the plunder <lb/>
            of her natural enemies. When all was ready, and the men <lb/>
            were about to embark, Kimon dreamed that he saw an <lb/>
            angry dog barking at him, and that in the midst of its <lb/>
            barking it spoke with a human voice, saying, <lb/>
            “Go, for thou shalt ever be <lb/>
            Loved both by my whelps and me." <lb/>
            This vision was very hard to interpret. Astyphilus of Posei­ <lb/>
            donia, a soothsayer and an intimate friend of Kimon's, told <lb/>
            him that it portended his death, on the following grounds. <lb/>
            The dog is the enemy of the man at whom he barks: now <lb/>
            a man is never so much loved by his enemies as when he <lb/>
            is dead; and the mixture of the voice, being partly that <lb/>
            of a dog and partly that of a man, signifies the Persians, <lb/>
            as their army was composed partly of Greeks and partly <lb/>
            of barbarians. After this dream Kimon sacrificed to <lb/>
            Dionysus. The prophet cut up the victim, and the blood <lb/>
            as it congealed was carried by numbers of ants towards <lb/>
            Kimon, so that his great too was covered with it before he <lb/>
            noticed them. At the moment when Kimon observed this, <lb/>
            the priest came up to him to tell him that the liver of the <lb/>
            victim was defective. However, he could not avoid going <lb/>
            on the expedition, and sailed forthwith. He despatched <lb/>
            sixty of his ships to Egypt, but kept the rest with him. <lb/>
            He conquered the Phoenician fleet in a sea-fight, recovered <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            the cities of Cilicia, and began to meditate an attack upon <lb/>
            those of Egypt, as his object was nothing less than the <lb/>
            utter destruction of the Persian empire, especially when <lb/>
            he learned that Themistokles had risen to great eminence <lb/>
            among the Persians, and had undertaken to command their <lb/>
            army in a campaign against Greece. It is said that one <lb/>
            of the chief reasons which caused Themistokles to despair <lb/>
            of success was his conviction that he could not surpass <lb/>
            the courage and good fortune of Kimon. He therefore <lb/>
            committed suicide, while Kimon, who was now revolving <lb/>
            immense schemes of conquest as he lay at Cyprus with his <lb/>
            fleet, sent an embassy to the shrine of Ammon to ask some­ <lb/>
            thing secret. What it was no one ever knew, for the god <lb/>
            made no response, but as soon as the messengers arrived <lb/>
            bade them return, as Kimon was already with him. On <lb/>
            hearing this, they retraced their steps to the sea, and when <lb/>
            they reached the headquarters of the Greek force, which <lb/>
            was then in Egypt, they heard that Kimon was dead. <lb/>
            On counting back the days to that on which they received <lb/>
            the response, they perceived that the god had alluded <lb/>
            to Kimon's death when he said that he was with him, <lb/>
            meaning that he was among the gods.</p>
          <p>XIX. According to most authorities Kimon died of sick­ <lb/>
            ness during a siege; but some writers say that he died of <lb/>
            a wound which he received in a battle with the Persians. <lb/>
            When dying he ordered his friends to conceal his death, <lb/>
            but at once to embark the army and sail home. This was <lb/>
            effected, and we are told by Phanodemus that no one, either <lb/>
            of the enemy or of the Athenian allies conceived any sus­ <lb/>
            picion that Kimon had ceased to command the forces until <lb/>
            after he had been dead for thirty days. After his death <lb/>
            no great success was won by any Greek general over the <lb/>
            Persians, but they were all incited by their popular ora­ <lb/>
            tors and the war-party to fight with one another, which <lb/>
            led to the great Peloponnesian war. This afforded a long <lb/>
            breathing-time to the Persians, and wrought terrible havoc <lb/>
            with the resources of Greece. Many years afterwards <lb/>
            Agesilaus invaded Asia, and carried on war for a short <lb/>
            time against the Persian commanders who were nearest <lb/>
            the coast. Yet he also effected nothing of any importance, <lb/>
            and being recalled to Greece by the internal troubles of <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            that country, left Persia drawing tribute from all the <lb/>
            Greek cities and friendly districts of the sea-coast, although <lb/>
            in the time of Kimon no Persian tax-gatherer or Persian <lb/>
            horseman was ever seen within a distance of four hundred <lb/>
            stades (fifty miles) from the sea.</p>
          <p>His remains were brought back to Attica, as is proved <lb/>
            by the monument which to this day is known as the <lb/>
            “Tomb of Kimon." The people of Kitium,* also, how­ <lb/>
            ever, pay respect to a tomb, said to be that of Kimon, <lb/>
            according to the tale of the orator Nausikrates, who <lb/>
            informs us that once during a season of pestilence and <lb/>
            scarcity the people of Kitium were ordered by an oracle <lb/>
            not to neglect Kimon, but to pay him honour and respect <lb/>
            him as a superior being. Such a man as this was the <lb/>
            Greek general. <note type="footnote">* A seaport town in Cyprus </note> <pb n="414"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF LUCULLUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. The grandfather of Lucullus * was a man of consul <lb/>
            rank, and his uncle on the mother's side was Metellus,t <lb/>
            surnamed Numidicus. His father was convicted of pecu­ <lb/>
            lation, and his mother, Cæcilia, had a bad name as a <lb/>
            woman of loose habits. Lucullus, while he was still a <lb/>
            youth, before he was a candidate for a magistracy and <lb/>
            engaged in public life, made it his first business to bring <lb/>
            to trial his father's accuser, Servilins the augur, as a <lb/>
            public offender; and the matter appeared to the Romans <lb/>
            to be creditable to Lucullus, and they used to speak of <lb/>
            that trial as a memorable thing. It was, indeed, the <lb/>
            popular notion, that to prefer an accusation was a repu­ <lb/>
            table measure, even when there was no foundation for it, <lb/>
            and they were glad to see the young men fastening on <lb/>
            offenders, like well-bred whelps laying hold of wild beasts. <lb/>
            However, there was much party spirit about that trial, <note type="footnote"> * The complete name of Lucullus was L. Licinius Lucullus. The <lb/>
            Licinii were a Plebeian Gens, to which belonged the Luculli, Crassi, <lb/>
            Murænæ, and others. Lucius Licinius Lucullus, the grandfather of <lb/>
            Plutarch's Lucullus, was the son of L. Licinius Lucullus, who was <lb/>
            curule ædile B.C. 202, and the first who gave nobility to his family. <lb/>
            This grandfather of Lucullus was consul B.C. 151 with P. Postumius <lb/>
            Albinus. He conquered the Vaccæi, Cantabri, and other nations of <lb/>
            Spain, hitherto unknown to the Romans. Appian (Iberica, c. 52) gives <lb/>
            an instance of his cruelty and perfidy in his Spanish wars. L. Licinius <lb/>
            Lucullus, the father, was praetor B.C. 103. In B.C 102 he went to take <lb/>
            the command against the slaves who were in rebellion in Sicily under <lb/>
            Athenion. He conducted the war ill, and on his return he was prose­ <lb/>
            cuted for peculation and convicted. His punishment was exile. It is <lb/>
            not known what the offence was that Servilius was charged with. </note><note type="footnote"> t This Metellus was the conqueror of Jugurtha; he was consul <lb/>
            B.C. 109. See the Life of Marius, c. 7. His sister Cæcilia was the wife <lb/>
            of L. Licinius Lucullus, the father of Plutarch's Lucullus; she was also <lb/>
            the mother of Marcus the brother of Lucius Lucullus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            and some persons were even wounded and killed; but <lb/>
            Servilius was acquitted. Lucullus had been trained to <lb/>
            speak both Latin and Greek competently, so that Sulla, <lb/>
            when he was writing his memoirs,. dedicated them to <lb/>
            Lucullus as a person who would put them together and <lb/>
            arrange his history better than himself; for the style of <lb/>
            the oratory of Lucullus was not merely suited to business <lb/>
            and prompt, like that of the other orators which disturbed <lb/>
            the Forum­ <lb/>
            “As a struck tunny throws about the sea,” t <lb/>
            but when it is out of the Forum is <lb/>
            “Dry, and for want of true discipline half dead”— <lb/>
            but he cultivated the appropriate and so-called liberal <lb/>
            sciences, with a view to self-improvement, from his early <lb/>
            youth. When he was more advanced in years he let his <lb/>
            mind, as it were, after so many troubles, find tranquillity <lb/>
            and repose in philosophy, rousing to activity the con­ <lb/>
            templative portion of his nature, and seasonably termina­ <lb/>
            ting and cutting short his ambitious aspirations after his <lb/>
            difference with Pompeius. Now, as to his love of learning, <lb/>
            this also is reported, in addition to what has been men­ <lb/>
            tioned : when he was a young man, in a conversation with <lb/>
            Hortensius,t the orator, and Sisenna,§ the historian, which <note type="footnote"> * See Life of Bulla, c. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> t This line is also quoted by Plutarch in his Treatise ' De Sera <lb/>

            rival of Cicero, who often speaks of him. He began his career as a <lb/>
            pleader in the courts at the age of nineteen, and continued his practice <lb/>

            war and of the war of Sulla in Italy, which he continued to the death <lb/>
            of Sulla. The historical work of Sallustius began where that of Sisenna <lb/>
            ended. Cicero (De Legg. i. 2) says that Sisenna was the best historical <lb/>
            writer that had then appeared at Rome. He wrote other works also, <lb/>
            and he translated into Latin the lewd stories of Aristides the Milesian <lb/>

            Greek and Roman, he would treat the subject of the <lb/>
            Marsio war in whichsoever of these two languages the lot <lb/>
            should decide; and it seems that the lot resulted in a <lb/>
            Greek history, for there is still extant a Greek history of <lb/>
            the Marsic war by Lucullus.* Of his affection to his <lb/>
            brother Marcus† there were many proofs, but the Romans <lb/>
            speak most of the first; being older than his brother, he <lb/>
            did not choose to hold a magistracy by himself, but he <lb/>
            waited till his brother was of the proper age, and so far <lb/>
            gained the public favour that his brother in his absence <lb/>
            was elected ædile jointly with him.</p>
          <p>II. Though he was a young man during the Marsic <lb/>
            war, he gave many proofs of courage and prude ce; but <lb/>
            it was rather on account of the solidity of his character <lb/>
            and the mildness of his temper that Sulla attached Lucul­ <lb/>
            lus to himself, and from the beginning he constantly em­ <lb/>
            ployed him in affairs of the greatest importance; one of <lb/>
            which was the matter relating to the coinage. It was <lb/>
            Lucullus who superintended the coining of most of the <lb/>
            money in the Peloponnesus during the Mithridatic war, <lb/>
            and it was named Lucullean after him, and continued for a <lb/>
            long time to have a ready circulation, in consequence of <lb/>
            the demands of the war. Afterwards, Sulla, who was in <lb/>
            possession of the country about Athens,‡ but was shut out <lb/>
            from supplies by sea by the enemy, who had the command <lb/>
            of it, sent Lucullus to Egypt and Libya to get ships there. <lb/>
            It was now the depth of winter, but still he set sail with <lb/>
            three Greek piratical ships, and the same number of <lb/>
            Rhodian biremes, exposing himself to a wide sea and to <note type="footnote"> * It appears from this that the History of the Marsic war by Lucullus <lb/>
            was extant in the time of Plutarch. Cicero (.Ad Attic, i. 19) mentions </note><note type="footnote"> this Greek history of Lucullus. <lb/>
            t This Marcus was adopted by M. Terentius Varro, whence after his <lb/>

            hostile vessels, which, owing to their having the supe­ <lb/>
            riority, were cruising about in great numbers and in all <lb/>
            directions. However, he landed at Crete, and made the <lb/>
            people friendly to his cause; and, finding the Cyrenæans <lb/>
            in a state of confusion, owing to continual tyrannies and <lb/>
            wars, he tranquillized and settled the state, by reminding <lb/>
            the citizens of a certain expression of Plato, which the <lb/>
            philosopher had addressed to them in a prophetic spirit. <lb/>
            They asked him, as it appears, to draw up laws for them, <lb/>
            and to settle their democracy after the model of a well­ <lb/>
            ordered polity; but he replied that it was difficult to <lb/>
            legislate for the Cyrenæans while they were so prosperous. <lb/>
            Nothing, indeed, is more difficult to govern than a man <lb/>
            who considers himself prosperous; and, on the other hand, <lb/>
            there is nothing more obedient to command than a man <lb/>
            when he is humbled by fortune. And it was this that <lb/>
            made the Cyrenæans tractable to Lucullus in his legisla­ <lb/>
            tion for them. Sailing from Cyrene * to Egypt, he lost <lb/>
            most of his vessels by an attack of pirates; but he escaped <lb/>
            himself, and entered Alexandria in splendid style; for the <lb/>
            whole fleet came out to meet him, as it was used to do <lb/>
            when a king entered the port, equipped magnificently. <lb/>
            The young king, Ptolemæus,† showed him other surprising <lb/>
            marks of attention, and gave him a lodging and table in <lb/>
            the palace, though no foreign general had ever before <lb/>
            been lodged there. He also offered him an allowance for <note type="footnote"> * Drumann (Geschichte Roms, Licinii Luculli, p. 121, n. 80) observes <lb/>
            that this winter expedition of Lucullus was " not after the capture of <lb/>

            (Mithridat. c. 33). But Plutarch's account is not what Drumann <lb/>
            represents it to be. This expedition was in the winter of B.O. 87 and <lb/>
            86. Aelian (Var. Hist. ii. 42) tells a similar story of Plato and the <lb/>

            his expenditure, not such as he used to offer to others, but <lb/>
            four times as much; Lucullus, however, would not receive <lb/>
            anything more than his necessities required, nor yet any <lb/>
            present, though the king sent presents to the value of <lb/>
            eighty talents. It is said that Lucullus did not go up <lb/>
            to Memphis,* nor make inquiry about any other of the <lb/>
            wondrous and far-famed things in Egypt; he said that <lb/>
            such things befitted an idle spectator, and one who had <lb/>
            only to enjoy himself: not a man like himself, who had <lb/>
            left the Imperator encamped under the bare sky, and close <lb/>
            to the enemy's battlements.</p>
          <p>III. Ptolemæus declined the alliance, being afraid of the <lb/>
            war ; but he gave Lucullus ships to convoy him as far as <lb/>
            Cyprus, and when he was setting sail he embraced him <lb/>
            and paid him great attention, and presented him with <lb/>
            an emerald set in gold, of great price. Lucullus at first <lb/>
            begged to be excused from taking the present; but when <lb/>
            the king showed him that the engraving contained his <lb/>
            royal likeness, Lucullus was afraid to refuse the present, <lb/>
            lest, if he should be supposed to sail away at complete <lb/>
            enmity with the king, he might be plotted against on the <lb/>
            sea. In his voyage along the coast Lucullus got together <lb/>
            a number of vessels from the maritime towns except such <lb/>
            as participated in piratical iniquities, and passed over to <lb/>
            Cyprus, where, hearing that his enemies were lying in <lb/>
            wait for him with their ships at the headlands, he drew <lb/>
            up all his vessels, and wrote to the cities about winter <lb/>
            quarters and supplies, as if he intended to stay there till the <lb/>
            fine season. As soon as a favourable opportunity offered <lb/>
            for his voyage, he launched his ships and got out to sea, <lb/>
            and by sailing during the day with his sails down and low, <lb/>
            and putting them up at night, he got safe to Rhodes. The <lb/>
            Rhodians supplied him with some more ships, and he <lb/>
            persuaded the people of Kos and Knidus to quit the king's <lb/>
            side, and join him in an attack on the Samians. He drove <lb/>
            the king's party also out of Chios, and he gave the people <lb/>
            of Kolophon freedom by seizing Epigonus, their tyrant. <lb/>
            It happened about this time that Mithridates had left <note type="footnote"> *Plutarch is alluding to the Pyramids, and to the great temples of <lb/>
            Memphis. </note> <lb/>

            Pergamum, and was shut up in Pitane.* While Fimbria t <lb/>
            was keeping the king blockaded there on the land side <lb/>
            and pressing the siege, Mithridates, looking to the sea, got <lb/>
            together and summoned to hint ships from every quarter, <lb/>
            having given up all design of engaging and fighting <lb/>
            with Fimbria, who was a bold man and had defeated him. <lb/>
            Fimbria observing this, and being deficient in naval force, <lb/>
            sent to Lucullus, and prayed him to come with his fleet <lb/>
            and help him to take the most detested and the most hostile <lb/>
            of kings, in order that Mithridates, the great prize, which <lb/>
            had been followed through many contests and labours, <lb/>
            might not escape the Romans, now that he had given them <lb/>
            a chance of seizing him, and was caught within the nets. <lb/>
            He said, if Mithridates was taken, no one would have <lb/>
            more of the glory than he who stopped his flight and laid <lb/>
            hold of him when he was trying to steal away; that if <lb/>
            Mithridates were shut out from the land by him, and <lb/>
            excluded from the sea by Lucullus, there would be a victory <lb/>
            for both of them, and that as to the vaunted exploits of <lb/>
            Sulla at Orchomenus and Chæronea,‡ the Romans would <lb/>
            think nothing of them in comparison with this. There <lb/>
            was nothing unreasonable in all that Fimbria said ; and it <lb/>
            was plain to every man that if Lucullus, who was at no <lb/>
            great distance, had then accepted the proposal of Fimbria, <lb/>
            and led his ships there and blockaded the port with his <lb/>
            fleet, the war would have been at an end, and all would <lb/>
            have been delivered from innumerable calamities. But <lb/>
            whether it was that Lucullus regarded his duty to Bulla. <lb/>
            above all private and public interests, or that he detested <lb/>
            Fimbria, who was an abandoned man, and had lately mur­ <lb/>
            dered his own friend and general,§ merely from ambition <lb/>
            to command, or whether it was through chance, as the <lb/>
            Deity would have it, that he spared Mithridates, and re­ <lb/>
            served him for his own antagonist-he would not listen to <note type="footnote"> * Pitane was one of the old Greek towns of Aeolis, situated on the <lb/>

            Fimbria, but allowed Mithridates to escape by sea, and <lb/>
            to mock the force of Fimbria. Lucullus himself, in the <lb/>
            first place, defeated off Lektum in the Troad,* the king's <lb/>
            ships, which showed themselves there, and again observ­ <lb/>
            ing that Neoptolemus was stationed at Tenedos with a <lb/>
            larger force, he sailed against him ahead of all the rest, <lb/>
            in a Rhodian galley of five banks which was commanded <lb/>
            by Demagoras, a man well affected to the Romans, and <lb/>
            exceedingly skilful in naval battles. Neoptolemus came <lb/>
            against him at a great rate, and ordered the helmsman to <lb/>
            steer the ship right against the vessel of Lucullus; but <lb/>
            Demagoras, fearing the weight of the king's vessel and the <lb/>
            rough brass that she was fitted with, did not venture to <lb/>
            engage head to head, but he quickly turned his ship round <lb/>
            and ordered them to row her stern foremost,‡ and the <lb/>
            vessel being thus depressed at the stern received the blow, <lb/>
            which was rendered harmless by falling on those parts of <lb/>
            the ship which were in the water. In the meantime his <lb/>
            friends coining to his aid, Lucullus commanded them to <lb/>
            turn his ship's head to the enemy; and, after performing <lb/>
            many praiseworthy feats, he put the enemy to flight, and <lb/>
            pursued Neoptolemus.</p>
          <p>IV. After this, Lucullus joined Sulla in the Chersonesus, <lb/>
            as he was going to cross the Hellespont, and he made the <lb/>
            passage safe for him, and assisted his army in getting over. <lb/>
            When the treaty was made, and Mithridates had sailed off <lb/>
            to the Euxine, and Sulla had imposed a contribution ‡ of <lb/>
            twenty thousand talents on Asia, and Lucullus had been ap­ <lb/>
            pointed to collect the money, and to strike coin, it appeared <lb/>
            some small consolation to the cities of Asia for the harsh­ <lb/>
            ness of Sulla that Lucullus not only behaved with honesty <lb/>
            and justice, but conducted himself mildly in the discharge <lb/>
            of so oppressive and disagreeable a duty. Though the <note type="footnote"> * Lektum is a promontory of the Tread, which is that district of Asia <lb/>

            Mitylenæans had openly revolted, Lucullus wished them <lb/>
            to come to their senses, and to submit to some reasonable <lb/>
            penalty for their ill-conduct in the matter of Marius;* but <lb/>
            perceiving that they were under the influence of some evil <lb/>
            dæmon, he sailed against them, and defeated them in a <lb/>
            battle, and, after shutting them up in their walls, and <lb/>
            establishing a blockade, he sailed out in open day to Elæa,† <lb/>
            but he returned by stealth, and laying an ambuscade near <lb/>
            the city, kept quiet. The Mitylenaeans approached in dis­ <lb/>
            order, and with confidence in the expectation of plunder­ <lb/>
            ing a deserted camp; but Lucullus falling on them took <lb/>
            a great number alive, and killed five hundred of them <lb/>
            who made resistance. He also took six thousand slaves, and <lb/>
            the rest of the booty was past count. But in the miseries <lb/>
            which Bulla and Marius were at that time bringing on <lb/>
            the people of Italy, without limit and of every kind, he <lb/>
            had no share, being detained by his business in Asia by <lb/>
            some happy fortune. Nevertheless, he had not less favour <lb/>
            with Bulla than the rest of his friends ; for, as I have said <lb/>
            Bulla dedicated his memoirs to Lucullus, as a token of <lb/>
            his affection, and finally he appointed him the guardian of <lb/>
            his son, and passed by Pompeius. And this was probably <lb/>
            the origin of the difference and the jealousy between <lb/>
            Lucullus and Pompeius; for they were both young, and <lb/>
            burning for distinction.</p>
          <p>V. Shortly after Sulla's death, Lucullus was consul t <lb/>
            with Marcus Cotta, about the hundred and seventy-sixth <lb/>
            Olympiad. Many persons were again attempting to stir <lb/>
            up the Mithridatic war, and Marcus said that the war was <lb/>
            not ended, but only stopped for a time. It was for this <lb/>
            reason that Lucullus was annoyed at the lot giving him <lb/>
            for his province Gaul within (south of) the Alps, which <lb/>
            offered no opportunity for great exploits. But the reputa­ <lb/>
            tion of Pompeius, who was now in Iberia, stung him most, <lb/>
            as it was expected that l'ompeius, in preference to any one <note type="footnote"> * It is conjectured by Leopoldus that there is an error here, and that <lb/>
            the name should he Manius,and that Manius Aquilius is meant, whom, <lb/>
            together with others, the Mitylenæans gave up in chains to Mithridates <lb/>
            (Vell. Paterc. ii. 18.) </note><note type="footnote"> t This is a place on the coast of the mainland, and east of Pitane. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Lucullus was consul B.C. 74, with M. Aurelius Cotta for his <lb/>

            else, would be forthwith chosen to the command of the <lb/>
            war against Mithridates, if it should happen that the <lb/>
            Iberian war should be brought to a close. Accordingly, <lb/>
            when Pompeius asked for money,. and wrote to say that if <lb/>
            they did not send it he would leave Iberia and Sertorius, <lb/>
            and lead his troops back to Italy, Lucullus did all he <lb/>
            could to get money sent, and to prevent Pompeius return­ <lb/>
            ing from Iberia on any pretence whatever while he was <lb/>
            consul; for he considered that the whole State would be <lb/>
            at the disposal of Pompeius if he were at Rome with so <lb/>
            large an army. Cethegus,† also, who had then the power <lb/>
            in his hands by always speaking and acting with a view <lb/>
            to popularity, was at enmity with Lucullus, who detested <lb/>
            his habits of life, which were nothing but a course of <lb/>
            unnatural lusts, insolence, and violence. With Cethegus <lb/>
            then Lucullus was at open war. There was, indeed an­ <lb/>
            other demagogue, Lucius Quintius,‡ who had set himself <lb/>
            against Sulla's measures, and attempted to disturb the <lb/>
            present settlement of affairs; but Lucullus, by much per­ <lb/>
            suasion in private and reproof in public, drew him from <lb/>
            his designs, and quieted his ambition, in as politic and <lb/>
            wholesome a way as a man could do, by taking in hand so <lb/>
            great a disease at its commencement.</p>
          <p>VI. In the meantime news arrived of the death of <lb/>
            Octavius,§ the Governor of Cilicia. Now there were many <lb/>
            eager competitors for the province, who courted Cethegus <lb/>
            as the person who was best able to help them to it. As <lb/>
            to Cilicia itself, Lucullus made no great account of that <lb/>
            province; but, inasmuch as he thought, if he should get <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Pompeius, a. 20, and the Life of Sertorius, c. 21. </note><note type="footnote"> t P. Cornelius Cethegus originally belonged to the party of Marius, <lb/>

            means untried to prevent the province falling into other <lb/>
            hands; and, at last, contrary to his natural disposition, <lb/>
            he submitted from necessity to do an act which was not <lb/>
            creditable, or commendable, though it was useful towards <lb/>
            the end he had in view. There was a woman named <lb/>
            Præcia, who was famed through Rome for her beauty and <lb/>
            gallantry, and though in other respects she was no better <lb/>
            than a common prostitute, yet, as she availed herself of <lb/>
            her influence with those who visited her and talked to her, <lb/>
            for the purpose of forwarding the interests and political <lb/>
            views of her friends, she added to her other attractions the <lb/>
            reputation of being a woman who was much attached to <lb/>
            her friends, and very active in accomplishing anything, <lb/>
            and she obtained great influence. Cethegus, who was <lb/>
            then at the height of his popularity, and directed the <lb/>
            administration, was captivated by Præcia, and began to <lb/>
            cohabit with her, and thus the whole power of the State <lb/>
            fell into her hands; for no public measure was transacted <lb/>
            if Cethegus was not for it, and if Præcia did not recom­ <lb/>
            mend it to Cethegus. Now Lucullus gained over Præcia by <lb/>
            presents and flattery; and, indeed, it was in itself a great <lb/>
            boon to a proud woman, fond of public display, to be seen <lb/>
            using her influence on behalf of Lucullus; and thus he <lb/>
            soon had Cethegus speaking in his favour, and trying to <lb/>
            get Cilicia for him. When Lucullus had once gained the <lb/>
            province of Cilicia, it was no longer necessary for him to <lb/>
            call in the aid of Præcia or Cethegus, but all alike readily <lb/>
            put into his hands the conduct of the Mithridatic war, <lb/>
            believing that it could not be managed better by any <lb/>
            other person; for Pompeius was still fighting against <lb/>
            Sertorius, and Metellus * had withdrawn from service by <lb/>
            reason of his age, and these were the only persons who <lb/>
            could be considered as rivals to Lucullus in any dispute <lb/>
            about the command in the war. However, Cotta, the <lb/>
            colleague of Lucullus, after making earnest application <lb/>
            to the Senate, was sent with some ships to watch the <lb/>
            Propontis,t and to defend Bithynia. <note type="footnote"> * Q. Caecilius Metellug Pius. See the Life of Sertorius. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is the closed sea that lies between the two chanrels, by one </note> <pb n="424"/>

          <p>VII. Lucullus, with one legion which he had raised at <lb/>
            home, crossed over into Asia, where he took the command <lb/>
            of the rest of the forces, all of whom had long been spoiled <lb/>
            by luxurious habits and living at free quarters; and the <lb/>
            soldiers of Fimbria were said to have become difficult to <lb/>
            manage, from being accustomed to obey no commander <lb/>
            They were the men who joined Fimbria in putting to <lb/>
            death Flaccus, who was a consul and their general, and <lb/>
            who gave up Fimbria himself to Sulla *—self-willed and <lb/>
            lawless men, but brave and full of endurance, and experi­ <lb/>
            enced soldiers. However, in a short time, Lucullus took <lb/>
            down the insolence of these soldiers, and changed the <lb/>
            character of the rest, who then, for the first time, as it <lb/>
            seems, knew what it was to have a genuine commander <lb/>
            and leader; for under other generals, they were used to <lb/>
            be courted, and spirited on to military service in such <lb/>
            wise as was agreeable to them. As to the enemy, matters <lb/>
            were thus: Mithridates, like most of the sophists,t full of <lb/>
            boasting at first, and rising up against the Romans arro­ <lb/>
            gantly, with an army unsubstantial in fact, but in appear­ <lb/>
            ance brilliant and pompous, had failed in his undertaking, <lb/>
            and exposed himself to ridicule; but now, when he was <lb/>
            going to commence the war a second time, taught by ex­ <lb/>
            perience he concentrated his powers in a real and effectual <lb/>
            preparation. Rejecting those motley numbers and many­ <lb/>
            tongued threats of the barbarians, and arms ornamented <lb/>
            with gold and precious stones, which he considered to be <lb/>
            the spoils of the victors, and to give no strength to those <lb/>
            who possess them, he set about having Roman swords <note type="footnote"> of which, the Thracian Bosporus or the channel of Constantinople, it <lb/>
            is connected with the Euxine or Black Sea, and by the other, the <lb/>
            Hellespontus or Dardanelles, it is connected with the Aegean Sea or the <lb/>
            Archipelago. This is now the Sea of Marmora. Part of the southern <lb/>
            and eastern coast belonged to Bithynia. The city of Kyzikus was <lb/>
            within the Propontis. </note><note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Sulla, c. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> t The sophists of Plutarch's time were rhetoricians, who affected to <lb/>
            declaim on any subject, which they set off with words and phrases and <lb/>
            little more. One of the noted masters of this art, Aristides of Bithynia, <lb/>
            might have been known to Plutarch, though he was younger than <lb/>
            Plutarch. Many of his unsubstantial declamations are extant. Plutarch <lb/>

            gether horses which were well trained, instead of horses <lb/>
            which were well caparisoned; and one hundred and <lb/>
            twenty thousand foot-soldiers who were disciplined to the <lb/>
            Roman order of battle, and sixteen thousand horse-soldiers, <lb/>
            without reckoning the scythe-bearing four-horse chariots, <lb/>
            and these were a hundred; besides, his ships were not <lb/>
            filled with tents embroidered with gold, nor with baths <lb/>
            for concubines, nor apartments for the women luxuriously <lb/>
            furnished; but fitting them out fully with arms, missiles, <lb/>
            and stores, he invaded Bithynia, where he was again <lb/>
            gladly received by the cities, and not by these cities only, <lb/>
            for a return of their former calamities had visited all Asia, <lb/>
            which was suffering past endurance from the Roman <lb/>
            money-lenders * and farmers of the taxes.t These men, who, <lb/>
            like so many harpies, were plundering the people of their <lb/>
            substance, Lucullus afterwards drove out; but, for the <lb/>
            time, he endeavoured by reproof to make them more mode­ <lb/>
            rate in their conduct, and he stopped the insurrection of <lb/>
            the towns, when, so to speak, not a single man in them <lb/>
            was quiet.</p>
          <p>VIII. While Lucullus was busied about these matters, <lb/>
            Cotta, thinking it a good opportunity for himself, was <lb/>
            preparing to fight with Mithridates; and, though many <lb/>
            persons brought him intelligence that Lucullus was en­ <lb/>
            camped in Phrygia on his advanced march, Cotta, think­ <lb/>
            ing that he had the triumph all but in his hands, hastened <lb/>
            to engage, that Lucullus might have no share in it. But <lb/>
            he was defeated by land and by sea at the same time ; and <lb/>
            he lost sixty vessels with all the men in them, and four <note type="footnote"> * The Romans carried on a thriving trade in this way in the provinces. <lb/>
            In Cicero's period we find that many men of rank did not scruple to <lb/>

            Roman word Publicani, means the men who farmed the taxes in the <lb/>
            provinces. The Publicani at this period belonged to the order of the <lb/>
            Equites. A number of them associated themselves in a partnership <lb/>
            (societas) for the farming of the taxes of some particular province. <lb/>
            These associations had their agents in the provinces and a chief <lb/>
            manager (magister) at Rome. The collection of the taxes gave <lb/>
            employment to a great number of persons; and thus the Publicani <lb/>
            had at their disposal numerous places in the provinces, which gave <lb/>

            thousand foot soldiers, and he was shut up in Chalkedon* <lb/>
            and besieged there, and obliged to look for help at the hands <lb/>
            of Lucullus. Now there were some who urged Lucullus <lb/>
            not to care for Cotta, but to advance forward, as he would <lb/>
            be able to seize the kingdom of Mithridates, which was <lb/>
            unprotected; and this was the language of the soldiers <lb/>
            especially, who were indignant that Cotta, not satisfied <lb/>
            with ruining himself and those with him by his imprudent <lb/>
            measures, should be a hindrance to their getting a victory <lb/>
            without a contest when it was in their power; but Lucullus <lb/>
            said in reply to all this in an harangue, that he would <lb/>
            rather save one Roman from the enemy than get all that the <lb/>
            enemy had. And when Archelaus,† who had commanded <note type="footnote"> The taxes were taken at some sum that was agreed upon; and we <lb/>
            find an instance mentioned by Cicero (Ad Attic. i. 17) in which their <lb/>
            competition or their greediness led them to give too much and to call <lb/>
            on the Senate to cancel the bargain. The Romans at this time <lb/>
            derived little revenue from Italy, and the large expenditure had to be <lb/>
            supplied out of the revenue raised in the provinces and collected by <lb/>

            modern times, and the state sometimes required their assistance to <lb/>
            provide the necessary supplies. <lb/>
            It seems probable that the Publican! who farmed the taxes of a pro­ <lb/>
            vince, underlet them to others; which would be one cause of oppres­ <lb/>
            sion. These Collectors (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τελω̑ναι</foreign>) are called Publicans in the English <lb/>
            version of the New Testament, where they are no doubt very justly <lb/>
            coupled with sinners. </note><note type="footnote"> * Appian (Mithridat. War, c. 71) states that Mithridates invaded <lb/>
            Bithynia, for King Nikomedes bad just died childless and left his <lb/>
            kingdom to the Romans. Cotta fled before him and took refuge in <lb/>
            Chalkedon, a city situated on the Asiatic side of the Thracian Bosporus <lb/>
            opposite to the site of Constantinople. The consul would not go out <lb/>
            to meet the enemy, but his admiral Nudus with some troops occupied <lb/>
            the strongest position in the plain. However, he was defeated by <lb/>
            Mithridates and with difficulty got again into the city. In the con­ <lb/>
            fusion about the gates the Romans lost three thousand men. Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates also broke through the chain that was thrown across the harbour <lb/>

            in the command in Asia. At the instigation of Archelaus, Murena <lb/>
            attacked and plundered Comana in Cappadocia, which belonged to <lb/>
            Mithridates, and contained a temple of great sanctity and wealth. <lb/>
            Mithridates in vain complained to Murena, and then sent an embassy</note> <lb/>

            for Mithridates in Bœotia, and afterwards had left him, and <lb/>
            was now in the Roman army, maintained that if Lucullus <lb/>
            would only show himself in Pontus, he might make <lb/>
            himself master of everything at once, Lucullus replied <lb/>
            that he was not a greater coward than huntsmen, which <lb/>
            he should be if he passed by the wild beasts and went <lb/>
            to their empty dens. Saying this he advanced against <lb/>
            Mithridates, with thirty thousand foot-soldiers and two <lb/>
            thousand five hundred cavalry. On arriving in sight of <lb/>
            theenemy, he was startled at their numbers, and wished <lb/>
            to avoid a battle and to protract the time. Marius, <lb/>
            however, whom Sertorius had sent from Iberia to Mith­ <lb/>
            ridates in command of a force, came out to meet Lucullus, <lb/>
            and challenged him to the contest, on which Lucullus <lb/>
            put his army in order of battle; and they were just on the <lb/>
            point of commencing the engagement, when, without any <lb/>
            evident change, but all at once, the sky opened, and there <lb/>
            appeared a huge flame-like body, which came down be­ <lb/>
            tween the two armies, in form most like a cask, and in <lb/>
            colour resembling molten silver, so that both armies were <lb/>
            alarmed at the sight and separated. This, it is said, took <lb/>
            place in Phrygia, at a place called Otryæ. Lucullus, <lb/>
            considering that it was not possible for any human re­ <lb/>
            sources or wealth to maintain for any length of time, and <lb/>
            in the presence of an enemy, so many thousands as Mith­ <lb/>
            ridates had, ordered one of the prisoners to be brought to <lb/>
            him, and asked him first how many messmates he had, <lb/>
            and then how much provision he had left in his tent. <lb/>
            When the man had given his answer, he ordered him to <lb/>
            be removed, and he put the same question to a second, and <lb/>
            to a third. Then comparing the amount of provisions <lb/>
            that the enemy had with the number of those who were to <lb/>
            be fed, he concluded that the enemy's provisions would <lb/>
            fail them in three or four days. He now stuck still <lb/>
            more closely to his plan of protracting the time, and he <lb/>
            employed himself in getting into his camp a great store of <note type="footnote">to Rome. Appian considers this conduct of Murena as the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the Second Mithridatic War, B.O. 83. The Third commenced <lb/>
            B.C. 74 with the league of Mithridates and Sertorius. (Appian, Mith. <lb/>

            wait till the enemy was reduced to want.</p>
          <p>IX. In the meantime Mithridates resolved to attack <lb/>
            the Kyzikeni,* who had received a blow in the battle at <lb/>
            Chalkedon, for they had lost three thousand men and ten <lb/>
            ships. Accordingly, wishing to give Lucullus the slip, he <lb/>
            put himself in motion immediately after supper, taking <lb/>
            advantage of a dark and rainy night; and he succeeded <lb/>
            in planting his force at daybreak right opposite to the <lb/>
            city, at the base of the mountain tract of the Adrasteia.t <lb/>
            Lucullus, who perceived his movements and followed him, <lb/>
            was well satisfied that he had not come up with the enemy <lb/>
            while his own troops were out of battle order; and he <lb/>
            posted his army near the village named Thrakia, in a <lb/>
            position excellently adapted to command the roads and <lb/>
            the places from which and through which the soldiers of <lb/>
            Mithridates must bring their supplies. Now, as he had in <lb/>
            his own mind a clear comprehension of the issue, he did <lb/>
            not conceal it from his men; but as soon as he had chosen <lb/>
            his ground, and the men had finished the entrenchments, <lb/>
            he summoned them together, and confidently told them <lb/>
            that he would, in a few days, give them a victory which <lb/>
            would cost no blood. Mithridates had hemmed in the <lb/>
            Kyzikeni with ten camps on the land side, and towards <lb/>
            the sea with his ships, by blocking up the narrow channel <lb/>
            which separates tile city from the mainland, and thus he <note type="footnote"> * Kyzikus. The ruins of this ancient city, now Bal Kiz, that id <lb/>
            Palæa Kyzikus, lie near to the east of the sandy isthmus which now <lb/>
            connects the peninsula of Kyzikus with the moinland. Hamilton <lb/>
            (Researches in Asia Minor, &amp;c., London, 1842, ii. 102), says that " the <lb/>
            loose and rubbly character of the buildings of Kyzikus little accords <lb/>
            with the celebrity of its architects; and although some appear to have <lb/>
            been cased with marble, none of them give an idea of the solid grandeur <lb/>
            of the genuine Greek style." Yet Strabo (p. 575) describes this city <lb/>
            as among the first of Asia. In his time the present peninsula was an <lb/>
            island, which was connected with the mainland by two bridges: the <lb/>
            city was near the bridges, and had two harbours that could be closed. <lb/>
            Under the Romans in Strabo's time, Kyzikus was a Free City (Libera <lb/>
            Civitas). </note><note type="footnote">t This range Is described by Strabo as opposite to Kyzikus, on the <lb/>

            is not singular. Dindymus was a solitary hill, and on the peninsula <lb/>

            were disposed to resist the enemy boldly, and had <lb/>
            determined to sustain all hardships for the sake of the <lb/>
            Romans, they were troubled at not knowing where Lu­ <lb/>
            cullus was, and at having heard nothing of him. Yet <lb/>
            the army of Lucullus was visible and in sight of the city ; <lb/>
            but the citizens were deceived by the soldiers of Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, who pointed to the Romans in their entrenchments <lb/>
            on the higher ground, and said, "Do you see them ? That <lb/>
            is the army of the Armenians and Modes, which Tigranes <lb/>
            has sent to support Mithridates."</p>
          <p>The Kyzikeni were alarmed to see such a host of enemies <lb/>
            around them, and they had no hopes that they could be <lb/>
            released, even if Lucullus should come. However, Demonax, <lb/>
            who was sent to them by Archelaus, was the first to <lb/>
            inform them of Lucullus being there. While they were <lb/>
            distrusting his intelligence, and thinking that he had <lb/>
            merely invented this story to comfort them in their diffi­ <lb/>
            culties, there came a youth, who had been captured by the <lb/>
            enemy and made his escape. On their asking him where <lb/>
            he supposed Lucullus to be, he laughed outright, for he <lb/>
            thought they were making sport of him ; but, seeing that <lb/>
            they were in earnest, he pointed with his hand to the <lb/>
            Roman camp, and the citizens again took courage. Now <lb/>
            the lake Daskylitis * is navigable for boats of a considerable <lb/>
            size, and Lucullus, drawing up the largest of them, and <lb/>
            conveying it on a waggon to the sea-coast, put into it as <lb/>
            many soldiers as it would hold. The soldiers crossed over <lb/>
            by night unobserved, and got into the city.</p>
          <p>X. It appears that the deity, also, admiring the bravery <lb/>
            of the Kyzikeni, encouraged them by other manifest signs, <lb/>
            and especially by this: the festival called Persephassia† <lb/>
            was at hand, and as they had not a black cow to sacrifice, <lb/>
            they made one of dough, and placed it at the altar. The <note type="footnote"> *This is a small lake near the coast of the Propontis. at the back <lb/>

            cow which was intended to be the victim, and was fatten­ <lb/>
            ing for the goddess, was pasturing, like the other animals <lb/>
            of the Kyzikeni, on the opposite mainland; but on that <lb/>
            day, leaving the rest of the herd by itself, it swam over <lb/>
            the channel to the city and presented itself to be sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed. The goddess also appeared in a dream to Arista­ <lb/>
            goras, the town-clerk,* and said: “ For my part, I am <lb/>
            come, and I bring the Libyan fifer against the Pontic <lb/>
            trumpeter. Bid the citizens, then, be of good cheer. " <lb/>
            The Kyzikeni were wondering at these words, when at <lb/>
            daybreak the sea began to be disturbed by an unsteady, <lb/>
            changing wind that descended upon it, and the engines of <lb/>
            the king, which were placed near the walls—admirable <lb/>
            contrivances of Nikonides the Thessalian—by their creak­ <lb/>
            ing and rattling showed what was going to happen: then <lb/>
            a south-west wind, bursting forth with incredible fury, <lb/>
            broke to pieces the other engines in a very short time, and <lb/>
            shook and threw down the wooden tower, which was a <lb/>
            hundred cubits high. It is told that Athena appeared to <lb/>
            many of the people in Ilium in their sleep, streaming <lb/>
            with copious sweat, showing part of her peplus rent, <lb/>
            and saying that she had just returned from helping the <lb/>
            Kyzikeni. And the people of Ilium used to show a stele t <lb/>
            which contained certain decrees and an inscription about <lb/>
            these matters. <note type="footnote"> * What lie was I don't know. Xaltwasser translates the word <lb/>

            Reiske's conjecture <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραμματε</foreign>ȋ, because the grammateus was an impor­ <lb/>

            not mentioned as an ordinary personage at this period. But Kaltwasser <lb/>

          <p>XI. Mithridates, so long as he was deceived by his <lb/>
            generals and kept in ignorance of the famine in his army, <lb/>
            was annoyed at the Kyzikeni holding out against the <lb/>
            blockade. But his ambition and his haughtiness quickly <lb/>
            oozed away when he had discovered the straits in which <lb/>
            his army was held, and that they were eating one an­ <lb/>
            other; for Lucullus was not carrying on the war in a <lb/>
            theatrical way, nor with mere show; but, as the proverb <lb/>
            says, was kicking against the belly, and contriving every <lb/>
            means how he should cut off the food. Accordingly, while <lb/>
            Lucullus was engaged in besieging a certain garrisoned <lb/>
            post, Mithridates, seizing the opportunity, sent off into <lb/>
            Bithynia nearly all his cavalry, with the beasts of burden, <lb/>
            and all his superflous infantry. Lucullus hearing of this, <lb/>
            returned to his camp during the night, and early in the <lb/>
            following morning, it being winter time, getting ready <lb/>
            ten cohorts and the cavalry, he followed the troops of <lb/>
            Mithridates, though it was snowing, and his soldiers <lb/>
            Buffered so much that many of them gave in by reason of <lb/>
            the cold, and were left behind: however, with the rest he <lb/>
            came up with the enemy at the river Rhyndakus,* and <lb/>
            gave them such a defeat that the women came from the <lb/>
            town of Apollonia and carried off the baggage and stripped <lb/>
            the dead. Many fell in the battle, as might be supposed, <lb/>
            but there were taken six thousand horses, with a countless <lb/>
            number of baggage-beasts, and fifteen thousand men, all <lb/>
            whom he led back past the camp of the enemy. I wonder <lb/>
            at Sallustius saying that this was the first time that the <lb/>
            Romans saw the camel; t for he must have supposed that <lb/>
            the soldiers of Scipio, who some time before had defeated <lb/>
            Antiochus, and those who had also fought with Archelaus <note type="footnote"> * This river enters Lake Apollonias on the south side of the lake, <lb/>
            and issues from the north side of the lake, whence it flows in a general <lb/>

            Abullionte, though the Greeks still call it by its ancient name, is <lb/>
            situated on a small island which is on the east side of Lake Apollonias <lb/>
            and is now connected with the mainland by a wooden bridge. If the <lb/>
            battle was fought on the river, the women must have gone a considerably <lb/>

            at Orchomenus and Chæronea, were unacquainted with <lb/>
            the camel. Now Mithridates had determined to fly as <lb/>
            soon as he could; but, with the view of contriving some­ <lb/>
            thing which should draw Lucullus in the other direction, <lb/>
            and detain him in his rear, he sent his admiral, Aristonikus, <lb/>
            to the Grecian sea, and Aristonikus was just on the point <lb/>
            of setting sail when he was betrayed to Lucullus, who got <lb/>
            him into his power, together with ten thousand pieces of <lb/>
            gold which he was carrying to bribe a part of the Roman <lb/>
            army with. Upon this Mithridates fled to the sea, and <lb/>
            his generals led the land forces off. But Lucullus falling <lb/>
            upon them at the river Granikus,* took many prisoners, <lb/>
            and slew twenty thousand of them. It is said that near <lb/>
            three hundred thousand persons were destroyed out of the <lb/>
            whole number of camp-followers and fighting-men.</p>
          <p>XII. Upon entering Kyzikus, Lucullus took his pleasure, <lb/>
            and enjoyed a friendly reception suitably to the occasion ; <lb/>
            he next visited the Hellespont, and got his navy equipped. <lb/>
            Arriving at the Troad,t he placed his tent within the <lb/>
            sacred precincts of Aphrodite, and as he was sleeping there <lb/>
            he thought that he saw the goddess in the night standing <lb/>
            by him, saying: <lb/>
            ,. Why slumber, lion of the mighty heart? <lb/>
            The fawns are near at hand' <lb/>
            Waking from sleep, Lucullus called his friends and told <lb/>
            them his dream, while it was still night; and there came <lb/>
            persons from Ilium, who reported that thirteen of the <lb/>
            king's quinqueremes had been seen near the Achæan <lb/>
            harbour, moving in the direction of Lemnos. Immediately <note type="footnote"> * This river is to the west of Kyzikus and enters the Propontis by <lb/>
            a general north course. On the banks of this river Alexander won <lb/>
            his first victory in his Persian campaign. (Arrian, Anab. i. 14.) <lb/>
            Appian, in his account of the defeat of the army of Mithridates <lb/>
            Mithridat. War, c. 76) places it on the Aesepus, a river which lies <lb/>
            between Kyzikus and the Granikus, and abo flows into the Propontis. <lb/>
            He also adds that the Aesepus was then at its greatest flood, which <lb/>
            contributed to the loss of Mithridates. But it appears from Appian <lb/>
            that the remnant of the army of Mithridates crossed the Granikus also, <lb/>
            for they reached Lampsakus. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Troad is a district, but Plutarch expresses himself as if lie <lb/>
            meant a town. It appears that Lucullus was near Ilium. The Achæan <lb/>
            harbour, or harbour of the Achæans, is near the promontory Sigeium. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="433"/>
            setting sail, Lucullus captured these vessels and killed <lb/>
            their commander, Isidorus, and he then advanced against <lb/>
            the other captains. Now, as they happened to be at <lb/>
            anchor, they drew all their vessels together up to the land, <lb/>
            and, fighting from the decks, dealt blows on the men of <lb/>
            Lucullus; for the ground rendered it impossible to sail <lb/>
            round to the enemy's rear, and, as the ships of Lucullus <lb/>
            were afloat, they could make no attack on those of the <lb/>
            enemy, which were planted close to the land and securely <lb/>
            situated. However, with some difficulty, Lucullus landed <lb/>
            the bravest of his soldiers in a part of the island which <lb/>
            was accessible, who, falling on the rear of the enemy, <lb/>
            killed some and compelled the rest to cut their cables and <lb/>
            make their escape from the land, and so to drive their <lb/>
            vessels foul of one another, and to be exposed to the blows <lb/>
            of the vessels of Lucullus. Many of the enemy perished; <lb/>
            but among the captives there was Marius,* he who was <lb/>
            sent from Sartorius. Marius had only one eye, and the <lb/>
            soldiers had received orders from Lucullus, as they were <lb/>
            setting out on the expedition, to kill no one-eyed man; <lb/>
            for Lucullus designed to make Marius die a shameful and <lb/>
            dishonourable death.</p>
          <p>XIII. As soon as he had accomplished this, Lucullus <lb/>
            hastened in pursuit of Mithridates; for he expected still <lb/>
            to find him about Bithynia, and watched by Voconius, <lb/>
            whom he had sent with ships to Nikomedia t to follow up <lb/>
            the pursuit. But Voconius lingered in Samothrakia,‡ <lb/>
            where he was getting initiated into mysteries and cele­ <lb/>
            brating festivals. Mithridates, who had set sail with hilt <lb/>
            armament, and was in a hurry to reach Pontus before <lb/>
            Lucullus returned, was overtaken by a violent storm, by <note type="footnote"> * Appian Mithridat. War, c. 77) simply says that Luoullus ordered <lb/>

            which is near the western extremity of the Propontis and west of the <lb/>
            Granikus. From Parium he sailed to Nikomedia, a fact omitted by <lb/>
            Plutarch, which explains the other fact, which he does mention, of <lb/>

            sunk; and all the coast for many days was filled with the <lb/>
            wrecks that were cast up by the waves. The merchant- <lb/>
            vessel in which Mithridates was embarked could not <lb/>
            easily be brought to land by those who had the manage­ <lb/>
            ment of it, by reason of its magnitude, in the agitated <lb/>
            state of the water, and the great swell, and it was already <lb/>
            too heavy to hold out against the sea, and was water­ <lb/>
            logged; accordingly the king got out of the vessel into <lb/>
            a piratical ship, and, intrusting his person to pirates, <lb/>
            contrary to expectation and after great hazard he arrived <lb/>
            at Heraklea * in Pontus. Now it happened that the proud <lb/>
            boast of Lucullus to the Senate brought on him no divine <lb/>
            retribution.t The Senate was voting a sum of three <lb/>
            thousand talents to equip a navy for the war, but Lu­ <lb/>
            cullus stopped the measure by sending a letter, couched in <lb/>
            vaunting terms, in which he said, that without cost and <lb/>
            so much preparation, he would with the ships of the allies <lb/>
            drive Mithridates from the sea. And he did this with <lb/>
            the aid of the deity; for it is said that it was owing to <lb/>
            the anger of Artemis Priapine ‡ that the storm fell on the <lb/>
            Pontic soldiers, who had plundered her temple and carried <lb/>
            off the wooden statue. <note type="footnote"> * This place was on the coast ofBithynia. Appian (c. 78) says that <lb/>
            Mithridates landed at Sinope (Sinab), a large town considerably east of <lb/>

            t This notion is common in the Greek writers; the gods brought <lb/>
            misfortune on those whose prosperity was excessive, and visited them <lb/>
            with punishment for arrogant speaking and boasting. Among instances <lb/>
            of those whose prosperity at last brought calamity on them was Poly­ <lb/>
            krates, tyrant of Samos (Herodotus, iii. 125); a notorious instance of <lb/>

            was a Milesian colony, others a colony of Kyzikus. It derived its name <lb/>
            from the god Priapus, who was in great repute here and in Lampsakus. <lb/>

          <p>XIV. Though many advised Lucullus to suspend the <lb/>
            war, he paid no heed to them: but, passing through <lb/>
            Bithynia and Galatia, he invaded the country of the king. <lb/>
            At first he wanted provisions, so that thirty thousand <lb/>
            Galatians followed him, each carrying on his shoulders a <lb/>
            medimnus of wheat; but as he advanced and reduced all <lb/>
            into his power, he got into such abundance of everything <lb/>
            that an ox was sold in the camp for a drachma, and a slave <lb/>
            for four drachmæ ; and, as to the rest of the booty, it was <lb/>
            valued so little that some left it behind, and others <lb/>
            destroyed it; for there were no means of disposing of <lb/>
            anything to anybody when all had abundance. The <lb/>
            Roman army had advanced with their cavalry and carried <lb/>
            their incursions as far as Themiskyra and the plains on <lb/>
            the Thermodon,* without doing more than wasting and <lb/>
            ravaging the country, when the men began to blame <lb/>
            Lucullus for peaceably gaining over all the cities, and they <lb/>
            complained that he had not taken a single city by storm, <lb/>
            nor given them an opportunity of enriching themselves <lb/>
            by plunder. “ Nay, even now,” they said, we are quitting <lb/>

            Lucullus had supposed that these notions would have led <lb/>
            the soldiers to such madness as they afterwards showed <lb/>
            he would not have overlooked or neglected these matters, <lb/>
            nor have apologised instead to those men who were blaming <lb/>
            his tardiness for thus lingering in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            insignificant villages for a long time, and allowing Mith­ <lb/>
            ridates to increase his strength. “ This is the very thing," <lb/>
            he said, “ that I wish, and I am sitting here with the design <lb/>
            of allowing the man again to become powerful, and to get <lb/>
            together a sufficient force to meet us, that he may stay, <lb/>
            and not fly from us when we advance. Do you not see <lb/>
            that a huge and boundless wilderness is in his rear, and the <lb/>
            Caucasus * is near, and many mountains which are full of <lb/>

            About 150 stadia south of the Paryadres range; but he does not say that <lb/>
            it is on the Lykus. It may be collected from the following chapter of <lb/>
            Plutarch that it was near the Lykus. Pompeius made Kabeira a city and <lb/>
            named it Diopolis. A woman named Pythodoris added to it and called <lb/>

            lost Syria after his defeat by Lucullus, B.C. 69; and he was finally <lb/>

            not have a more specious pretext than to be compelled to <lb/>
            aid a man who is his kinsman and a king. Why, then, <lb/>
            should we bring this about, and show Mithridates, who <lb/>
            does not know it, with whose aid he ought to carry on the <lb/>
            war against us? and why should we drive him against <lb/>
            his wish, and ingloriously, into the arms of Tigranes, in­ <lb/>
            stead of giving him time to collect a force out of his own <lb/>

            often defeated, rather than fight with the Medes and <lb/>
            Armenians ? "</p>
          <p>XV. Upon such considerations as these, Lucullus pro­ <lb/>
            tracted the time before Amisus without pushing the siege ; <lb/>
            and, when the winter was over, leaving Murena to blockade <lb/>
            the city, he advanced against Mithridates, who was posted <lb/>
            at Kabeira, and intending to oppose the Romans, as he had <lb/>
            got together a force of forty thousand infantry and four <lb/>
            thousand horse on whom he relied most. Crossing the <lb/>
            river Lykus into the plain, Mithridates offered the Romans <lb/>
            battle. A contest between the cavalry ensued, in which <lb/>
            the Romans fled, and Pomponius, a man of some note, <lb/>
            being wounded, was taken prisoner, and brought to Mith­ <lb/>
            ridates while he was suffering from his wounds. The king <lb/>
            asked him if he would become his friend if his life were <lb/>
            spared, to which Pomponius replied, "Yes, if you come to <lb/>
            terms with the Romans; if not, I shall be your enemy." <lb/>
            Mithridates admired the answer, and did him no harm. <lb/>
            Now, Lucullus was afraid to keep the plain country, as <lb/>
            the enemy were masters of it with their cavalry, and he <lb/>
            was unwilling to advance into the hilly region, which was <lb/>
            of great extent and wooded and difficult of access; but <lb/>
            it happened that some Greeks were taken prisoners, who <lb/>
            had fled into a cave, and the eldest of them, Artemidorus, <lb/>
            promised Lucullus to be his guide, and to put him in a <lb/>
            position which would be secure for his army, and also con­ <lb/>
            tained a fort that commanded Kabeira. Lucullus, trusting <lb/>
            the man, set out at nightfall after lighting numerous <lb/>
            fires, and getting through the defiles in safety; he gained <lb/>
            possession of the position; and, when the day dawned, he <lb/>
            was seen above the enemy, posting his soldiers in a place <lb/>
            which gave him the opportunity of making an attack if <lb/>
             <pb n="438"/>
            he chose to fight, and secured him against any assault <lb/>
            if he chose to remain quiet. At present neither general <lb/>
            had any intention of hazarding a battle; but it is said, that <lb/>
            while some of the king's men were pursuing a deer, the <lb/>
            Romans met them and attempted to cut off their retreat, <lb/>
            and this led to a skirmish, in which fresh men kept con­ <lb/>
            tinually coming up on both sides. At last the king's men <lb/>
            had the better, and the Romans, who from the ramparts <lb/>
            saw their comrades falling, were in a rage, and crowded <lb/>
            about Lucullus, praying him to lead them on, and calling <lb/>
            for the signal for battle. But Lucullus, wishing them to <lb/>
            learn the value of the presence and sight of a prudent <lb/>
            general in a struggle with an enemy and in the midst of <lb/>
            danger, told them to keep quiet; and, going down into the <lb/>
            plain and meeting the first of the fugitives, he ordered <lb/>
            them to stand, and to turn round and face the enemy with <lb/>
            him. The men obeyed, and the rest also facing about and <lb/>
            forming in order of battle, easily put the enemy to flight, <lb/>
            and pursued them to their camp. Lucullus, after retiring to <lb/>
            his position, imposed on the fugitives the usual mark of <lb/>
            disgrace, by ordering them to dig a trench of twelve feet <lb/>
            in their loose jackets, while the rest of the soldiers were <lb/>
            standing by and looking on.</p>
          <p>XVI. Now there was in the army of Mithridates a <lb/>
            prince of the Dandarii,* named Olthakus (the Dandarii are <lb/>
            one of the tribes of barbarians that live about the Mæotis), <lb/>
            a man distinguished in all military matters where strength <lb/>
            and daring are required, and also in ability equal to the <lb/>
            best, and moreover a man who knew how to ingratiate <lb/>
            himself with persons, and of insinuating address. Oltha­ <lb/>
            kus, who was always engaged in a kind of rivalry for dis­ <lb/>
            tinction with one of the princes of the kindred tribes, and <lb/>
            was jealous of him, undertook a great exploit for Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, which was to kill Lucullus. The king approved of <lb/>
            his design, and purposely showed him some indignities, <lb/>
            at which, pretending to be in a rage, Olthakus rode off to <note type="footnote"> * Some writers read Dardarii. The Dandarii are mentioned by <lb/>
            Strabo (p. 495) as one of the tribes on the Mæotis or Sea of Azoff. <lb/>
            Mithridates held the parts on the Bosporus. Appian (Mithridat. War, <lb/>
            c. 79) has thin story of Olthakus, whom he names Olkades, but he calk <lb/>
            him a Scythian. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="439"/>
            Lucullus, who gladly received him, for there was a great <lb/>
            report of him in the Roman army; and Lucullus, after <lb/>
            some acquaintance with him, was soon pleased with his <lb/>
            acuteness and his zeal, and at last admitted him to his <lb/>
            table and made him a member of his council. Now when <lb/>
            the Dandarian thought he had a fit opportunity, he ordered <lb/>
            the slaves to take his horse without the ramparts, and, as <lb/>
            it was noontide and the soldiers were lying in the open <lb/>
            air and taking their rest, he went to the general's tent, <lb/>
            expecting that nobody would prevent him from entering, <lb/>
            as he was on terms of intimacy with Lucullus, and said <lb/>
            that he was the bearer of some important news. And he <lb/>
            would have entered the tent without any suspicion, if <lb/>
            sleep, that has been the cause of the death of many gene­ <lb/>
            rals, had not saved Lucullus; for he happened to be <lb/>
            asleep, and Menedemus, one of his chamber-attendants, <lb/>
            who was standing by the door, said that Olthakus had not <lb/>
            come at a fit time, for Lucullus had just gone to rest him­ <lb/>
            self after long wakefulness and many toils. As Olthakus <lb/>
            did not go away when he was told, but said that he would <lb/>
            go in, even should Menedemus attempt to prevent him, <lb/>
            because he wished to communicate with Lucullus about a <lb/>
            matter of emergency and importance, Menedemus began <lb/>
            to get in a passion, and, saying that nothing was more <lb/>
            urgent than the health of Lucullus, he shoved the man <lb/>
            away with both his hands. Olthakus being alarmed stole <lb/>
            out of the camp, and, mounting his horse, rode off to the <lb/>
            army of Mithridates, without effecting his purpose. Thus, <lb/>
            it appears, it is with actions just as it is with medicines <lb/>
            -time and circumstance give to the scales that slight turn <lb/>
            which saves alive, as well as that which kills.</p>
          <p>XVII. After this Sornatius, with ten cohorts, was sent <lb/>
            to get supplies of corn. Being pursued by Menander, one <lb/>
            of the generals of Mithridates, Sornatius faced about and <lb/>
            engaged the enemy, of whom he killed great numbers and <lb/>
            put the rest to flight. Again, upon Adrianus being sent <lb/>
            with a force, for the purpose of getting an abundant <lb/>
            supply of corn for the army, Mithridates did not neglect the <lb/>
            opportunity, but sent Menemachus and Myron at the head <lb/>
            of a large body of cavalry and infantry. All this force, <lb/>
            as it is said, was cut to pieces by the Romans. with the <lb/>
             <pb n="440"/>
            exception of two men. Mithridates concealed the loss, <lb/>
            and pretended it was not so great as it really was, but a <lb/>
            trifling loss owing to the unskilfulness of the commanders. <lb/>
            However, Adrianus triumphantly passed by the camp <lb/>
            of the enemy with many waggons loaded with corn and <lb/>
            booty, which dispirited Mithridates, and caused irremedi­ <lb/>
            able confusion and alarm among his soldiers. Accordingly <lb/>
            it was resolved not to stay there any longer. But, while <lb/>
            the king's servants were quietly sending away their own <lb/>
            property first, and endeavouring to hinder the rest, the <lb/>
            soldiers, growing infuriated, pushed towards the passages <lb/>
            that led out of the camp, and, attacking the king's servants, <lb/>
            began to seize the luggage and massacre the men. In <lb/>
            this confusion Dorylaus the general, who had nothing else <lb/>
            about him but his purple dress, lost his life by reason of <lb/>
            it, and Hermæus, the sacrificing priest, was trampled to <lb/>
            death at the gates. The king himself,* without attend­ <lb/>
            ant or groom to accompany him, fled from the camp mingled <lb/>
            with the rest, and was not able to get even one of the <lb/>
            royal horses, till at last the eunuch Ptolemaeus, who was <lb/>
            mounted, spied him as as he was hurried along in the <lb/>
            stream of fugitives, and leaping down from his horse <lb/>
            gave it to the king. The Romans, who were following <lb/>
            in pursuit, were now close upon the king, and so far as it <lb/>
            was a matter of speed they were under no difficulty about <lb/>
            taking him, and they came very near it; but greediness <lb/>
            and mercenary motives snatched from the Romans the <lb/>
            prey which they had so long followed up in many <lb/>
            battles and great dangers, and robbed Lucullus of the <lb/>
            crowning triumph to his victory; for the horse which <lb/>
            was carrying Mithridates was just within reach of his <lb/>
            pursuers, when it happened that one of the mules which <lb/>
            was conveying the king's gold either fell into the hands <lb/>
            of the enemy accidentally, or was purposely thrown in <lb/>
            their way by the king's orders, and while the soldiers <lb/>
            were plundering it and getting together the gold, and <lb/>
            fighting with one another, they were left behind. And <lb/>
            this was not the only loss that Lucullus sustained from <note type="footnote">* The strange panic that seized Mithridates is also described by <lb/>
            Appian (Mithridat. War, o. 81). He fled to Comana and thence to <lb/>

            their greediness; he had given his men orders to bring to <lb/>
            him Kallistratus, who had the charge of all the king's <lb/>
            secrets; but those who were taking him to Lucullus, find­ <lb/>
            ing that he had five hundred gold pieces in his girdle, <lb/>
            put him to death. However, Lucullus allowed his men <lb/>
            to plunder the camp.</p>
          <p>XVIII. After taking Kabeira and most of the other forts <lb/>
            Lucullus found in them great treasures, and also places <lb/>
            of confinement, in which many Greeks and many kinsmen <lb/>
            of the king were shut up; and, as they had long consi­ <lb/>
            dered themselves as dead, they were indebted to the kind­ <lb/>
            ness of Lucullus, not for their rescue, but for restoration <lb/>
            to life and a kind of second birth. A sister also of Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, Nyssa, was captured, and so saved her life; but <lb/>
            the women who were supposed to be the farthest from <lb/>
            danger, and to be securely lodged at Phernakia,* the <lb/>
            sisters and wives of Mithridates, came to a sad end, <lb/>
            pursuant to the order of Mithridates, which he sent <lb/>
            Bacchides,† a eunuch, to execute, when he was compelled <note type="footnote"> * Phernakia or Phamakia, as it is generally read, is a town in Pontus <lb/>
            on the coast of the Black Sea. It is generally assumed that Pharnakia <lb/>
            was the same as Kerasus mentioned by Xenophon in the Retreat of the <lb/>
            Ten Thousand, and the place being now called Kerasunt seems to <lb/>
            establish this. Arrian in his Periplus of the Euxine states that it was <lb/>
            originally named Kerasus. A difficulty is raised on this point because <lb/>
            Xenophon says that the Greeks reached Kerasus in three days from <lb/>
            Trebizond, and the country is difficult. Hamilton observes (i. 250) ; <lb/>
            “ Considering the distance and the difficult nature of the ground, over <lb/>
            a great part of which the army must have marched in single file, <lb/>
            Xenophon and his 10,000 men would hardly have arrived there in ten <lb/>
            days." But it is more probable that there is an error in the “ three " <lb/>
            days, either an error of Xenophon or of the MSB., than that the site <lb/>
            of Phernakia should have got the name of Kerasunt though Kerasus <lb/>
            was not there. “ The town of Kerasunt, which represents the <lb/>
            Pharnakia of antiquity, is situated on the extremity of a rocky promon­ <lb/>
            tory connected with the main by a low wooded isthmus of a pleasing <lb/>
            and picturesque appearance.—The Hellenic walls are constructed in <lb/>
            the beat isodomous style. Commencing near the beach on the west, <lb/>
            they continue in an easterly direction over the hill, forming the limits <lb/>
            of the present town. Near the gateway they are upwards of twenty <lb/>
            feet high, and form the foundation of the Agha's konak; a small <lb/>

            to take to flight. Among many other women there were <lb/>
            two sisters of the king, Roxana and Statira, each about <lb/>
            forty years of age and unmarried; and two of his wives, <lb/>
            Ionian women, one of them named Berenike from Chios, <lb/>
            and the other Monime a Milesian. Monime was much <lb/>
            talked of among the Greeks, and there was a story to this <lb/>
            effect, that though the king tempted her with an offer of <lb/>
            fifteen thousand gold pieces, she held out until a marriage <lb/>
            contract was made, and he sent her a diadem * with the <lb/>
            title of queen. Now Monime hitherto was very unhappy, <lb/>
            and bewailed that beauty which had given her a master <lb/>
            instead of a husband, and a set of barbarians to watch <lb/>
            over her instead of marriage and a family; and she la­ <lb/>
            mented that she was removed from her native country, <lb/>
            enjoying her anticipated happiness only in imagination, <lb/>
            while she was deprived of all those real pleasures which <lb/>
            she might have had at home. When Bacchides arrived, <lb/>
            and told the women to die in such manner as they might <lb/>
            judge easiest and least painful, Monime pulled the diadem <lb/>
            from her head, and, fastening it round her neck, hung <lb/>
            herself. As the diadem soon broke, “ Cursed rag !" she <lb/>
            exclaimed, “ you won't even do me this service;" and, <lb/>
            spitting on it, she tossed it from her, and presented her <lb/>
            throat to Bacchides. Berenike took a cup of poison, and <lb/>
            gave a part of it to her mother, who was present, at <lb/>
            her own request. Together they drank it up; and the <lb/>
            strength of the poison was sufficient for the weaker of the <lb/>
            two, but it did not carry off Berenike, who had not drunk <lb/>
            enough, and, as she was long in dying, she was strangled <lb/>
            with the assistance of Bacchides. Of the two unmarried <lb/>
            sisters of Mithridates it is said, that one of them, after <lb/>
            uttering many imprecations on her brother and much <note type="footnote"> Greek women of western Asia were much in request among the <lb/>
            Asiatic kings. (Compare Life of Crassus, c. 32,. Cyrus the younger <lb/>
            had two Greek women with him when he fell at Cunaxa, and one of <lb/>
            them was a Milesian. (Xenophon, Anab. i. 10.) </note><note type="footnote"> * I have kept the Greek word. The description shows what it <lb/>
            was. The diadem was a mark of royal rank among the Asiatic <lb/>
            nations. Aurelian is said to have been the first Roman Emperor who <lb/>
            adopted the diadem, which appears on some of his coins. (Rasche, <lb/>
            Lex. Rei Numariae.) </note> <lb/>

            abuse, drank up the poison. Statira did not utter a word <lb/>
            of complaint, or anything unworthy of her noble birth; <lb/>
            but she commended her brother for that he had not <lb/>
            neglected them at a time when his own life was in danger, <lb/>
            and had provided that they should die free and be secure <lb/>
            against insult. All this gave pain to Lucullus, who was <lb/>
            naturally of a mild and humane temper.</p>
          <p>XIX. Lucullus advanced as far as Talaura,* whence <lb/>
            four days before Mithridates had fled into Armenia to <lb/>
            Tigranes. From Talaura Lucullus took a different direc­ <lb/>
            tion, and after subduing the Chaldæi and Tibareni, and <lb/>
            taking possession of the Less Armenia, and reducing forts <lb/>
            and cities, he sent Appius to Tigranes to demand Mith­ <lb/>
            ridates ; but he went himself to Amisus, which was still <lb/>
            holding out against the siege. This was owing to Kalli­ <lb/>
            machus the commander, who by his skill in mechanical <lb/>
            contrivances, and his ingenuity in devising every resource <lb/>
            which is available in a siege, gave the Romans great <lb/>
            annoyance, for which he afterwards paid the penalty. <lb/>
            Now, however, he was out-generalled by Lucullus, who, <lb/>
            by making a sudden attack, just at that time of the day <lb/>
            when he was used to lead his soldiers off and to give them <lb/>
            rest, got possession of a small part of the wall, upon which <lb/>
            Kallimachus quitted the city, having first set fire to it, <lb/>
            either because he was unwilling that the Romans should <lb/>
            get any advantage from their conquest, or with the view <lb/>
            of facilitating his own escape. For no one paid any atten­ <lb/>
            tion to those who were sailing out; but when the flames <lb/>
            had sprung up with violence, and got hold of the walls, <lb/>
            the soldiers were making ready to plunder. Lucullus, <lb/>
            lamenting the danger in which the city was of being <lb/>
            destroyed, attempted from the outside to help the citizens <lb/>
            against the fire, and ordered it to be put out; yet nobody <lb/>
            attended to him, and the soldiers called out for booty, and <lb/>
            shouted and struck their armour, till at last Lucullus was <lb/>
            compelled to let them have their way, expecting that he <lb/>
            should thus save the city at least from the fire. But the <lb/>
            soldiers did just the contrary; for, as they rummaged every <lb/>
            place by the aid of torches, and carried about lights in all <note type="footnote"> * The site of this place is unknown. Mithridates (Appian, Mith­ <lb/>
            ridat. War, o. 115) kept his valuables here. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="444"/>
            directions, they destroyed most of the houses themselves. <lb/>
            so that Lucullus, who entered the city at daybreak, said to <lb/>
            his friends with tears in his eyes, that he had often con­ <lb/>
            sidered Sulla a fortunate man, but on this day of all others <lb/>
            he admired the man's good fortune, in that when he chose <lb/>
            to save Athens he had also the power; “ but upon me," <lb/>
            he said, "who have been emulous to imitate his ex­ <lb/>
            ample, the daemon has instead brought the reputation of <lb/>
            Mummius." * However, as far as present circumstances <lb/>
            allowed, he endeavoured to restore the city. The fire <lb/>
            indeed was quenched by the rains that chanced to fall, as <lb/>
            the deity would have it, at the time of the capture, and <lb/>
            the greatest part of what had been destroyed Lucullus <lb/>
            rebuilt while he stayed at Amisus; and he received into <lb/>
            the city such of the Amisenes as had fled, and settled there <lb/>
            any other Greeks who were willing to settle, and added <lb/>
            to the limits of the territory a tract of one hundred and <lb/>
            twenty stadia. Amisus was a colony! of the Athenians, <lb/>
            planted, as one might suppose, at that period in which <lb/>
            their power was at its height and had the command of the <lb/>
            sea. And this was the reason why many who wished to <lb/>
            escape from the tyranny of Aristion ‡ sailed to the Euxine <lb/>
            and settled at Amisus, where they became citizens; but <lb/>
            it happened that by flying from misfortune at home they <lb/>
            came in for a share of the misfortunes of others. Lucullus, <lb/>
            however, clothed all of them who survived the capture of <lb/>
            the city, and, after giving each two hundred drachmae <lb/>
            besides, he sent them back to their home. On this occasion, <lb/>
            Tyrannic § the grammarian was taken prisoner. Murena <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Sulla, o. 14. L. Mummius after defeating the <lb/>
            army of the Achaean confederation totally destroyed Corinth B.C. 146. </note><note type="footnote"> t Strabo (p. 547) quotes Theopompus, who says that the Melisians <lb/>
            were the original founders of Amisus, and that after the Athenian <lb/>
            colonization it was called Peiræus. King Mithridates Eupator (the <lb/>
            opponent of Lucullus) added to the city. It was a flourishing place <lb/>
            when Strabo was writing his Geography. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See the Life of Sulla, c. 14. </note><note type="footnote"> § See the Life of Bulla, c. 26. Tyrannic is often mentioned by <lb/>
            Cicero. He arranged Cicero's library (Ad Attic. iv. 4 and 8), and he <lb/>
            was employed as a teacher in Cicero's house (Ad Quint. Frat. it. 4). </note><note type="footnote"> In alluding to Tyrannic being manumitted, Plutarch means to say <lb/>
            that by the act of minumission it was declared that Tyrannio had been <lb/>

             <pb n="445"/>
            asked him for himself, and on getting Tyrannic set him free, <lb/>
            wherein he made an illiberal use of the favour that he had <lb/>
            received; for Lucullus did not think it fitting that a man <lb/>
            who was esteemed for his learning should be made a slave <lb/>
            first and then a freedman; for the giving him an apparent <lb/>
            freedom was equivalent to the depriving him of his real <lb/>
            freedom. But it was not in this instance only that Murena <lb/>
            showed himself far inferior to his general in honourable <lb/>
            feeling and conduct.</p>
          <p>XX. Lucullus now turned to the cities of Asia, in order <lb/>
            that while he had leisure from military operations he <lb/>
            might pay some attention to justice and the law, which the <lb/>
            province had now felt the want of for a long time, and the <lb/>
            people had endured unspeakable and incredible calamities, <lb/>
            being plundered and reduced to slavery by the Publican! <lb/>
            and the money-lenders, so that individuals were compelled <lb/>
            to sell their handsome sons and virgin daughters, and the <lb/>
            cities to sell their sacred offerings, pictures and statues. <lb/>
            The lot of the citizens was at last to be condemned to <lb/>
            slavery themselves, but the sufferings which preceded were <lb/>
            ptill worse-the fixing of ropes and barriers,. and horses, <lb/>
            and standing under the open sky, during the heat in the <lb/>
            sun, and during the cold when they were forced into the <lb/>
            mud or the ice; so that slavery was considered a relief from <lb/>
            the burden of debt, and a blessing. Such evils as these <lb/>
            Lucullus discovered in the cities, and in a short time he <lb/>
            relieved the sufferers from all of them. In the first place, <lb/>
            he declared that the rate of interest should be reckoned at <lb/>
            the hundredth part,t and no more; in the second, he cut off <lb/>
            all the interest which exceeded the capital; thirdly, what <note type="footnote"> rights over him. This Murena was the son of the Murena who is <lb/>
            mentioned in Plutarch's Life of Sulla (o. 17). Cicero defended him <lb/>
            against a charge of Ambitus or bribery at his election for the con­ <lb/>
            sulship, and in his oration, which is extant, he speaks highly of him. <lb/>
            This Murena was Consul B.C. 62, the year after Cicero was Consul. </note><note type="footnote"> * This passage is very obscure. Some critics think that Plutarch is <lb/>
            speaking of torture. But it is more likely that he is speaking of the <lb/>
            debtors being in attendance at the courts and waiting under the open <lb/>
            sky at all seasons till the suits about the debts were settled. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is the Centesimæ usuræ of the Romans, which was at this <lb/>
            time the usual rate. It was one per cent. per month, or twelve per <lb/>
            cent. per annum. Cæsar (Life of Cæsar, a. 12) made a like settlement <lb/>
            between debtor and creditor in Spain. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="446"/>
            was most important of all, he declared that the lender <lb/>
            should receive the fourth part of the income of the debtor; <lb/>
            but any lender who had tacked the interest to the principal <lb/>
            was deprived of the whole: thus, in less than four years <lb/>
            all the debts were paid, and their property was given back <lb/>
            to them free from all encumbrance. Now the common debt <lb/>
            originated in the twenty thousand talents which Bulla <lb/>
            had laid on Asia as a contribution, and twice this amount <lb/>
            was repaid to the lenders, though they had indeed now <lb/>
            brought the debt up to the amount of one hundred and <lb/>
            twenty thousand talents by means of the interest. The <lb/>
            lenders, however, considered themselves very ill used, and <lb/>
            they raised a great outcry against Lucullus at Rome, and <lb/>
            they endeavoured to bribe some of the demagogues to attack <lb/>
            him; for the lenders had great influence, and had among <lb/>
            their debtors many of the men who were engaged in <lb/>
            public life. But Lucullus gained the affection of the cities <lb/>
            which had been favoured by him, and the other provinces <lb/>
            also longed to see such a man over them, and felicitated <lb/>
            those who had the good luck to have such a governer.</p>
          <p>XXI. Appius Clodius,* who was sent to Tigranes (now <lb/>
            Clodius was the brother of the then wife of Lucullus), <lb/>
            was at first conducted by the king's guides through the <lb/>
            upper part of the country, by a route unnecessarily cir­ <lb/>
            cuitous and roundabout, and one that required many days' <lb/>
            journeying; but, as soon as the straight road was indi­ <lb/>
            cated to him by a freedman, a Syrian by nation, he quitted <lb/>
            that tedious and tricky road, and, bidding his barbarian <lb/>
            guides farewell, he crossed the Euphrates in a few days, <lb/>
            and arrived at Antiocheia,† near Daphne. There he <note type="footnote"> * P. Appius Clodius or Claudius belonged to the Patrician Gens <lb/>
            of the Claudii. He was a clever, unprincipled fellow, and the bitter <lb/>
            enemy of Cicero, whom during his tribunate he caused to be banished. <lb/>
            There is more about him in the Life of Cæsar, c. 10. He was killed <lb/>
            by T. Annius Milo. <lb/>
            This wife of Lucullus, named Clodia, had several sisters of the <lb/>
            same name, as usual among the Romans. (Life of Marius, c. 1.) The <lb/>
            sister who married Q. M tellus Celer, is accused of poisoning him. </note><note type="footnote"> t A name formed like Alexandreia from Antiochus, the name by <lb/>
            which most of the Greek kings of Syria were designated. Antiocheia, <lb/>

            the small place Daphne, which was much resorted to as a place uf <lb/>
            pleasure by the people of Antiocheia. (Strabo, p. 749.) </note> <lb/>

            waited for Tigranes, pursuant to the king's orders (for <lb/>
            Tigranes was absent, and still engaged in reducing some <lb/>
            of the Phœnician cities), and in the meantime he gained <lb/>
            over many of the princes who paid the Armenian a hollow <lb/>
            obedience, among whom was Zarbienus, King of Gordyene,* <lb/>
            and he promised aid from Lucullus to many of the en­ <lb/>
            slaved cities, which secretly sent to him—bidding them, <lb/>
            however, keep quiet for the present. Now the rule of the <lb/>
            Armenians was not tolerable to the Greeks, but was harsh ; <lb/>
            and what was worse, the king's temper had become <lb/>
            violent and exceedingly haughty in his great prosperity ; <lb/>
            for he had not only everything about him which the <lb/>
            many covet and admire, but he seemed to think that <lb/>
            everything was made for him. Beginning with expecta­ <lb/>
            lions which were slight and contemptible, he had subdued <lb/>
            many nations, and humbled the power of the Parthians as <lb/>
            no man before him had done; and he filled Mesopotamia <lb/>
            with Greeks, many from Cilicia and many from Cappadocia, <lb/>
            whom he removed and settled. He also removed from <lb/>
            their abodes the Skenite Arabians,t and settled them near <lb/>
            him, that he might with their aid have the benefit of <lb/>
            commerce. Many were the kings who were in attendance <lb/>
            on him; but there were four who were always about him, <lb/>
            like attendants or guards, and when he mounted his horse <lb/>
            they ran by his side in jackets ; and when he was seated <lb/>
            and transacting business, they stood by with their hands <lb/>
            clasped together, which was considered to be of all atti­ <lb/>
            tudes the most expressive of servitude, as if they had sold <lb/>
            their freedom, and were presenting their bodies to their <lb/>
            master in a posture indicating readiness to suffer rather <lb/>
            than to act. Appius, however, was not alarmed or <lb/>
            startled at the tragedy show; but, as soon as he had an <lb/>
            opportunity of addressing the king, he told him plainly <lb/>
            that he was come to take back Mithridates, as one who <note type="footnote"> * This was a country on the upper part of the Tigris. It probably <lb/>
            contains the same element as the modern Kurdistan. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Skenite Arabians are the nomadic Arabs who live in tents. <lb/>
            Strabo (p. 747) speaks of them thus: “The parts of Mesopotam a <lb/>
            which are towards the south and at some distance from the mountains, <lb/>
            and are waterless and sterile, are occupied by the Skenite Arabs, who <lb/>
            are robbers and shepherds, and readily remove to other parts when the <lb/>
            pastures fail and booty is scarce," &amp;c. </note> <lb/>

            belonged to the triumphs of Lucullus, or to denounce wat <lb/>
            against Tigranes. Though the king made an effort to <lb/>
            preserve a tranquil mien, and affected a smile while he <lb/>
            was listening to the address, he could not conceal from <lb/>
            the bystanders that he was disconcerted by the bold <lb/>
            speech of the youth, he who had not for near five-and- <lb/>
            twenty years * heard the voice of a free man; for so many <lb/>
            years had he been king, or rather tyrant. However, he <lb/>
            replied to Appius that he would not give up Mithridates, <lb/>
            and that he would resist the Romans if they attacked him. <lb/>
            He was angry with Lucullus because he addressed him <lb/>
            in his letter by the title of King only, and not King of <lb/>
            Kings, and, accordingly in his reply, Tigranes did not <lb/>
            address Lucullus by the title of Imperator. But he sent <lb/>
            splendid presents to Appius, and when they were refused <lb/>
            he sent still more. Appius, not wishing to appear to re­ <lb/>
            ject the king's presents from any hostile feeling, selected <lb/>
            from among them a goblet, and sent the rest back; and <lb/>
            then with all speed set off to join the Imperator.</p>
          <p>XXII. Now, up to this time, Tigranes had not deigned <lb/>
            to see Mithridates,† nor to speak to him, though Mithri­ <lb/>

            from so great a kingdom ; but, in a degrading and insult­ <lb/>
            ing manner, he had allowed M ithridates to be far removed <lb/>
            from him, and, in a manner, kept a prisoner in his abode, <lb/>
            which was a marshy and unhealthy place. However, he <lb/>
            now sent for him with demonstrations of respect and <lb/>
            friendship. In a secret conference which took place in <lb/>
            the palace, they endeavoured to allay their mutual sus­ <lb/>
            picions, by turning the blame on their friends, to their <lb/>
            ruin. One of them was Metrodorus ‡ of Skepsis, an agree­ <lb/>
            able speaker, and a man of great acquirements, who en­ <lb/>
            joyed so high a degree of favour with Mithridates that he <lb/>
            got the name of the king's father. Metrodorus, as it seems, <lb/>
            had once been sent on an embassy from Mithridates to <note type="footnote"> * The embassy of Appius to Tigranes was in B.o. 71. See c. 14, <lb/>

            Tigranes, to pray for aid against the Romans, on which <lb/>
            occasion Tigranes asked him, " But you, Metrodorus, what <lb/>
            do you advise me in this matter?" Metrodorus, either <lb/>
            consulting the interests of Tigranes, or not wishing <lb/>
            Mithridates to be maintained in his kingdom, replied, <lb/>
            that, as ambassador, he requested him to send aid, but, <lb/>
            in the capacity of adviser, he told him not to send any. <lb/>
            Tigranes reported this to Mithridates, to whom he gave <lb/>
            the information, not expecting that he would inflict any <lb/>
            extreme punishment on Metrodorus. But Metrodorus was <lb/>
            forthwith put to death, and Tigranes was sorry for what <lb/>
            he had done, though he was not altogether the cause of <lb/>
            the misfortune of Metrodorus: indeed what he had said <lb/>
            merely served to turn the balance in the dislike of Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates towards Metrodorus; for Mithridates had for a long <lb/>
            time disliked Metrodorus, and this was discovered from <lb/>
            his private papers, that fell into the hands of the Romans, <lb/>
            in which there were orders to put Metrodorus to death. <lb/>
            Now, Tigranes interred the body with great pomp, sparing <lb/>
            no expense on the man, when dead, whom he had betrayed <lb/>
            when living. Amphikrates the rhetorician also lost his <lb/>
            life at the court of Tigranes, if he too deserves mention <lb/>
            for the sake of Athens. It is said that he fled to Seleu­ <lb/>
            keia,* on the Tigris, and that when the citizens there <lb/>
            asked him to give lectures on his art, he treated them <lb/>
            with contempt, saying, in an arrogant way, that a dish <lb/>
            would not hold a dolphin. Removing himself from Seleu­ <lb/>
            keia, he betook himself to Kleopatra, who was the daugh­ <lb/>
            ter of Mithridates, and the wife of Tigranes; but he soon <lb/>
            fell under suspicion, and, being excluded from all com­ <lb/>
            munion with the Greeks, he starved himself to death. <lb/>
            Amphikrates also received an honourable interment from <lb/>
            Kleopatra, and his body lies at Sapha, a place in those <lb/>
            parts so called.</p>

            administration and of peace, Lucullus did not neglect such <lb/>
            things as would gratify the people and gain their favour ; <lb/>
            but during his stay at Ephesus he gained popularity in <lb/>
            the Asiatic cities by processions and public festivals in <lb/>
            commemoration of his victories, and by contests of athletes <lb/>
            and gladiators. The cities on their side made a return by <lb/>
            celebrating festivals, called after the name of Lucullus, <lb/>
            to do honour to the man; and they manifested towards <lb/>
            him what is more pleasing than demonstrations of respect, <lb/>
            real affection. Now, when Appius had returned, and it <lb/>
            appeared that there was to be war with Tigranes, Lucullus <lb/>
            again advanced into Pontus, and, getting his troops <lb/>
            together, be besieged Sinope,* or rather the Cilicians of <lb/>
            the king's party, who were in possession of the city ; but <lb/>
            the Cilicians made their escape by night, after massacring <lb/>
            many of the Sinopians, and firing the city. Lucullus, <lb/>
            who saw what was going on, made his way into the city, <lb/>
            and slaughtered eight thousand of the Cilicians, who were <lb/>
            left there; but he restored to the rest of the inhabitants <lb/>
            their property, and provided for the interests of Sinope, <lb/>
            mainly by reason of a vision of this sort: he dreamed that <lb/>
            a man stood by him in his sleep, and said, “ Advance a <lb/>
            little, Lucullus; for Autolykus is come, and wishes to <lb/>
            meet with you." On waking, Lucullus could not con­ <lb/>
            jecture what was the meaning of the vision; but he took <lb/>
            the city on that day, and, while pursuing the Cilicians, <lb/>
            who were escaping in their ships, he saw a statue lying on <note type="footnote"> * Bacchides, according to Strabo, commanded in the city. Sinope <lb/>
            is described by Strabo (p. 545) as one of the chief towns of Asia in <lb/>
            his day. It was a Milesian colony. It was the birth-place of this <lb/>
            Mithridates, surnamed Eupator, who made it his capital. It was <lb/>
            situated on an isthmus which joined the mainland to the Chersonesus <lb/>
            (peninsula) which is mentioned by Plutarch in this chapter. There <lb/>
            were harbours and stations for ships on each side of the isthmus. The <lb/>
            present condition of the town is described by Hamilton (Researches, <lb/>
            L 306, &amp;c.) : “ The population and prosperity of Sinope are not such <lb/>
            as might be expected in a place affording such a safe harbour between <lb/>
            Constantinople and Trebizond. I observed also a general appearance <lb/>
            of poverty and privation throughout the peninsula." </note><note type="footnote"> In Strabo's time Sinope had received a Roman colony, and the <lb/>
            colonists had part of the city and of the territory. The word Colonia <lb/>
            in Greek (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κολωνεια</foreign>) appears on a sarcophagus which was seen by <lb/>
            Hamilton in a small village near Sinope. </note> <lb/>

            the beach, which the Cilicians had not had time to put <lb/>
            on board ; and the statue was the work of Sthenis,* one <lb/>
            of his good performances. Now, somebody told Lucullus <lb/>
            that it was the statue of Autolykus, the founder of Sinope. <lb/>
            Autolykus is said to have been one of those who joined <lb/>
            Herakles from Thessalia, in his expedition against the <lb/>
            Amazons, and a son of Deimachus. In his voyage home, <lb/>
            in company with Demoleon and Phlogius, he lost his ship, <lb/>
            which was wrecked at the place called Pedalium, in the <lb/>
            Chersonesus :† but he escaped with his arms and companions <lb/>
            to Sinope, which he took from the Syrians: for Sinope <lb/>
            was in possession of the Syrians, who were descended from <lb/>
            Syrus, the son of Apollo, according to the story, and <lb/>
            Sinope, the daughter of Asopus. On hearing this, Lu­ <lb/>
            cullus called to mind the advice of Sulla, who in his ‘ Me­ <lb/>
            moirs' advised to consider nothing so trustworthy and safe <lb/>
            as that which is signified in dreams. Lucullus was now <lb/>
            apprised that Mithridates and Tigranes were on the point <lb/>
            of entering Lycaonia and Cilicia, with the intention of <lb/>
            anticipating hostilities by an invasion of Asia, and he was <lb/>
            surprised that the Armenian, if he really intended to attack <lb/>
            the Romans, did not avail himself of the aid of Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, in the war when he was at the height of his power, <lb/>
            nor join his forces to those of Mithridates when he was <lb/>
            strong but allowed him to be undone and crushed; and <lb/>
            now began a war that offered only cold hopes, and threw <lb/>
            himself on the ground to join those who were already there <lb/>
            and unable to rise.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Now, when Machares also, the son of Mithridates, <lb/>
            who held the Bosporus, sent to Lucullus a crown worth <lb/>
            one thousand gold pieces, and prayed to be acknowledged <note type="footnote"> * Stbenis was a native of 0lynthus and a contemporary of Alexander <lb/>

            a friend and ally * of the Romans, Lucullus, considering <lb/>
            that the former war was at an end, left Sornatius in those <lb/>
            parts to watch over the affairs of Pontus with six thou­ <lb/>
            sand soldiers. He set out himself with twelve thousand <lb/>
            foot soldiers, and not quite three thousand horse, to com­ <lb/>
            mence a second campaign, wherein he seemed to be making <lb/>
            a hazardous move, and one not resting on any safe calcula­ <lb/>
            tion ; for he was going to throw himself among warlike <lb/>
            nations and many thousands of horsemen, and to enter <lb/>
            a boundless tract, surrounded by deep rivers and by <lb/>
            mountains covered with perpetual snow; so that his <lb/>
            soldiers, who were generally not very obedient to dis­ <lb/>
            cipline, followed unwillingly and made opposition: and <lb/>
            at Rome the popular leaders raised a cry against him, and <lb/>
            accused him of seeking one war after another, though the <lb/>
            State required no wars, that he might never lay down his <lb/>
            arms so long as he had command, and never stop making <lb/>
            his private profit out of the public danger; and in course <lb/>
            of time the demagogues at Rome accomplished their <lb/>
            purpose. Lucullus, advancing by hard marches to the <lb/>
            Euphrates, found the stream swollen and muddy, owing to <lb/>
            the winter season, and he was vexed on considering that <lb/>
            it would cause loss of time and some trouble if he had to <lb/>
            get together boats to take his army across and to build <lb/>
            rafts. However, in the evening the water began to sub­ <lb/>
            side, and it went on falling all through the night, and at <lb/>
            daybreak the bed of the river was empty. The natives <lb/>
            observing that some small islands in the river had become <lb/>
            visible, and that the stream near them was still, made <lb/>
            their obeisance to Lucullus; for this had very seldom hap­ <lb/>
            pened before, and they considered it a token that the river <lb/>
            had purposely made itself tame and gentle for Lucullus, <lb/>
            and was offering him an easy and ready passage. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, Lucullus took advantage of the opportunity, and <lb/>
            carried his troops over: and a favourable sign accom­ <lb/>
            panied the passage of the army. Cows feed in that neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood, which are sacred to Artemis Persia, a deity <lb/>
            whom the barbarians on the farther side of the Euphrates <note type="footnote"> * Socius et Amicus: this was the title which the Romans con­ <lb/>
            descended to give to a king who behaved towards them with due <lb/>
            respect and submission. (Livius, 31, c. 11.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="453"/>
            venerate above all others; they use the cows only for <lb/>
            sacrifice, which at other times ramble at liberty about the <lb/>
            country, with a brand upon them, in the form of the torch <lb/>
            of the goddess, and it is not very easy, nor without much <lb/>
            trouble, that they can catch the cows when they want <lb/>
            them. After the army had crossed the Euphrates one of <lb/>
            these cows came to a rock, which is considered sacred to <lb/>
            the goddess, and stood upon it, and there laying down its <lb/>
            head, just as a cow does when it is held down tight by a <lb/>
            rope, it offered itself to Lucullus to be sacrificed. Lucul­ <lb/>
            lus also sacrificed a bull to the Euphrates, as an acknow­ <lb/>
            ledgment for his passage over the river. He encamped <lb/>
            there for that day, and on the next and the following <lb/>
            days he advanced through Sophene * without doing any <lb/>
            harm to the people, who joined him and gladly received <lb/>
            the soldiers; and when the soldiers were expressing a <lb/>
            wish to take possession of a fortress, which was supposed <lb/>
            to contain much wealth, “ That is the fortress," said <lb/>
            Lucullus, " which we must take first," pointing to the <lb/>
            Taurus t in the distance; “ but this is reserved for the <lb/>
            victors." He now continued his route by hard marches, <lb/>
            and, crossing the Tigris, entered Armenia.</p>
          <p>XXV. Now, as the first person who reported to Tigranes <lb/>
            that Lucullus was in the country got nothing for his pains, <lb/>
            but had his head cut off, nobody else would tell him, and <lb/>
            Tigranes was sitting in ignorance while the fires of war <lb/>
            were burning round him, and listening to flattering words, <lb/>
            That Lucullus would be a great general if he should <lb/>
            venture to stand against Tigranes at Ephesus, and should <lb/>
            not flee forthwith from Asia, at the sight of so many tens <note type="footnote"> * Lucullus appears to have crossed the Euphrates at a more northern <lb/>

            called Masius and the range called Antitaurus: the capital or royal <lb/>
            residence was Carcathiocerta. (Strabo, p. 527.) </note><note type="footnote"> t The great mountain range to which this name was given by the <lb/>
            ancient geographers commences according to Strabo (p. 651) on the <lb/>
            south-east coast of Lycia. The name Taurus was not very exactly de­ <lb/>
            fined, but it comprehended the mountain region which runs eastward <lb/>
            from the point above mentioned in a general parallel direction to the <lb/>
            south coast of Asia Minor; and the name was extended to the high <lb/>
            lands of Armenia east of the Euphrates. Its eastern limit was vei, <lb/>

            of thousands. So true it is, that it is not every man who <lb/>
            can bear much wine, nor is it any ordinary understanding <lb/>
            that in great prosperity does not lose all sound judgment. <lb/>
            The first of his friends who ventured to tell him the truth <lb/>
            was Mithrobarzanes; and he, too, got no reward for his <lb/>
            boldness in speaking; for he was sent forthwith against <lb/>
            Lucullus, with three thousand horsemen and a very large <lb/>
            body of infantry, with orders to bring the general alive, <lb/>
            and to trample down his men. Now, part of the army of <lb/>
            Lucullus was preparing to halt, and the rest was still <lb/>
            advancing. When the scouts reported that the barbarian <lb/>
            was coming upon them, Lucullus was afraid that the enemy <lb/>
            would fall upon his troops while they were divided and <lb/>
            not in battle order, and so put them into confusion. Lu­ <lb/>
            cullus himself set to work to superintend the encampment, <lb/>
            and he sent Sextilius, one of his legati, with sixteen <lb/>
            hundred horsemen, and hoplitæ* and light-armed troops, <lb/>
            a few more in number, with orders to approach close to <lb/>
            the enemy, and wait till he should hear that the soldiers <lb/>
            who were with him had made their encampment. Sextilius <lb/>
            wished to follow his orders; but he was compelled to <lb/>
            engage by Mithrobarzanes, who was confidently advancing <lb/>
            against him. A battle ensued, in which Mithrobarzanes <lb/>
            fell fighting; and the rest, taking to flight, were all cut to <lb/>
            pieces with the exception of a few. Upon this Tigranes <lb/>
            left Tigranocerta,t a large city which he had founded, and <lb/>
            retreated to the Taurus, and there began to get together <lb/>
            his forces from all parts: but Lucullus, allowing him no <lb/>
            time for preparation, sent Murena to harass and cut off <lb/>
            those who were collecting to join Tigranes, and Sextilius <lb/>
            on the other side to check a large body of Arabs, who were <note type="footnote"> * This is the Greek word which I have sometimes kept. Plutarch <lb/>

            approaching to the king. It happened just at the same <lb/>
            time that Sextilius fell on the Arabs as they were encamp­ <lb/>
            ing and killed most of them, and Murena, following <lb/>
            Tigranes, took the opportunity of attacking him as he <lb/>
            was passing through a rough and narrow defile with his <lb/>
            army in a long line. Tigranes fled, and left behind him <lb/>
            all his baggage ; and many of the Armenians were killed <lb/>
            and still more taken prisoners.</p>
          <p>XXVI. After this success Lucullus broke up his camp <lb/>
            and marched against Tigranocerta, which he surrounded <lb/>
            with his lines, and began to besiege. There were in the <lb/>
            city many Greeks, a part of those who had been removed <lb/>
            from Cilicia, and many barbarians who had fared the same <lb/>
            way with the Greeks, Adiabeni,* and Assyrians, and <lb/>
            Gordyeni and Cappadocians, whose native cities Tigranes <lb/>
            had digged down, and had removed the inhabitants and <lb/>
            settled them there. The city was also filled with wealth <lb/>
            and sacred offerings, for every private individual and <lb/>
            prince, in order to please the king, contributed to the <lb/>
            increase and ornament of the city. For this reason Lu­ <lb/>
            cullus pressed the siege, thinking that Tigranes would <lb/>
            not endure this, but even contrary to his judgment,would <lb/>
            come down in passion and fight a battle; and he was not <lb/>
            mistaken. Now, Mithridates, both by messengers and <lb/>
            letters, strongly advised Tigranes not to fight a battle, <lb/>
            but to cut off the enemy's supplies by means of his <lb/>
            cavalry ; and Taxiles t also, who had come from Mith­ <lb/>
            ridates to join Tigranes, earnestly entreated the king to <lb/>
            keep on the defensive, and to avoid the arms of the <lb/>
            Romans, as being invincible. Tigranes at first readily <lb/>
            listened to this advice : but when the Armenians and <lb/>
            Gordyeni had joined him with all their forces, and the <lb/>
            kings were come, bringing with them all the power of <lb/>
            the Modes and Adiabeni, and many Arabs had arrived <lb/>
            from the sea that borders on Babylonia, and many <lb/>
            Albanians from the Caspian, and Iberians, who are neigh­ <lb/>
            hour! of the Albanians; and not a few of the tribes about <note type="footnote"> * The Adiabeni occupied a tract that was apparently a part of the <lb/>
            old Assyria on the east side of the Tigris. The element diab perhaps <lb/>

            the Araxes,* who are not governed by kings, had come to <lb/>
            join him, induced by solicitations and presents, and the <lb/>
            banquets of the king were filled with hopes and confidence <lb/>
            and barbaric threats, and his councils also,—Taxiles <lb/>
            narrowly escaped death for opposing the design of fight­ <lb/>
            ing, and it was believed that Mithridates wished to divert <lb/>
            Tigranes from obtaining a great victory, merely from <lb/>
            envy. Accordingly, Tigranes would not even wait for <lb/>
            Mithridates, for fear he should share in the glory; but <lb/>
            he advanced with all his force, and greatly complained to <lb/>
            his friends, it is said, that he would have to encounter Lu­ <lb/>
            cullus alone, and not all the Roman generals at once. And <lb/>
            his confidence was not altogether madness nor without <lb/>
            good grounds, when he looked upon so many nations and <lb/>
            kings following him, and bodies of hoplitæ, and tens of <lb/>
            thousands of horsemen ; for he was at the head of twenty <lb/>
            thousand bowmen and slingers and fifty-five thousand <lb/>
            horsemen, of whom seventeen thousand were clothed in <lb/>
            armour of mail, as Lucullus said in his letter to the Senate, <lb/>
            and one hundred and fifty thousand hoplitæ, some of whom <lb/>
            were drawn up in cohorts and others in phalanx; and of <lb/>
            road-makers, bridge-makers, clearers of rivers, timber­ <lb/>
            cutters, and labourers for other necessary purposes, there <lb/>
            were thirty-five thousand, who, being placed behind the <lb/>
            fighting men, added to the imposing appearance and the <lb/>
            strength of the army.</p>
          <p>XXVII. When Tigranes had crossed the Taurus, and, <lb/>
            showing himself with all his forces, looked down on the <lb/>
            Roman army, which was encamped before Tigranocerta, <lb/>
            the barbarians in the city hailed his appearance with <lb/>
            shouts and clapping of hands, and from their walls with <lb/>
            threats pointed to the Armenians. As Lucullus was con­ <lb/>
            sidering about the battle, some advised him to give up the <lb/>
            siege, and march against Tigranes; others urged him not <lb/>
            to leave so many enemies in his rear, nor to give up the <lb/>
            siege. Lucullus replied, that singly they did not advise <lb/>
            well, but that taken both together the counsel was good; <lb/>
            on which he divided his army. He left Murena with six <note type="footnote"> * This is the river now generally called the Aras, which flows into <lb/>
            tile Caspian on the south-west side. Before it enters the sea, it is joined <lb/>
            by the Cyrus, now the Cur. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            thousand foot to maintain the siege ; and himself taking <lb/>
            twenty-four cohorts, among which there were not above <lb/>
            ten thousand hoplitæ, with all his cavalry and slingers <lb/>
            and bowmen, to the number of about one thousand, <lb/>
            advanced against the enemy. Lucullus, encamping in a <lb/>
            large plain by the bank of the river, appeared contemptible <lb/>
            to Tigranes, and furnished matter for amusement to the <lb/>
            king's flatterers. Some scoffed at him, and others, by way <lb/>
            of amusement, cast lots for the spoil, and all the generals <lb/>
            and kings severally applied to the king, and begged the <lb/>
            matter might be intrusted to each of them singly, and <lb/>
            that Tigranes would sit as a spectator. Tigranes also <lb/>
            attempted to be witty, and, in a scoffing manner, he <lb/>
            uttered the well-known saying, " If they have come as <lb/>
            ambassadors, there are too many of them; if as soldiers, <lb/>
            too few." Thus they amused themselves with sarcastic <lb/>
            sayings and jokes. At daybreak Lucullus led out his <lb/>
            troops under arms. Now the barbarian army was on the east <lb/>
            side of the river; but, as the river makes a bend towards <lb/>
            the west, at a part where it was easiest to ford, Lucullus <lb/>
            led his troops out, and hurried in that direction, which <lb/>
            led Tigranes to think that he was retreating; and calling <lb/>
            Taxiles to him he said, with a laugh, " Don't you see that <lb/>
            these invincible Roman warriors are flying ?” Taxiles <lb/>
            replied: “ I should be pleased, 0 king, at any strange <lb/>
            thing happening which should be lucky to you ; but the <lb/>
            Roman soldiers do not put on their splendid attire when <lb/>
            they are on a march; nor have they then their shields <lb/>
            cleaned, and their helmets bare, as they now have, by <lb/>
            reason of having taken off the leathern coverings; but <lb/>
            this brightness of their armour is a sign they are going <lb/>
            to fight, and are now marching against their enemies." <lb/>
            While Taxiles was still speaking the first eagle came in <lb/>
            sight; for Lucullus had now faced about, and the cohorts <lb/>
            were seen taking their position in manipuli for the purpose <lb/>
            of crossing the river: on which Tigranes, as if he were <lb/>
            hardly recovering from a drunken bout, called out two or <lb/>
            three times, " What, are they coming against us ? " and so, <lb/>
            with much confusion, the enemy's soldiers set about getting <lb/>
            into order, the king taking his position in the centre, and <lb/>
            giving the left wing to the King of the Adiabeni, and the <lb/>
             <pb n="458"/>
            right to the Mede, on which wing also were the greater <lb/>
            part of the soldiers, clad in mail, occupying the first ranks. <lb/>
            As Lucullus was going to cross the river, some of the <lb/>
            officers bade him beware of the day, which was one of the <lb/>
            unlucky days which the Romans call black days; for on <lb/>
            that day Cæpio * and his army were destroyed in a battle <lb/>
            with the Cimbri. Lucullus replied in these memorable <lb/>
            words: " Well, I will make it a lucky day for the <lb/>
            Romans." The day was the sixth of October.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Saying this, and bidding his men be of good <lb/>
            cheer, Lucullus began to cross the river, and advanced <lb/>
            against the enemy at the head of his soldiers, with a <lb/>
            breastplate of glittering scaly steel, and a cloak with a <lb/>
            fringed border, and he just let it be seen that his sword <lb/>
            was already bare, thereby indicating that they must <lb/>
            forthwith come to close quarters with the enemy, who <lb/>
            fought with missiles, and by the rapidity of the attack cut <lb/>
            off the intervening space, within which the barbarians <lb/>
            could use their bows. Observing that the mailed cavalry, <lb/>
            which had a great reputation, were stationed under an <lb/>
            eminence, crowned by a broad level space, and that the <lb/>
            approach to it was only a distance of four stadia, and <lb/>
            neither difficult nor rough, he ordered the Thracian cavalry <lb/>
            and the Gauls who were in the army, to fall on them in the <lb/>
            flank, and to beat aside their long spears with their swords. <lb/>
            Now the mailed horsemen rely solely on their long spears, <lb/>
            and they can do nothing else, either in their own defence <lb/>
            or against the enemy, owing to the weight and rigidity <lb/>
            of their armour, and they look like men who are walled <lb/>
            up in it. Lucullus himself, with two cohorts, I u shed on <lb/>
            vigorously to the hill, followed by his men, who were <lb/>
            encouraged by seeing him in his armour, enduring all the <lb/>
            fatigue on foot, and pressing forwards. On reaching the <lb/>
            summit, Lucullus stood on a conspicuous spot, and called <note type="footnote"> * See the Life of Sertorius, c. 3. The rout of this large army of <lb/>
            Tigranes is described by Appian (Mithridat War, c. 85). The day <lb/>
            was the 6th of October, and the year B.C. 69. The loss that is reported <lb/>
            in some of these ancient battles seems hardly credible; but it is <lb/>
            explained here. There was in fact no battle: the enemy were struck <lb/>
            with a panic and fled. An immense multitude if seized with alarm <lb/>
            requires no enemy to kill them. The loss of life that may occur in a <lb/>
            frightened crowd is enormous. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            cut aloud : " We have got the victory! Fellow soldiers, <lb/>
            we have got the victory! " With these words he led his <lb/>
            men against the mailed horsemen, and ordered them not <lb/>
            to use their javelins yet, but every man to hold them in <lb/>
            both hands, and to thrust against the enemy's legs and <lb/>
            thighs, which are the only parts of these mailed men that <lb/>
            are bare. However, there was no occasion for this mode <lb/>
            of fighting ; for the enemy did not stand the attack of the <lb/>
            Romans, but, setting up a shout and flying most disgrace­ <lb/>
            fully, they threw themselves and their horses, with all <lb/>
            their weight, upon their own infantry, before the inf intry <lb/>
            had begun the battle, so that so many tens of thousands <lb/>
            were defeated before a wound was felt or blood was drawn. <lb/>
            Now the great slaughter began when the army turned to <lb/>
            flight, or rather attempted to fly, for they could not really <lb/>
            fly, owing to the closeness and depth of their ranks, which <lb/>
            made them in the way of one another. Tigranes, riding <lb/>
            off at the front, fled with a few attendants, and, seeing <lb/>
            that his son was a partner in his misfortune, he took off <lb/>
            the diadem from his head, and, with tears, presented it to <lb/>
            him, at the same time telling him to save himself, as he <lb/>
            best could, by taking some other direction. The youth <lb/>
            would not venture to put the diadem on his head, but <lb/>
            gave it to the most faithful of his slaves to keep. This <lb/>
            slave, happening to be taken, was carried to Lucullus, and <lb/>
            thus the diadem of Tigranes, with other booty, fell into the <lb/>
            hands of the Romans. It is said that above one hundred <lb/>
            thousand of the infantry perished, and very few of the <lb/>
            cavalry escaped. On the side of the Romans, a hundred <lb/>
            were wounded, and five killed. Antiochus * the philosopher, <lb/>
            who mentions this battle in his ‘ Treatise on the Gods,' says <lb/>
            that the sun never saw a battle like it. Strabo, another <lb/>
            philosopher,† in his ‘ Historical Memoirs,’ says that the <lb/>
            Romans were ashamed, and laughed at one another, for <lb/>
            requiring arms against such a set of slaves. And Livius ‡ <lb/>
            observed that the Romans never engaged with an enemy <lb/>
            with such inferiority of numbers on their side, for the victors <note type="footnote"> * See chapter 42. </note><note type="footnote"> t See Life of Sulla, c. 26, Notes. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This part of Livius is lost; but it belonged to the ninety-eighth <lb/>
            book, as we see from the Epitome. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            were hardly the twentieth part of the defeated enemy, but <lb/>
            somewhat less. The most skilful of the Roman generals, <lb/>
            and those who had most military experience, commended <lb/>
            Lucullus chiefly for this, that he had out-gene railed the <lb/>
            two most distinguished and powerful kings by two most <lb/>
            opposite manoeuvres, speed and slowness; for he wore out <lb/>
            Mithridates, at the height of his power, by time and pro­ <lb/>
            tracting the war ; but he crushed Tigranes by his activity: <lb/>
            and he was one of the very few commanders who ever <lb/>
            employed delay when he was engaged in active operations, <lb/>
            and bold measures when his safety was at stake.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Mithridates made no haste to be present at the <lb/>
            battle, because he supposed that Lucullus would carry on <lb/>
            the campaign with his usual caution and delay; but he <lb/>
            was advancing leisurely to join Tigranes. At first he fell <lb/>
            in with a few Armenians on the road, who were retreat­ <lb/>
            ing in great alarm and consternation, and he conjectured <lb/>
            what had happened, but as he soon heard of the defeat <lb/>
            from a large number whom he met, who had lost their <lb/>
            arms and were wounded, he set out to seek Tigranes. <lb/>
            Though he found Tigranes destitute of everything, and <lb/>
            humbled, Mithridates did not retaliate for his former <lb/>
            haughty behaviour, but he got down from his horse, and <lb/>
            lamented with Tigranes their common misfortunes; he also <lb/>
            gave Tigranes a royal train that was attending on him, <lb/>
            and encouraged him to hope for the future. Accordingly, <lb/>
            the two kings began to collect fresh forces. Now, in the <lb/>
            city of Tigranocerta * the Greeks had fallen to quarrelling <lb/>
            with the barbarians, and were preparing to surrender the <lb/>
            place to Lucullus, on which lie assaulted and took it. <lb/>
            Lucullus appropriated to himself the treasures in the city, <lb/>
            but he gave up the city to be plundered by the soldiers, <lb/>
            which contained eight thousand talents of coined money, <lb/>
            with other valuable booty. Besides this, Lucullus gave to <lb/>
            each man eight hundred drachmæ out of the produce of the <lb/>
            spoils. Hearing that many actors had been taken in the <lb/>
            city, whom Tigranes had collected from all quarters, with <lb/>
            the view of opening the theatre which he had constructed, <note type="footnote"> * The capture is described by Appian (Mithridat. War, c. 86), and <lb/>
            by Dion Cassius (35, o. 2). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="461"/>
            Lucullus employed them for the games and shows in cele­ <lb/>
            bration of the victory. The Greeks he sent to their homes, <lb/>
            and supplied them with means for the journey, and in like <lb/>
            manner those barbarians who had been compelled to settle <lb/>
            there ; the result of which was that the dissolution of one <lb/>
            city was followed by the restoration of many others, which <lb/>
            thus recovered their citizens, by whom Lucullus was be­ <lb/>
            loved as a benefactor and a founder. Everything else also <lb/>
            went on successfully and conformably to the merits of the <lb/>
            general, who sought for the praise that is due to justice <lb/>
            and humanity, and not the praise that follows success in <lb/>
            war: for the success in war was due in no small degree, <lb/>
            to the army and to fortune, but his justice and humanity <lb/>
            proved that he had a mild and well-regulated temper ; and <lb/>
            it was by these means that Lucullus now subdued the <lb/>
            barbarians without resorting to arms ; for the kings of the <lb/>
            Arabs came to him to surrender all that they had, and the <lb/>
            Sopheni also came over to him. He also gained the affec­ <lb/>
            tion of the Gordyeni so completely that they were ready <lb/>
            to leave their cities, and to follow him, as volunteers, <lb/>
            with their children and wives, the reason of which was as <lb/>
            follows: Zarbienus, the King of the Gordyeni, as it has <lb/>
            been already told, secretly communicated, through Appius, <lb/>
            with Lucullus about an alliance, being oppressed by the <lb/>
            tyranny of Tigranes; but his design was reported to <lb/>
            Tigranes, and he was put to death, and his children and <lb/>
            wife perished with him, before the Romans invaded <lb/>
            Armenia. Lucullus did not forget all this; and, on enter­ <lb/>
            ing Gordyene, he made a funeral for Zarbienus, and, orna­ <lb/>
            menting the pile with vests, and the king's gold, and the <lb/>
            spoils got from Tigranes. he set fire to it himself, and <lb/>
            poured libations on the pile, with the friends and kinsmen <lb/>
            of the king, and gave him the name of friend and ally of <lb/>
            the Roman people. He also ordered a monument to be <lb/>
            erected to him at great cost; for a large quantity of gold <lb/>
            and silver was found in the palace of Zarbienus, and there <lb/>
            were stored up three million medimni of wheat, so that <lb/>
            the soldiers were well supplied, and Lucullus was admired, <lb/>
            that without receiving a drachma from the treasury, he <lb/>
            made the war support itself.</p>
          <p>XXX. While Lucullus was here, there came an embassy <lb/>
             <pb n="462"/>
            from the King of the Parthians * also, who invited him to <lb/>
            friendship and an alliance. This proposal was agreeable <lb/>
            to Lucullus, and in return he sent ambassadors to the <lb/>
            Parthian, who discovered that he was playing double and <lb/>
            secretly asking Mesopotamia from Tigranes as the price of <lb/>
            his alliance. On hearing this Lucullus determined to pass <lb/>
            by Tigranes and Mithridates as exhausted antagonists, and <lb/>
            to try the strength of the Parthians, and to march against <lb/>
            them, thinking it a glorious thing, in one uninterrupted <lb/>
            campaign, like an athlete, to give three kings in succes­ <lb/>
            sion the throw, and to have made his way through three <lb/>
            empires, the most powerful under the run, unvanquished <lb/>
            and victorious. Accordingly he sent orders to Sornatius <lb/>
            and the other commanders in Pontus to conduct the army <lb/>
            there to him, as he was intending to advance from Gord­ <lb/>
            yene farther into Asia. These generals had already <lb/>
            found that the soldiers were difficult to manage and muti­ <lb/>
            nous ; but now they made the ungovernable temper of the <lb/>
            soldiers quite apparent, being unable by any means of <lb/>
            persuasion or compulsion to move the soldiers, who, with <lb/>
            solemn asseverations, declared aloud that they would not <lb/>
            stay even where they were, but would go and leave Pontus <lb/>
            undefended. Report of this being carried to the army of <lb/>
            Lucullus effected the corruption of his soldiers also, who <lb/>
            had been made inert towards military service by the <lb/>
            wealth they had acquired and their luxurious living, and <lb/>
            they wanted rest; and, when they heard of the bold words <lb/>
            of the soldiers in Pontus, they said they were men, and <lb/>
            their example ought to be followed, for they had done <lb/>
            enough to entitle them to be released from military service, <lb/>
            and to enjoy repose.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Lucullus, becoming acquainted with these and <lb/>
            other still more mutinous expressions, gave up the ex­ <lb/>
            pedition against the Parthians, and marched a second time <lb/>
            against Tigranes. It was now the height of summer ; and <lb/>
            Lucullus was dispirited after crossing the Taurus, to see <note type="footnote"> * Compare Appian, c. 87, and Dion Cassius (35, c. 3). Sallustius <lb/>
            In the fourth book of his History has given a long letter, which we <lb/>
            may presume to be his own composition, from Mithridates to Arsakes, <lb/>
            this Parthian king, in which he urges him to fight against the Romans <lb/>

            that the fields were still green,. so much later are the <lb/>
            seasons, owing to the coldness of the air. However, <lb/>
            he descended from the Taurus, and, after defeating the <lb/>
            Armenians, who twice or thrice ventured to attack him, <lb/>
            he plundered the villages without any fear; and, by seiz­ <lb/>
            ing the corn which had been stored up by Tigranes, he <lb/>
            reduced the enemy to the straits which he was apprehend­ <lb/>
            ing himself. Lucullus challenged the Armenians to battle <lb/>
            by surrounding their camp with his lines and ravaging <lb/>
            the country before their eyes; but, as this did not make <lb/>
            them move after their various defeats, he broke up and <lb/>
            advanced against Artaxata, the royal residence of Tigranes, <lb/>
            where his young children and wives were, thinking that <lb/>
            Tigranes would not give them up without a battle. It is <lb/>
            said that Hannibal the Carthaginian, after the defeat of <lb/>
            Antiochus by the Romans, went to Artaxas the Armenian, <lb/>
            to whose notice he introduced many useful things; and, <lb/>
            observing a position which possessed great natural advan­ <note type="footnote"> * Lucullas was marching northward, and he had to ascend from the <lb/>
            lower country to the high lands of Armenia, wheie the seasons are <lb/>
            much later than in the lower country. He expected to find the corn <lb/>
            ripe. Nothing precise as to his route can be collected from Plutarch. <lb/>
            He states that Lucullus came to the Arsanias, a river which he must <lb/>
            cross before he could reach Artaxata. Strabo (p. 528) describes <lb/>
            Artaxata as situated on a peninsula formed by the Araxes (Aras) and <lb/>
            surrounded by the stream, except at the isthmus which joined it to <lb/>
            the mainland ; the isthmus was defended by a ditch and rampart. <lb/>
            The ruins called Takt Tiridate, the Throne of Tiridates, which have <lb/>
            been supposed to represent Artaxata, are twenty miles from the river, <lb/>
            and the place where they stand owed its strength solely to the fortifi­ <lb/>
            cations. Below the junction of the Zengue and Aras, which unite <lb/>
            near Erivan, "the river (Aras) winds very much, and at least twenty <lb/>
            positions nearly surrounded by the river presented themselves." Colonel <lb/>
            Monteith, who makes this remark (London Geog. Journal, iii. 47), found <lb/>
            no ruins on the banks of the river which answered to the description <lb/>
            of Artaxata ; for what he describes as near the remains of a Greek or <lb/>
            Roman bridge over the Aras do not correspond to the description <lb/>
            of Strabo. The remains of Artaxata, if they exist, must be looked for <lb/>
            on some of the numerous positions which are nearly surrounded by the <lb/>
            river. </note><note type="footnote"> The Arsanias is described by Plinius (Hist. Nat. v. 24) as flowing <lb/>
            into the Euphrates, and, it appears, into the Murad or eastern branch <lb/>
            which rises at no great distance S.W. of Ararat. It is probable that <lb/>
            Lucullus entered Armenia by some of the passes west of Lake Van ; <lb/>
            but his route can hardly be conjectured. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="464"/>
            tages and was very pleasant, though at that time unoccupied <lb/>
            and neglected, he made the plan of a city on the ground, <lb/>
            and, taking Artaxas there, showed it to him, and urged <lb/>
            him to build up the place. The king, it is said, was pleased, <lb/>
            and asked Hannibal to superintend the work; and there­ <lb/>
            upon a large and beautiful city sprung up, and, being <lb/>
            named after the king, was declared to be the capital of <lb/>
            Armenia. Tigranes did not let Lucullus quietly march <lb/>
            against Artaxata, but, moving with his forces on the fourth <lb/>
            day, he encamped opposite to the Romans, placing the <lb/>
            river Arsanias between him and the enemy, which river <lb/>
            the Romans must of necessity cross on their route to <lb/>
            Artaxata. After sacrificing to the gods, Lucullus, con­ <lb/>
            sidering that he had the victory in his hands, began to <lb/>
            lead his army across the river, with twelve cohorts in <lb/>
            the van, and the rest placed as a reserve to prevent the <lb/>
            enemy from attacking his flank. There was a large body <lb/>
            of picked cavalry opposed to the Romans, and in front of <lb/>
            them Mardi mounted archers, and Iberians * armed with <lb/>
            spears, on whom Tigranes relied more than any of his <lb/>
            mercenaries, as being the most warlike of all. However, <lb/>
            they showed no gallant spirit; but, after a slight skirmish <lb/>
            with the Roman cavalry, they did not venture to stand <lb/>
            the attack of the infantry, and separating and taking to <lb/>
            flight on both sides they drew after them the cavalry in <lb/>
            the pursuit. At the moment when this part of the enemy <lb/>
            was dispersed, the cavalry, which was about Tigranes, <lb/>
            rode forward, and Lucullus was alarmed when he saw <lb/>
            their brave appearance and numbers. He recalled the <lb/>
            cavalry from the pursuit, and himself was the first to <lb/>
            meet the Satrapeni, † who were posted opposite to him with <lb/>
            the king's chief officers; but before they came to close <lb/>
            quarters, the enemy was panic-struck and turned to flight. <lb/>

            fully ; for he did not stay to hear even the shouts of the <lb/>
            Romans. The pursuit was continued for a great distance <lb/>
            and all night long, and the Romans were wearied with <lb/>
            killing and taking prisoners, and getting valuables and <lb/>
            booty. Livius * says that in the former battle a greater <lb/>
            number of the enemy, but in this more men of rank fell <lb/>
            and were taken prisoners.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Elated and encouraged by this victory, Lucul­ <lb/>
            lus was intending to advance farther into the country, <lb/>
            and to subdue the barbarian; but contrary to what one <lb/>
            would have expected at the season of the autumnal equinox, <lb/>
            they were assailed by heavy storms, generally snow-storms, <lb/>
            and, when the sky was clear, there was hoar-frost and ice, <lb/>
            owing to which the horses could not well drink of the <lb/>
            rivers, by reason of the excessive cold; and they were diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to ford, because the ice broke, and the rough edges cut <lb/>
            the horses' sinews. And as the greater part of the country <lb/>
            was shaded and full of defiles and wooded, the soldiers were <lb/>
            kept continually wet, being loaded with snow while they <lb/>
            were marching, and spending the night uncomfortably in <lb/>
            damp places. Accordingly, they had not followed Lucullus <lb/>
            for many days after the battle when they began to offer <lb/>
            resistance, at first making entreaties and also sending the <lb/>
            tribunes to him, and then collecting in a tumultuous <lb/>
            manner, with loud shouts in their tents by night, which is <lb/>
            considered to be an indication that an army is in a state of <lb/>
            mutiny. Yet Lucullus urged them strongly, and called on <lb/>
            them to put endurance in their souls till they had taken <lb/>
            and destroyed the Armenian Carthage, the work of their <lb/>
            greatest enemy, meaning Hannibal. Not being able to <lb/>
            prevail on them, he led them back by a different pass over <lb/>
            the Taurus, and descended into the country called Myg­ <lb/>
            donike, which is fertile and warm, and contains a large <lb/>
            and populous city, which the barbarians called Nisibis,t <note type="footnote"> * Appian (Mithridat. War, c. 87) gives a very confused account of <lb/>
            this campaign. It is briefly described by Dion Cassius (35, c. 5). </note><note type="footnote"> t This is the modern Nisibin in 37° N. lat. on the Jakhjakhah, <lb/>

            but the Greeks Antiocha Mygdonike. The city was de­ <lb/>
            fended in name by Gouras, a brother of Tigranes, but in <lb/>
            fact by the experience and mechanical skill of Kallimachus, <lb/>
            who had given Lucullus great trouble in the siege of <lb/>
            Amisus also. Lucullus seated himself before the city, and, <lb/>
            by availing himself of every mode of pressing a siege, <lb/>
            in a short time he took the city by storm. Gouras, who <lb/>
            surrendered himself to Lucullus, was treated kindly ; but <lb/>
            he would not listen to Kallimachus, though he promised <lb/>
            to discover concealed treasures of great value; and he <lb/>
            ordered him to be brought in chains to be punished for the <lb/>
            conflagration by which he destroyed Amisus and deprived <lb/>
            Lucullus of the object of his ambition and an opportunity <lb/>
            of displaying his friendly disposition to the Greeks.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. So far one may say that fortune accompanied <lb/>
            Lucullus and shared his campaigns: but from this time, <lb/>
            just as if a wind had failed him, trying to force everything <lb/>
            and always meeting with obstacles, he displayed indeed <lb/>
            the courage and endurance of a good commander, but his <lb/>
            undertakings produced him neither fame nor good opinion, <lb/>
            and even the reputation that he had he came very near <lb/>
            losing by his want of success and his fruitless disputes. <lb/>
            Lucullus himself was in no small degree the cause of all <lb/>
            this; for he was not a man who tried to gain the affection <lb/>
            of the soldiery, and he considered everything that was <lb/>
            done to please the men as a disparagement to the general's <lb/>
            power, and as tending to destroy it. But, what was worst <lb/>
            of all, he was not affable to the chief officers and those <lb/>
            of the same rank as himself; he despised everybody, and <lb/>
            thought no man had any merit compared with his own.­ <note type="footnote"> of Nisibis, are the only remains of a city which is often mentioned in <lb/>
            the ancient history of the East. <lb/>
            The town is mentioned by Tacitus (Annal. xv. 35) under the name <lb/>
            of Nisibis, and he places it thirty-nine RomAn miles from Tigranocerta. <lb/>
            Nisibis is also the name in Ammianus Marcellinus. Dion Cassius <lb/>
            (36, c. 6, 7) describes the siege and capture of Nisibis. This event <lb/>
            belongs to the year B.C. 68. </note><note type="footnote"> * Compare Dion Cassius (36, c. 16) as to the behaviour of Lucullus. <lb/>
            He was too strict a disciplinarian for soldiers who were accustomed to <lb/>
            licence; and he did not even attempt to win the love of his men by <lb/>
            kindness. The mutinous army that he could not control was quiet <lb/>
            and obedient to Pompeius. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="467"/>
            These bad qualities, it is said, that Lucullus had, though <lb/>
            he possessed many merits. He was tall and handsome, a <lb/>
            powerful speaker, and equally prudent in the Forum and <lb/>
            the camp. Now, Sallustius says that the soldiers were <lb/>
            ill-disposed towards him at the very commencement of <lb/>
            the war before Kyzikus, and again at Amisus, because they <lb/>
            were compelled to spend two winters in succession in <lb/>
            camp. They were also vexed about the other winters, <lb/>
            for they either spent them in a hostile country or en­ <lb/>
            camped among the allies under the bare sky ; for Lucullus <lb/>
            never once entered a Greek and friendly city with his <lb/>
            army. While the soldiers were in this humour, they <lb/>
            received encouragement from the demagogues at Rome, <lb/>
            who envied Lucullus, and charged him with protract­ <lb/>
            ing the war through love of power and avarice. They <lb/>
            said that he all but held at once Cilicia, Asia, Bithynia, <lb/>
            Paphlagonia, Galatia, Pontus, Armenia, and the parts as <lb/>
            far as the Phasis, and that at last he had plundered even <lb/>
            the palace of Tigranes, as if he had been sent to strip kings <lb/>
            and not to conquer them. This, it is said, was urged by <lb/>
            one of the prætors, Lucius Quintus,* by whom they were <lb/>
            mainly persuaded to pass a decree to send persons to super­ <lb/>
            sede Lucullus in his province. They also decreed that <lb/>
            many of the soldiers under Lucullus should be released <lb/>
            from service.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. To these causes, in themselves so weighty, <lb/>
            there was added another that, most of all, ruined the <lb/>
            measures of Lucullus; and this was Publius Clodius, a <lb/>
            violent man, and full of arrogance and audacity. He was <lb/>
            the brother of the wife of Lucullus, a woman of most <lb/>
            dissolute habits, whom he was also accused of debauching. <lb/>
            At this time he was serving with Lucullus, and he did <lb/>
            not get all the distinction to which he thought himself <lb/>
            entitled. In fact, he aspired to the first rank, and, as there <lb/>
            were many preferred before him, in consequence of his <note type="footnote"> * This is the same person who is mentioned in c. 5. The Roman <lb/>
            name is Quinctius, which is corrupted in the MSS. of Plutarch. This <lb/>
            Lucius was tribune of the Plebs B.C. 74, the year of the consulship of <lb/>
            Lucullus. In this chapter Plutarch calls him one of the Prætors <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ένα τῶν στρατηγῶν</foreign>), which Kaltwasser has translated "one of the . <lb/>
            tribunes of the people." </note> <note type="footnote"> 2H2 </note> <lb/>

            character, he secretly endeavoured to win the favour of <lb/>
            Fimbria's army, and to excite the soldiers against Lucullus. <lb/>
            by circulating among them words well suited to those <lb/>
            who were ready to hear them, and were not unaccustomed <lb/>
            to be courted. These were the men whom Fimbria had <lb/>
            persuaded to kill the consul Flaccus, and to choose him­ <lb/>
            self for their general. Accordingly, they gladly listened <lb/>
            to Clodius, and called him the soldier's friend, for he <lb/>
            pretended to feel indignant at their treatment. " Was <lb/>
            there never to be an end," he would say, " to so many wars <lb/>
            and dangers, and were they to wear out their lives in <lb/>
            fighting with every nation, and wandering over every <lb/>
            country, and getting no equivalent for so much service, but, <lb/>
            instead thereof, were they to convoy waggons and camels <lb/>
            of Lucullus, loaded with cups of gold, set with precious <lb/>
            stones, while the soldiers of Pompeius were now living as <lb/>
            citizens,. and with their wives and children were sitting <lb/>
            quiet in the enjoyment of fertile lands and cities, though <lb/>
            they had not driven Mithridates and Tigranes into un­ <lb/>
            inhabited wildernesses, nor pulled down the palaces of <lb/>
            Asia, but had fought with exiles in Iberia, and runaway <lb/>
            slaves in Italy ? Why, then, if there is never to be an <lb/>
            end of our service, do we not reserve what remains of our <lb/>
            bodies and our lives for a general who considers the wealth <lb/>
            of the soldiers his chief glory ? " By such causes as these <lb/>
            the army of Lucullus was corrupted, and his soldiers refused <lb/>
            to follow him either against Tigranes or against Mithri­ <lb/>

            alleging the winter as an excuse, the soldiers lingered in <lb/>
            Gordyene, expecting every moment that Pompeius, or some <lb/>
            other commander,† would arrive to supersede Lucullus. <note type="footnote">* This, I think, is the sense of the passage, to which Reiske gives <lb/>

          <p>XXXV. But when news came that Mithridates had <lb/>
            defeated Fabius,* and was marching against Sornatius <lb/>
            and Triarius, through very shame the soldiers followed <lb/>
            Lucullus. Triarius, being ambitious to snatch the victory <lb/>
            which he thought was in his grasp, before Lucullus, who <lb/>
            was near, should arrive, was defeated in a great battle. <lb/>
            It is said that above seven thousand Romans fell, among <lb/>
            whom were a hundred and fifty centurions, and twenty- <lb/>
            four tribunes ; and Mithridates took the camp. Lucullus <lb/>
            arrived a few days after, and secreted from the soldiers <lb/>
            Triarius, whom in their passion they were looking for; <lb/>
            and, as Mithridates was not willing to fight, but was <lb/>
            waiting for Tigranes, who was already coming down with <lb/>
            a large force, Lucullus determined to march back, and to <lb/>
            fight with Tigranes before he and Mithridates could unite. <lb/>
            As he was on his march the soldiers of Fimbria mutinied, <lb/>
            and left their ranks, considering that they were released <lb/>
            from service by the decree of the Senate, and that Lucullus <lb/>
            had no longer any right to the command, now that the <lb/>
            provinces were assigned to others. Upon this there was <lb/>
            nothing, however inconsistent with his dignity, which <lb/>
            Lucullus did not submit to do-supplicating the soldiers <lb/>
            individually, and going about from tent to tent in humble <lb/>
            manner, and with tears in his eyes, and sometimes even <lb/>
            faking the soldiers by the hand. But they rejected his <lb/>
            proffered hand, and threw down before him their empty <lb/>
            purses, and told him to fight with the enemy himself, for <lb/>
            he was the only person who knew how to get rich from <lb/>
            them. However, at the request of the rest of the army, <lb/>
            the soldiers of Fimbria were constrained, and agreed to <lb/>
            stay to the end of summer, and if, in the meantime, no <lb/>
            enemy should come down to fight them, they were then <lb/>
            to be released. Lucullus was of necessity obliged to ac­ <lb/>
            quiesce in this, or else to be left alone, and give up the <lb/>
            country to the barbarians. He therefore kept the soldiers <lb/>
            together, without making any further attempt to force <lb/>
            them, or lead them out to battle, for he was well content <lb/>
            if they would stay with him, and he allowed Cappadocia <lb/>
            to be ravaged by Tigranes, and Mithridates to resume his <note type="footnote"> * Compare Dion Cassius, 35, c. 10, &amp;c.; and Appian, c. 88, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>

            arrogance, as to whom he had written to the Senate, to <lb/>
            inform them that he was completely subdued; and the <lb/>
            commissioners * were now with him who had been sent <lb/>
            to settle the affairs of Pontus, on the supposition that the <lb/>
            country was completely in the power of the Romans. <lb/>
            Indeed, the commissioners were now witnesses that Lucul­ <lb/>
            lus was not his own master, but was treated with con­ <lb/>
            tumely and insult by the soldiers, who carried their <lb/>
            audacity towards their commander so far, that, at the <lb/>
            close of the summer, they put on their armour, and draw­ <lb/>
            ing their swords, challenged to battle the enemy who were <lb/>
            no longer there, but had already moved off. After utter­ <lb/>
            ing the war shout, and flourishing their swords in the air, <lb/>
            they left the camp, declaring that the time was up which <lb/>
            they had agreed to stay with Lucullus. The rest of the <lb/>
            soldiers were summoned by Pompeius by letter, for he <lb/>
            had been appointed to the command t in the war against <lb/>
            Mithridates and Tigranes, by the favour of the people, <lb/>
            and through the influence of the demagogues; though the <lb/>
            Senate and the nobles thought that Lucullus was wronged, <lb/>
            inasmuch as he was not superseded in a war, but in a <lb/>
            triumph; and it was not the command, but the h nours <lb/>
            of the command that he was compelled to divest himself <lb/>
            of, and to surrender to others.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. But it appeared a still greater wrong to those <lb/>
            who were with Lucullus in Asia, that Lucullus had not <lb/>
            the power either to reward or punish for anything that <lb/>
            was done in the war; nor did Pompeius allow any person <lb/>
            to go to him, nor to pay any attention to the orders and <lb/>
            regulations that he was making in concert with the ten <lb/>
            commissioners, but he obstructed him by publishing counter <lb/>
            edicts, and by the fear which he inspired from having a <lb/>
            larger force. However, their friends agreed to bring them <lb/>
            together, and they met in a village of Galatia, where they <note type="footnote"> * When a country was conquered and it was intended to make of <lb/>

            saluted one another in a friendly manner, and each con­ <lb/>
            gratulated the other on his victories. Lucullus was the <lb/>
            elder, but Pompeius had the greater reputation, because <lb/>
            be had oftener had the command, and enjoyed two <lb/>
            triumphs. Fasces, wreathed with bay,* were carried <lb/>
            before both generals in token of their victories. But, as <lb/>
            Pompeius had made a long march through a country <lb/>
            without water and arid, the bays upon his fasces were <lb/>
            withered, which the lictors of Lucullus observing, in a <lb/>
            friendly manner gave them bays out of their own, which <lb/>
            were fresh and green. And this the friends of Pompeius <lb/>
            interpreted as a good omen; for, in fact, the exploits of <lb/>
            Lucullus served to set off the command of Pompeius. But <lb/>
            the conference t resulted in no amicable arrangement, and <lb/>
            they separated with increased aversion towards each other. <lb/>
            Pompeius also annulled the regulations of Lucullus, and <lb/>
            he took off with him all the soldiers with the exception <lb/>
            of sixteen hundred, whom he left to Lucullus for his <lb/>
            triumph; and even these did not follow him very <lb/>
            willingly : so ill suited was the temper of Lucullus, or so <lb/>
            unlucky was he in securing that which, of all things, is <lb/>
            the chief and greatest in a general; for, if he had pos­ <lb/>
            sessed this quality, with the other many and great virtues <lb/>
            that he had, courage, activity, judgment, and justice, the <lb/>
            Roman empire would not have had the Euphrates for its <lb/>
            limit, but the remotest parts of Asia, and the Hyrkanian <lb/>
            Sea ; ‡ for all the other nations had already been defeated <lb/>
            by Tigranes, and the Parthian power was not such as it <lb/>

            attacks of the Armenians. But it seems to me that the <lb/>
            services of Lucullus to his country were less than the <lb/>
            harm he did it in other things; for his trophies in <note type="footnote"> * This is the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">δάφνη</foreign>, and the Roman Laurus, which is in­ <lb/>

            Armenia, which were erected on the borders of Partliia, <lb/>
            and Tigranocerta, and Nisibis, and the great wealth that <lb/>
            was brought from these cities to Rome, and the display of <lb/>
            the diadem of Tigranes in his triumph, urged Crassus to <lb/>
            attack Asia, and to think that the barbarians were only <lb/>
            spoil and booty, and nothing else. But Crassus soon felt <lb/>
            the Parthian arrows, and so proved that Lucullus had got <lb/>
            the advantage over the enemy, not through their want <lb/>
            of skill or cowardice, but by his own courage and ability. <lb/>
            This, however, happened afterwards.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. When Lucullus returned to Rome, first of <lb/>
            all he found that his brother Marcus was under prosecu­ <lb/>
            tion by Caius Memmius,* for what he had done in his <lb/>
            quæstorship at the command of Sulla. Upon Marcus <lb/>
            being acquitted, Memmius transferred his attack to Lu­ <lb/>
            oullus himself, and endeavoured to excite the people against <lb/>
            him, and persuaded them not to give him a triumph, on <lb/>
            the ground that he had appropriated to himself much of <lb/>
            the spoils, and had prolonged the war. Now that Lu­ <lb/>
            cullus was involved in a great struggle, the first and most <lb/>
            powerful men, mingling themselves among the tribes, by <lb/>
            much entreaty and exertion with difficulty persuaded the <lb/>
            people to allow Lucullus to have a triumph; t not, however, <lb/>
            like some, a triumph which was striking and bustling, from <note type="footnote"> * This Caius Memmius was tribune of the Plebs in the year B.O. 66, <lb/>
            in which year Lucullus returned to Rome. Memmius was not satisfied <lb/>
            with prosecuting M. Lucullus; he revenged himself for his failure by <lb/>
            debauching his wife, to which Cicero alludes in the following passage <lb/>
            (.Ad Attic. i. 18): “ C. Memmius has inhibited the wife of M. Lucullus <lb/>
            in his own sacred rites. Menelaus (M. Lucullus) did not like this, <lb/>
            and has divorced his wife. Though that shepherd of Ida insulted <lb/>
            Menelaus only; this Paris of ours has not considered either that <lb/>
            Menelaus or Agamemnon should be free." Cicero is here alluding <lb/>
            to the opposition which Memmius made to the triumph of L. Lucullus. <lb/>
            Memmius was a man of ability, but of dissolute habits. He was accused <lb/>
            of bribery at the consular election, and being convicted, retired to <lb/>
            Athens. Several letters of Cicero to him are still extant. Lucretius <lb/>
            dedicated his poem to Memmius. See the Note of Manutius on <lb/>
            Cicero, Ad Familiares, xiii. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> Orelli (Onomastic. C. Memmius Gemillus) refers to Cicero, Pro Balbo, <lb/>
            o. 2, to show that this Memmius was quæstor under Pompeius in his <lb/>
            Spanish campaign. But according to Plutarch, a Memmius fell in <lb/>
            battle in this war (Life of Sertorius, c. 21). </note><note type="footnote"> t Lucullus triumphed B.O. 63, in the consulship of Cicero. (Cicero <lb/>

            the length of the procession, and the quantity of things <lb/>
            that were displayed, but he decorated the circus of Flaminius <lb/>
            with the arms of the enemy, of which he had a great <lb/>
            quantity, and with the royal engines of war ; and it was <lb/>
            a spectacle in itself far from being contemptible. In the <lb/>
            procession a few of the mailed horsemen, and ten of the <lb/>
            scythe-bearing chariots moved along, with sixty of the <lb/>
            king's friends and generals, and a hundred and ten <lb/>
            brazen-beaked ships of war also were carried in the pro­ <lb/>
            cession, and a gold statue of Mithridates six feet high, <lb/>
            and a shield ornamented with precious stones, and twenty <lb/>
            litters loaded with silver vessels, and two-and-thirty <lb/>
            loaded with golden cups, armour, and money. All this <lb/>
            was carried on men's shoulders; but there were eight <lb/>
            mules that bore golden couches, and fifty-six carried <lb/>
            silver in bars, and a hundred and seven others carried <lb/>
            silver coin to the amount of near two million seven hundred <lb/>
            thousand pieces. There were also tablets, on which was <lb/>
            written the amount of money that Lucullus had supplied <lb/>
            Pompeius with for the pirates' war, and the amount that he <lb/>
            had paid to those who had the care of the eerarium; and <lb/>
            besides this, it was added that every soldier received nine <lb/>
            hundred and fifty drachmas. After this Lucullus feasted <lb/>
            all the city in a splendid style, and the surrounding <lb/>
            villages which the Romans call Vici.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. After Lucullus had divorced Clodia, who <lb/>
            was a loose and unprincipled woman, he married Servilia,* <lb/>
            the sister of Cato, but neither was this a happy marriage ; <lb/>
            for he thus escaped only one of the misfortunes that <lb/>
            resulted ."rom his union with Clodia, the scandal about her <lb/>
            brothers: in every other respect Servilia was as abominable <note type="footnote"> * Servilia was the half sister of M. Porcius Cato the younger. <lb/>
            Livia, the daughter of M. Livius Drusus, who was consul B.C. 112 and <lb/>
            the sister of the tribune M. Livius Drusus B C. 91, was married to <lb/>
            M. Porcius Cato, by whom she became the mother of M. Porcius Cato <lb/>
            the younger, or of Utica. She was divorced from Cato, and then <lb/>
            married Q. Servilius Cæpio, the brother of the Cæpio who was defeated <lb/>
            by the Cimbri. Some critics made Cæpio her first husband. She had <lb/>
            by Cæpio a daughter Set villa, who married L. Lucullus, and another <lb/>
            Servilia, who married M. Junius Brutus and was the mother of M. Junius <lb/>
            Brutus, one of the assassins of C. Julius Cæsar. Plutarch iu various <lb/>
            passages clearly distinguishes these two women, though some critics <lb/>
            think there was only one Servilia. Cæsar was a lover of the mother of <lb/>
            Brutus, and he gave her an estate at Naples. (Cicero, Ad Attic. xiv. 21.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="474"/>
            as Clodia and a licentious woman, and yet Lucullus was <lb/>
            obliged to bear with her from regard to Cato; but at last <lb/>
            he put her away. Lucullus had raised the highest ex­ <lb/>
            pectations in the Senate, who hoped to find in him a <lb/>
            counterpoise to the overbearing conduct of Pompeius and <lb/>
            a defender of the aristocracy,. inasmuch as he had the <lb/>
            advantage of great reputation and influence; but he dis­ <lb/>
            appointed these hopes and gave up political affairs, either <lb/>
            because he saw that they were already in a difficult posi­ <lb/>
            tion and not in a healthy state, or, as some say, because <lb/>
            he was satisfied with glory, and wished to fall back to <lb/>
            an easy and luxurious life, after his many contests <lb/>
            and dangers, which had not been followed by the most <lb/>
            fortunate of results. Some commend him for making <lb/>
            such a change, whereby he avoided what had befallen <lb/>
            Marius, who, after his Cimbrian victories and that great <lb/>
            and glorious success, did not choose to dedicate himself to <lb/>
            honour so great and to be an object of admiration, but through <lb/>
            insatiate desire of glory and power, though an old man, <lb/>
            entered into political warfare with young men, and so <lb/>
            ended his career in dreadful acts, and in sufferings more <lb/>
            dreadful than acts; and they say that Cicero also would <lb/>
            have had a better old age if he had withdrawn from public <lb/>
            life after the affair of Catiline, and Scipio after he had <lb/>
            - added the conquest of Numantia to that of Carthage, if he <lb/>
            had then stopped ; for there is a close to a political period <lb/>
            also, and political contests as well as those of athletes are <lb/>
            censured when a man's vigour and prime have failed him. <lb/>
            But Crassus and Pompeius sneered t at Lucullus for giving <lb/>
            himself up to pleasure and extravagant living, as if a <lb/>
            luxurious life was not more unsuitable to persons of his <lb/>
            age than affairs of state and military command. <note type="footnote"> * This is the word of Plutarch (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τῇς ἀριστοκρατιᾶ</foreign>), which he seems <lb/>
            to use here like the Roman “ Nobilitas" to express the body of the <lb/>
            Nobiles or Optimates, as they were called by a term which resembled <lb/>

            to say that Lucullus thought that luxury was more suitable to his years <lb/>
            than war or affairs of state, and that Pompeius and Crassus (littered <lb/>

          <p>XXXIX. Now in the life of Lucullus, as in an ancient <lb/>
            comedy, we may read, in the first part, of political measures <lb/>
            and military command, and, in the last part, of drinking <lb/>
            and feasts, and hardly anything but revels, and torches, <lb/>
            and all kinds of amusement; for I reckon among amuse­ <lb/>
            ments, expensive buildings, and construction of ambu­ <lb/>
            latories and baths, and still more paintings and statues, <lb/>
            and eagerness about works of this kind, all which he got <lb/>
            together at great cost, and to this end spent profusely the <lb/>
            wealth which he had accumulated to a large and splendid <lb/>
            amount in his military command; for, even now, when <lb/>
            luxury of this kind has increased, the gardens of Lucullus <lb/>
            are reckoned among the most sumptuous of the imperial <lb/>
            gardens.- But with respect to his works on the sea- <lb/>
            coast and in the neighbourhood of Neapolis, where he <lb/>
            suspended as it were hills by digging great tunnels,† <lb/>
            and threw around his dwelling-places circular pieces of <lb/>
            sea-water and channels for the breeding of fish, and built <lb/>
            houses in the sea, Tubero the Stoic, ‡ on seeing them, <lb/>
            called him Xerxes in a toga. He had also country <lb/>

            allowed by the emperor to choose his own way of dying. In these <lb/>

            cannot be the contemporary of Lucullus, and Plutarch either means <lb/>

            latories, which Pompeius on visiting found fault with <lb/>
            Lucullus, that he had arranged his house in the best <lb/>
            way for summer, but had made it unfit to live in during <lb/>
            the winter. On which Lucullus said, with a smile, "You <lb/>
            think, then, I have less sense than the cranes and storks, <lb/>
            and do not change my residence according to the seasons." <lb/>
            On one occasion, when a prætor was ambitious to signalize <lb/>
            himself in the matter of a public spectacle, and asked of <lb/>
            Lucullus some purple cloaks for the dress of a chorus, <lb/>
            Lucullus replied, that he would see if he had any and <lb/>
            would give them to him; and the day after he apked the <lb/>
            prætor how many he wanted. The prætor said that a <lb/>
            hundred would be enough, on which Lucullus told him <lb/>
            to take twice as many; in allusion to which the poet <lb/>
            Flaccus * has remarked, that he does not consider a man <lb/>
            to be rich, if the property that he cares not for and knows <lb/>
            nothing about is not more than that which he sees.</p>
          <p>XL. The daily meals of Lucullus were accompanied <lb/>
            with all the extravagance of newly-acquired wealth; for <lb/>
            it was not only by dyed coverlets for his couches, and <lb/>
            cups set with precious stones, and choruses and dramatic <lb/>
            entertainments, but by abundance of all kinds of food <lb/>
            and dainty dishes, curiously prepared, that he made him­ <lb/>
            self an object of admiration to the uninstructed. Now <lb/>
            Pompeius gained a good reputation in an illness that <lb/>
            lie had; for the physician had ordered him to eat a <lb/>
            thrush, and, on his domestics telling him that a thrush <lb/>
            could not be found in the summer season except at the <lb/>
            house of Lucullus, where they were fed, Pompeius would <lb/>
            not consent to have one got from there; but remarking to <lb/>
            his physician, "What, if Lucullus were not so luxurious, <lb/>
            could not Pompeius live ?" bade them get for him some­ <lb/>
            thing else that could be easily procured. Cato, who was <lb/>
            his friend and connected with him by marriage, was so <lb/>
            much annoyed at his life and habits that, on one occasion, <lb/>
            when a young man had delivered in the senate a tedious <lb/>
            and lengthy discourse, quite out of season, on frugality and <lb/>
            temperance, Cato got up and said, Won<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign>t you stop, you who <lb/>
            are as rich as Crassus, and live like Lucullus, and speak <note type="footnote"> * This is the story which Q. Horatius Flaccus tells in his Epistolac, <lb/>
            Lib. i. Ep. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="477"/>
            like Cato?" Some say that a remark to this effect was <lb/>
            made, but that it was not by Cato.</p>
          <p>XLI. That Lucullus was not merely pleased with this <lb/>
            mode of living, but prided himself upon it, appears from <lb/>
            the anecdotes that are recorded. It is said, that he feasted <lb/>
            for many days some Greeks who visited Rome, and that <lb/>
            they, feeling as Greeks would do * on the occasion, began <lb/>
            to be ashamed and to decline the invitation, on the ground <lb/>
            that he was daily incurring so much expense on their <lb/>
            account ; but Lucullus said to them with a smile, “ It is <lb/>
            true, Greeks, that this is partly done on your account, but <lb/>
            mainly on the account of Lucullus." One day, when he <lb/>
            was supping alone, a single course and a moderate repast <lb/>
            had been prepared for him, at which he was angry, and <lb/>
            called for the slave whose business it was to look after <lb/>
            such matters. The slave said, that he did not suppose that <lb/>
            he would want anything costly, as no guest was invited. <lb/>
            “ What sayest thou ? " said Lucullus, “ didst thou not know <lb/>
            that to-day Lucullus sups with Lucullus ?" Now, this <lb/>
            matter being much talked of in the city, as one might <lb/>
            expect, there came up to Lucullus, as he was idling in the <lb/>
            Forum, Cicero and Pompeius, of whom Cicero was among <lb/>
            his most intimate friends; but between Lucullus and <lb/>
            Pompeius there was some difference, arising out of the <lb/>
            affair of the command in the Mithridatic war, and yet they <lb/>
            were accustomed to associate and talk together frequently <lb/>
            in a friendly manner. Accordingly, Cicero saluted him, <lb/>
            and asked him how he was disposed to receive visitors, to <lb/>
            which Lucullus replied, “ Exceedingly well," and invited <lb/>
            them to pay him a visit. “We wish," said Cicero, “ to sup <lb/>
            with you to-day, just in the same way as if preparation <lb/>
            were made for yourself only." Lucullus began to make <lb/>
            some difficulty, and to ask them to allow him to name <lb/>
            another day; but they said they would not, nor would they <lb/>
            let him speak to his servants, that he might not have the <lb/>
            opportunity of ordering anything more than what was <lb/>
            preparing for himself. However, at his request, they <lb/>
            allowed him just to tell one of his slaves in their presence, <note type="footnote"> * This is one of many like indications in Plutarch of his good <lb/>
            opinion of his countrymen. Compare the life of Crass us, c. 8, where <lb/>
            he is speaking of Spartacus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="478"/>
            that lie would sup on that day in the Apollo; for this was <lb/>
            the name of one of his costly apartments. This trick of <lb/>
            Lucullus was not understood by his guests; for it is said <lb/>
            that to every banqueting-room there was assigned the cost <lb/>
            of the feast there, and every room had its peculiar style of <lb/>
            preparation and entertainment, so that when the slaves <lb/>
            heard in which room their master intended to sup, they <lb/>
            also knew what was to be the cost of the supper and the <lb/>
            kind of decoration and arrangement. Now, Lucullus was <lb/>
            accustomed to sup in the Apollo at the cost of fifty <lb/>
            thousand drachmae, and this being the cost of the enter­ <lb/>
            tainment on the present occasion, Pompeius and Cicero <lb/>
            were surprised at the rapidity with which the banquet had <lb/>
            been got ready and the costliness of the entertainment. <lb/>
            In this way, then, Lucullus used his wealth, capriciously, <lb/>
            just as if it were a captive slave and a barbarian.</p>
          <p>XLII. What he did as to his collection of books is <lb/>
            worth notice and mention. He got together a great number <lb/>
            of books which were well transcribed, and the mode in <lb/>
            which they were used was more honourable to him than <lb/>
            the acquisition of them; for the libraries were open to <lb/>
            all, and the walking-places which surrounded them, and <lb/>
            the reading rooms were accessible to the Greeks without <lb/>
            any restriction, and they went there as to an abode of <lb/>
            the Muses, and spent the day there in company with one <lb/>
            another, gladly betaking themselves to the libraries from <lb/>
            their other occupations. Lucullus himself often spent some <lb/>
            time there with the visitors, walking about in the ambu­ <lb/>
            latories, and he used to talk there with men engaged in <lb/>
            public affairs on such matters as they might choose; and <lb/>
            altogether his house was a home and a Greek prytaneum * <lb/>
            to those who came to Rome. He was fond of philosophy <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch's allusion would be intelligible to a Greek, but hardly so <lb/>
            to a Roman, unless he was an educated man. A prytaneum in a <lb/>
            Greek city was a building belonging to the community, on the altar of <lb/>
            which was kept the ever-burning fire. In the prytaneum of Athens, <lb/>
            entertainments were given both to foreign ambassadors and to citizens <lb/>
            who I ad merited the distinction of dining in the prytaneum, a privilege <lb/>
            that was given sometimes for life, and sometimes for a limited period. <lb/>
            As the town-hall of any community is in a manner the common home <lb/>
            of the citizens, so Plutaich compares the house of Lucullus, which was <lb/>
            open to all strangers, with the public hall of a man<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign>s own city. </note> <lb/>

            generally, and well disposed to every sect, and friendly to <lb/>
            them all; but from the first he particularly admired and <lb/>
            loved the Academy,. not that which is called the New <lb/>
            Academy, though the sect was then flourishing by the <lb/>
            propagation of the doctrines of Karneades by Philo, but <lb/>
            Old Academy, which at that time had for its head a <lb/>
            persuasive man and a powerful speaker, Antiochus of <lb/>
            Askalon, whom Lucullus eagerly sought for his friend <lb/>
            and companion, and opposed to the followers of Philo, of <lb/>
            whom Cicero also was one. Cicero wrote an excellent <lb/>
            treatise upon the doctrines of this sect, in which he made <lb/>
            Lucullus t the speaker in favour of the doctrine of com­ <lb/>
            prehension ‡ and himself the speaker on the opposite side. <note type="footnote"> * Plato established his school in the Academia, a grove near <lb/>
            Athens; whence the name of the place, Academia, was used to signify <lb/>
            the opinions of the school of Plato and of those schools which were <lb/>
            derived from his. Speusippus, the nephew of Plato, was his successor <lb/>
            in the Academy, and he was followed by Xenokrates, and other teachers <lb/>
            who belong to the Old Academy, as it is called, among whom were <lb/>
            Polemo, Krates, and Krantor. The New Academy, that is, the philoso­ <lb/>
            phical sect so called, was established by Arcesilaus; who was succeeded <lb/>
            by several teachers of little note. Karneades, a native of Cyrene, the <lb/>
            man mentioned by Plutarch, was he who gave to the New Academy <lb/>
            its chief repute. Philo was not the immediate pupil of Karneades. He <lb/>
            was a native of Larissa, and during the war with Mithridates he came <lb/>
            to Rome, where he delivered lectures. Cicero was one of his hearers, <lb/>
            and often mentions him. Philo according to Cicero (Academ. i. 4) <lb/>
            denies that there were two Academies. Antiochus, of Askalon, was a <lb/>
            pupil of Philo, but after he had founded a school of his own he <lb/>
            attempted to reconcile the doctrines of the Old Academy with those <lb/>
            of the Peripatetics and Stoics; and he became an opponent of the <lb/>
            New Academy. Antiochus was with Lucullus in Egypt. (Cicero, <lb/>
            Academ. Prior. ii. c. 4.) The usual division of the Academy is into <lb/>
            the Old and New; but other divisions also were made. The first and <lb/>
            oldest was the school of Plato, the second or middle was that of <lb/>
            Arkesilaus, and the third was that of Karneades and Kleitomachus, <lb/>
            Some make a fourth, the school of Philo and Charmidas; and a fifth, <lb/>
            which was that of Antiochus. (Sextus Empiricus, Pyrrh. Hypot. i. <lb/>
            220.) </note><note type="footnote"> t This is the Second Book of the Academica Priora, in which <lb/>
            Lucullus, Catulus, Cicero, and Hortensius are represented as discuss­ <lb/>

            The book is entitled ‘Lucullus.' Lucullus and Cicero <lb/>
            were, as I have said, great friends, and associated in their <lb/>
            political views, for Lucullus had not entirely withdrawn <lb/>
            from public affairs, though he had immediately on his <lb/>
            return to Rome surrendered to Crassus and Cato the <lb/>
            ambition and the struggle to be the first man in the state <lb/>
            and have the greatest power, considering that the struggle <lb/>
            was not free from danger and great mortification; for <lb/>
            those who looked with jealousy on the power of Pompeius <lb/>
            put Crassus and Cato at the head of their party in the <lb/>
            Senate, when Lucullus declined to take the lead, but <lb/>
            Lucullus used to go to the Forum to support his friends, and <lb/>
            to the Senate whenever it was necessary to put a check on <lb/>
            any attempt or ambitious design of Pompeius. The arrange­ <lb/>
            ments which Pompeius made after his conquest of the <lb/>
            kings, Lucullus contrived to nullify, and when Pompeius <lb/>
            proposed a distribution of lands * Lucullus with the assist­ <note type="footnote">from what are true, how, it is asked, can we say of anyone that he has <lb/>
            come to a conclusion or discovered anything ?”(Academ. Prior. ii. <lb/>
            c. 9.) The doctrine as to the impossibility of knowing anything, as <lb/>
            taught by Karneades, is explained by Sextus Empiricus (Advers. <lb/>
            Mathematicos, vii. 159). The doctrine of the incomprehensible nature <lb/>
            of things, that there is nothing certain to be collected either from the <lb/>
            sense or the understanding, that there is no <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατάληψις</foreign> (comprehensio), <lb/>
            comprehension, may he collected from the passages given in Hitter and <lb/>
            Preller, Hi8toria Philosophiæ Græco-Romanæ, p. 396, Academic <lb/>
            Novi. </note><note type="footnote"> * Dion Cassius (37, c. 49) states that during the consulship of Lucius <lb/>
            Afranius and Q. Metellus Celer B.C. 60, Pompeius, who had brought <lb/>
            about their election, attempted to carry a law for the distribution of <lb/>
            lands among his soldiers and the ratification of all his acts during his <lb/>
            command. This is the Agrarian Law which was proposed by the <lb/>
            tribune Flavius, but opposed by the Senate. (Cicero. Ad Attic. i. 19.) <lb/>
            Afranius was, if we may trust Cicero, a contemptible fellow; and <lb/>
            Metellus now quarrelled with Pompeius, because Pompeius had divorced <lb/>
            Mucia, the sister of Metellus, as Dion calls her, for incontinence during <lb/>
            his absence. Cicero says that the divorce was much approved. Mucia <lb/>
            was not the sister of Metellus; but she was probably a kinswoman. <lb/>
            The divorce, however, could only have been considered a slight affair; <lb/>
            for Mucia was incontinent, and divorces were no rare things at Rome. <lb/>
            The real ground of the opposition of Metellus to Pompeius was fear of <lb/>
            his assumption of still further power. From this time Horatius (Carm. <lb/>
            ii. 1, “ Motum ex Metello Consule civicum ") dates the beginning of the <lb/>
            Civil Wars of his period. See Life of Pompeius, o. 46, and of Cato the <lb/>
            Younger, c. 31. </note> <lb/>

            ance of Cato prevented it from being made, which drew <lb/>
            Pompeius to seek the friendship of Crassus and Cæsar, or <lb/>
            rather to enter into a combination with them, and by <lb/>
            filling the city with arms and soldiers he got his measures <lb/>
            ratified after driving out of the Forum the partisans of Cato <lb/>
            and Lucullus. The nobles being indignant at these pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, the party of Pompeius produced one Vettius,* <lb/>
            whom, as they said, they had detected in a design on the <lb/>
            life of Pompeius. When Vettius was examined before the <lb/>
            Senate, he accused others, and before the popular assembly <lb/>
            he named Lucullus as the person by whom he had been <lb/>
            suborned to murder Pompeius. But nobody believed him, <lb/>
            and it soon became clear that the man had been brought <lb/>
            forward by the partisans of Pompeius to fabricate a false <lb/>
            charge, and to criminate others, and the fraud was made <lb/>
            still more apparent, when a few days after the dead body <lb/>
            of Vettius was thrown out of the prison; for, though it was <lb/>
            given out that he died a natural death t there were marks <lb/>
            of strangulation and violence on the body, and it was <lb/>
            the opinion that he had been put to death by those who <lb/>
            suborned him.</p>
          <p>XLIII. This induced Lucullus still more to with­ <lb/>
            draw from public affairs; and when Cicero was banished <lb/>
            from Rome, and Cato ‡ was sent to Cyprus, he retired <note type="footnote"> * It is Brettius in the text of Plutarch, which is evidently a mis­ <lb/>
            take for Bettius, that is, Vettius. This affair of Vettius cannot be <lb/>
            cleared up. He had been an informer in the matter of Catiline's con­ <lb/>
            spiracy, and he had attempted to implicate C. Julius Cæsar in it: <lb/>
            which of the two parties caused him to be assassinated is doubtful. <lb/>
            This affair of Vettius is spoken of by Cicero, Ad Attic. ii. 24, Dion <lb/>
            Cassius, 38, c. 9, Appian, Civil Wars. ii. 12. The history of this affair of <lb/>
            Vettius is given by Drumann, Geschichte Roms, ii. 334, P. Clodius. <lb/>
            t Kaltwasser translates it " he put himself to death :” perhaps the <lb/>
            words may have either meaning. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See the Life of Cicerc, c. 31, and Life of Cato, o. 34. <lb/>
            Cicero was banished B.C. 58, and Cato was sent to Cyprus in the <lb/>
            same year. Lucullus probably did not survive beyond the year B.O. 56. <lb/>
            He was older than Cn. Pompeius Magnus, who was born B.C. 106. <lb/>
            The character of Lucullus may be collected from Plutarch. lie <lb/>
            was a man of talent and of taste, a brave soldier, a skilful general and <lb/>
            a man of letters. Cicero in the first chapter of the second book of the <lb/>
            Academica Priora has passed a high eulogium on him. He was fond <lb/>
            of wealth and luxury, but humane and of a mild temper. He was no <lb/>
            match for the cunning of Pomperus, or the daring temper of Cæsar; </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="482"/>
            altogether. Before he died, it is said that his understand­ <lb/>
            ing was disordered and gradually failed. Cornelius Nepos <lb/>
            says that Lucullus did not die of old age nor of disease, but <lb/>
            that his health was destroyed by potions given him by <lb/>
            Callisthenes, one of his freedmen, and that the potions were <lb/>
            given him by Callisthenes with the view of increasing his <lb/>
            master<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign>s affection for him, a power which the potions were <lb/>
            supposed to have, but they so far disturbed and destroyed <lb/>
            his reason, that during his lifetime his brother managed his <lb/>
            affairs. However, when Lucullus died, the people grieved <lb/>
            just as much as if he had died at the height of his military <lb/>
            distinction and his political career, and they flocked together <lb/>
            and had his body carried to the Forum by the young men of <lb/>
            the highest rank and were proceeding forcibly to have it <lb/>
            interred in the Campus Martius where Sulla was interred ; <lb/>
            but, as nobody had expected this, and it was not easy to <lb/>
            make the requisite preparations, the brother of Lucullus <lb/>
            prayed and prevailed on the people to allow the funeral <lb/>
            ceremony to take place on the estate at Tusculum, where <lb/>
            preparations for it had been made. Nor did he long survive ; <lb/>
            but as in age and reputation he came a little after Lucullus, <lb/>
            so he died shortly after him, a most affectionate brother. <note type="footnote"> and he was not cruel enough to have acted with the decision which the <lb/>
            troublesome times required that he just lived to see. The loss of his <lb/>
            History of the Marsic War is much to be lamented. It is singular that <lb/>
            Sulla's Memoirs which he revised, and his own work, have not been <lb/>
            preserved, for we must suppose that copies of them were abundant; and <lb/>
            they were extant in Plutarch's time. </note><note type="footnote"> The history of the campaigns of Lucullus in Asia would have been <lb/>
            interesting. It is worth recording that we are indebted to him for the <lb/>
            cherry, which he brought from Cerasus (PJin. Hist. Nat. xv. 30) into <lb/>
            Europe; the name of the fruit still records the place from which it <lb/>
            was brought. As a collector of books, a lover of ornamental garden­ <lb/>
            ing and parks stocked with animals, and a friend to all the arts and <lb/>
            sciences, Lucullus was of all the luxurious Romans the most magnifi­ <lb/>
            cent and the most refined. He left a son by Servilia, whose name was <lb/>
            probably Lucius. This son joined the party of Cato and M. Brutus. <lb/>
            After the battle of Philippi B.O. 42, he was overtaken in the pursuit, <lb/>
            and put to death at the command of M. Antonius. No children of this <lb/>
            son are mentioned. </note><note type="footnote"> Marcus, the brother of Plutarch's Lucius Licinius, was consul B.C. <lb/>
            73. It is not known how long he survived his brother, but he died <lb/>
            before the commencement of the second Civil War (Vell. Paterc. <lb/>
            ii. 49), that which broke out between Cæsar and Pompeius BoC. 50. </note> <pb n="483"/>

            <title type="sub">COMPARISON OF KIMON AND LUCULLUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>LUCULLUS may be accounted especially fortunate in having <lb/>
            died when he did, so that he did not witness the ruin <lb/>
            of his country by the civil wars, but departed this life <lb/>
            while Rome, though corrupt, was yet a free state. And <lb/>
            in this he resembles Kimon more than in any other <lb/>
            point; for Kimon also died while the Greeks were at the <lb/>
            height of their prosperity, and before they had begun to <lb/>
            fight against one another. Indeed, Kimon died in his <lb/>
            camp, while acting as commander-in-chief of his country's <lb/>
            forces, at the siege of Kitium in Cyprus; not retired <lb/>
            home, as if worn out with hard service, nor yet indulging <lb/>
            in feasting and wine-drinking, as though that were the <lb/>
            end and reward of his military achievements; like that <lb/>
            life of eternal drunkenness which Plato sneers at the <lb/>
            Orphic school for promising to their disciples as their <lb/>
            reward hereafter.</p>
          <p>A peaceful retirement, and a life of literary leisure, is <lb/>
            no doubt a great comfort to a man who has withdrawn <lb/>
            himself from taking any active part in politics; but to <lb/>
            perform notable exploits with no object in view except <lb/>
            to obtain the means of enjoyment, and to pass from the <lb/>
            command of armies and the conduct of great wars to a <lb/>
            life of voluptuous indolence and luxury seems unworthy <lb/>
            of a philosopher of the Academy, or of any who profess to <lb/>
            follow the doctrine of Xenokrates, and to be rather fit for <lb/>
            a disciple of Epikurus. It is a remarkable circumstance <lb/>
            that the youth of Kimon seems to have been licentious and <lb/>
            extravagant, while that of Lucullus was spent in a sober <lb/>
            and virtuous fashion. Clearly he is the better man that <lb/>
            changes for the better; for that nature must be the more <lb/>
             <pb n="484"/>
            excellent in which vice decays, and virtue gains strength. <lb/>
            Moreover, both Kimon and Lucullus were wealthy; but <lb/>
            they made a very different use of their wealth. We can­ <lb/>
            not compare the building of the south wall of the Acropolis <lb/>
            of Athens, which was completed with the money won by <lb/>
            Kimon in the wars, with the luxurious pavilions and <lb/>
            villas washed by the sea which Lucullus erected in <lb/>
            Neapolis with the spoils he had taken from the barbarian <lb/>
            enemies of Rome. Still less can we compare the generous <lb/>
            and popular hospitality of Kimon with the Eastern pro­ <lb/>
            fusion and extravagance of Lucullus's table; for Kimon, <lb/>
            at a small expense, fed many of his countrymen daily, <lb/>
            while the other spent enormous sums to provide luxuries <lb/>
            for a small circle of friends. Yet this difference in their <lb/>
            habits may have been caused by the times in which they <lb/>
            lived; and no one can tell whether Kimon, if he had <lb/>
            returned home and spent an old age of indolence and <lb/>
            unwarlike repose, might not have even exceeded Lucullus <lb/>
            in riotous luxury ; for he was fond of wine and of society, <lb/>
            and, as has been told in his life, was greatly addicted to <lb/>
            women. But success in war or in politics so delights <lb/>
            ambitious natures that they have no time for pursuing <lb/>
            minor pleasures. Had Lucullus died at the head of his <lb/>
            army, I suppose that the most captious critic could <lb/>
            scarcely have found anything to blame in his life. So <lb/>
            much, then, for their mode of living.</p>
          <p>II. Now with regard to their warlike operations, there <lb/>
            can be no doubt that both proved themselves to be con­ <lb/>
            summate commanders, both by land and by sea; yet, as we <lb/>
            are accustomed to call those athletes who have in one day <lb/>
            been successful both in wrestling and in the pankratium <lb/>
            by the name of notable victors, so Kimon, who in one day <lb/>
            won a victory both by sea and by land, thus gaining a <lb/>
            double triumph for Greece, deserves to be given some <lb/>
            place above all other generals. Moreover, Lucullus was <lb/>
            given the chief command by his country, but Kimon won <lb/>
            for his country the honour of commanding the other <lb/>
            Greek states. Lucullus found his country in command of <lb/>
            allies, and by their aid overthrew the enemy, but Kimon <lb/>
            found his country acting under the command of others <lb/>
             <pb n="485"/>
            and by his own force of character both made Athens the <lb/>
            leading state in Greece and overcame the enemy, for he <lb/>
            drove the Persians from the sea, and persuaded the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians to resign their claims to supremacy. If <lb/>
            we are to believe it to be the greatest proof of ability in <lb/>
            a general to be loved and willingly obeyed by his soldiers, <lb/>
            then we see that Lucullus was despised by his soldiers, <lb/>
            while Kimon was est, emed and looked up to by his allies, <lb/>
            for the soldiers of Luc ullus revolted from him, while the <lb/>
            Greek states revolted from Sparta in order to join Kimon. <lb/>
            Thus the former was sent out in chief command, and <lb/>
            returned home deserted by his men, while the other, <lb/>
            though sent out to act as a subordinate under the com­ <lb/>
            mand of others, ended by returning as commander-in- <lb/>
            chief of them all, having succeeded, in spite of the greatest <lb/>
            difficulties, in obtaining three great advantages for his <lb/>
            countrymen, namely, having delivered them from the fear <lb/>
            of their enemies, having given them authority over <lb/>
            their confederates, and established a lasting friendship <lb/>
            between them and the Lacedæmonians. Both commanders <lb/>
            attempted an enormous task, the conquest of Asia; and <lb/>
            both were forced to leave their work unfinished. Kimon <lb/>
            was prevented by death, for he died at the head of an army <lb/>
            and in the full tide of success; while one cannot altogether <lb/>
            think that Lucullus was not to blame for not having <lb/>
            tried to satisfy the complaints of his soldiers, which caused <lb/>
            them to hate him so bitterly. In this point Lucullus and <lb/>
            Kimon are alike; for Kimon was often impeached by his <lb/>
            countrymen, who at last banished him by ostracism, in <lb/>
            order that, as Plato said, they might not hear his voice for <lb/>
            ten years. It seldom happens that men born to command <lb/>
            can please the people, or have anything in common with <lb/>
            them ; because they cause pain by their attempts to rule <lb/>
            and reform them, just as the bandages of a surgeon cause <lb/>
            pain to the patient, when by their means he is endeavour­ <lb/>
            ing to force back dislocated limbs into their proper position. <lb/>
            For this reason, methinks, neither Kimon nor Lucullus <lb/>
            deserve blame.</p>
          <p>III. Lucullus accomplished by far the greater exploits <lb/>
            of the two, as he marched beyond the Mount Taurus with <lb/>
             <pb n="486"/>
            an army, being the first Roman who ever did so, and also <lb/>
            crossed the river Tigris, and took and burned the royal <lb/>
            cities of Asia, Tigranocerta, Kabeira, Sinope, and Nisibis, <lb/>
            in the sight of their kings. Towards the north, he went <lb/>
            as far as the river Phasis; towards the east as far as <lb/>
            Media; and southwards as far as the Red Sea and the <lb/>
            kingdom of Arabia, subduing it all to the Roman Empire. <lb/>
            He destroyed the power of two mighty kings, and left <lb/>
            them in possession of nothing but their lives, forcing <lb/>
            them to hide themselves like hunted beasts, in trackless <lb/>
            wastes and impassable forests. A great proof of the <lb/>
            completeness of Lucullus's success is to be found in the <lb/>
            fact that the Persians soon after Kimonos death, attacked <lb/>
            the Greeks as vigorously as if they had never been <lb/>
            defeated by Kimon at all, and defeated a large Greek <lb/>
            army in Egypt; while Tigranes and Mithridates never <lb/>
            recovered from the overthrow they sustained from <lb/>
            Lucullus. Mithridates was so crushed and broken in <lb/>
            strength that he never dared to march out of his en­ <lb/>
            trenchments and fight with Pompeius, but retired to <lb/>
            Bosporus and died there; while Tigranes of his own <lb/>
            accord came into the presence of Pompeius naked and <lb/>
            unarmed, and cast down his royal diadem at his feet, <lb/>
            not flattering him for the victories which he had won, <lb/>
            but for those for which Lucullus had triumphed. He <lb/>
            was well pleased to be allowed to resume the ensigns of <lb/>
            royalty, and thereby admitted that he had before been <lb/>
            deprived of them. He, therefore, is to be held the better <lb/>
            general, as he is the better wrestler, who leaves his enemy <lb/>
            weakest for his successor to deal with. Moreover, Kimon <lb/>
            found the power of the Persians impaired, and their spirit <lb/>
            broken by the series of defeats which they had sustained <lb/>
            from Themistokles, Pausanias, and Leotychides, and was <lb/>
            easily able to conquer men whose hearts were already <lb/>
            vanquished: whereas Lucullus met Tigranes when he <lb/>
            was full of courage, and in the midst of an unbroken <lb/>
            career of victory. As for numbers, one cannot compare <lb/>
            the multitudes who were opposed to Lucullus with the <lb/>
            troops who were defeated by Kimon. Thus it appears that <lb/>
            from whatever point of view we regard them, it is hard to <lb/>
             <pb n="487"/>
            say which was the better man, especially as heaven seems <lb/>
            to have dealt so kindly with them both, in telling the <lb/>
            one what to do, and the other whats to avoid: so that it <lb/>
            seems to appear by the testimony of the gods them­ <lb/>
            selves, that they were both men of a noble and godlike <lb/>
            nature.</p>
