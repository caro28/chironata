          <p>It was observed by Dr. Drake in his Literary Hours," <lb/>
            about fifty years ago, that no version of Quintilian at all <lb/>
            adequate to the merits of the original existed in English, and <lb/>
            that to translate him throughout with energy, spirit, and <lb/>
            fidelity, would prove a task of the most arduous and difficult <lb/>
            kind; such is the beauty of his diction, and such the peculiar <lb/>
            propriety of his epithets.</p>
          <p>The difficulties alleged by Dr. Drake arc by no means <lb/>
            exaggerated; and since his time no translator has applied him­ <lb/>
            self to execute the task. The language of writers extremely <lb/>
            nice in the choice of words and the collocation of phrases, is <lb/>
            always difficult to render satisfactorily. What is graceful in <lb/>
            the original can but seldom be made graceful in a version. <lb/>
            But the present translator, if he has not entirely succeeded, <lb/>
            hopes that he has no great cause to deprecate censure. He will <lb/>
            only request that, should the student think some passages too <lb/>
            freely rendered, he will bear in mind the necessity of endea­ <lb/>
            vouring to satisfy the mere English reader; and that, if <lb/>
            the English reader finds some passages too stiff, he will con­ <lb/>
            sider the necessity for a certain degree of closeness to answer <lb/>
            the wants of the student.</p>
          <p>Of the two translations which have previously appeared in <lb/>
            English, those of Guthrie and Patsall, neither is complete, <lb/>
            whole chapters being omitted in each. In regard to fidelity, <lb/>
            Patsall is, on the whole, rather to be preferred ; but neither <note type="footnote"> b 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="IV"/>
            he nor Guthrie had the requisite scholarship to do justice to <lb/>
            their author. When they could not ascertain the sense of a <lb/>
            passage, they substituted some vague paraphrase or omitted it <lb/>
            altogether.</p>
          <p>In the following pages the whole of the original is trans­ <lb/>
            lated, and the utmost care has been taken to observe an <lb/>
            exact adherence to the sense. On every obscure or corrupt <lb/>
            passage, illustration is given in a note. The text which has <lb/>
            been used is that of Spalding, from whose valuable commen. <lb/>
            tary much useful matter has been adopted.</p>

          <p>CH. XIII. Quintilian does not give rules from which there is no de­ <lb/>
            parture ; pleaders must act according to the requisitions of their <lb/>

            Quintilian considers the art of oratory, 5 . . 137</p>
          <p>CH. XV. What rhetoric is, § 1, 2. To call it the power ofpersuading is <lb/>
            to give an insufficient definition of it, 3-9. To call it the power of <lb/>
            persuading by speech is not sufficient, 10, 11 Other definitions, 12- <lb/>
            23. That of Gorgias in Plato; that of Plato or Socrates in the <lb/>

            nition, 38 . . . . . . . 139</p>
          <p>CH. XVI. Oratory said by some to be a pernicious art, because it may <lb/>
            be perverted to bad ends, § 1—4. We might say the same of other <lb/>
            things that are allowed to be beneficial, 5, 6. Its excellences, <lb/>
            7 —16. The abundant return that it makes for cultivation <lb/>
            17—19 . . 147</p>
          <p>CH. XVII. Oratory is manifestly an art, § 1—4. Yet some have denied <lb/>
            that it is, and said that its power is wholly from nature, 5—8 <lb/>
            Examples from other arts, 9, 10. Every one that speaks is not an <lb/>
            orator, 11—13. Opinion of Aristotle, 14. Other charges against <lb/>
            oratory; that it has no peculiar subject or matter, and that <unclear>ift</unclear> <lb/>
            sometimes deceives, 15—18. Refutation of these charges, 19—21 <lb/>
            Unfairly objected to it that it has no proper end, 22—26. Not <lb/>
            pernicious because it sometimes misleads, 27—29. Another objec­ <lb/>
            tion, that it may be exerted on either side of a question, and thaw <lb/>
            it contradicts itself; answered, 30—36. Oratory is sometimes <lb/>

          <p>The grandsons of the sister of Domitian committed to the tuition of <lb/>
            Quintilian; a new motive for care in composing his work. He <lb/>
            proceeds to speak of the exordium of a speech, the statement of <lb/>
            facts, the proof, the refutation of adverse allegations, and the <lb/>

          <p>CH. I. Etymology of the word proem, § 1—3. An erroneous practice in <lb/>

            5. How the good will and attention of the judge may be gained by <lb/>
            allusion to different characters concerned in the cause, 6—19. <lb/>
            Farther observations on the same subject, 20 —27. Difference <lb/>
            between the exordium and the conclusion, 28, 29. Matters con­ <lb/>
            nected with the characters and the cause to be considered, 30—32. <lb/>
            Solicitude to be shown by the pleader; brevity to be promised; <lb/>
            accurate division of matter to be made, 33—36. To conciliate <lb/>
            the judge must be the pleader's constant object throughout his <lb/>
            speech, 37—39. Five kinds of causes, 40—41. Some make two <lb/>
            purposes of a proem, proposition and insinuation ; the latter more <lb/>
            easy for the advocate than for his client, 42—49. An unnecessary <lb/>

            respecting it, § 1-—3. A formal statement not always necessary, 4— <lb/>
            8. Those are mistaken who suppose that a statement is never neces­ <lb/>
            sary on the part of an accused person who denies the charge, 9—19. <lb/>
            What the judge already knows may sometimes be stated, 20—23. <lb/>
            The statement need not always immediately follow the exordium, <lb/>
            24—27. The practice of the schools injudiciously transferred to <lb/>
            the forum, 28—30. The statements should be clear, brief, and <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            credible, 31 —35. Of clearness, 36—39. Of brevity, 40—47. Of <lb/>
            credibility, 48 —53. The statement of facts should prepare the <lb/>
            judge for the proof of them, 54—60. Certain qualities have in­ <lb/>
            judiciously been made peculiar to the statement, 61—65. A <lb/>
            ridiculous direction that the statement should be omitted in a <lb/>
            cause which is unfavourable to us, 66. Difficult points must be <lb/>
            variously managed, according to the nature of the case, 67—74. <lb/>
            In a conjectural cause we must make a statement, but with art <lb/>
            and care, 75—81. We must sometimes divide our statement, and <lb/>
            invert the order of occurrences, 82—87. Of fictitious statements, <lb/>
            88—93. Complexion of a statement, 94—100. How we must <lb/>

          <p>You have prevailed on me, by your daily importunity to pro­ <lb/>
            ceed at once to publish the books on the Education of an Orator, <lb/>
            which I had addressed to my friend Marcellus; for, for my <lb/>
            own part, I thought that they were not yet sufficiently advanced <lb/>
            towards perfection.‡ On the composition of them, as you <lb/>
            know, I spent little more than two years, while distracted by <lb/>
            so many other occupations; § and this time was devoted, not <lb/>
            so much to the labour of writing, as to that of research for the <lb/>
            almost boundless work which I had undertaken, and to the <lb/>
            perusal of authors, who are innumerable. Following, besides, the <lb/>
            advice of Horace, who, in his Art of Poetry, recommends that <lb/>
            publication should not be hurried, and that a work should be <lb/>
            retained till the ninth year, I allowed time for re-considering <lb/>
            them, in order that, when the ardour of invention had cooled, <lb/>
            I might judge of them, on a more careful re-perusal, as a <lb/>
            mere reader. Yet if they are so much demanded, as you <lb/>
            say, let us give our sails to the winds, and pray for success <note type="footnote"> * An eminent bookseller at Rome, mentioned by Martial, iv. 72; <lb/>

          <p>WHEN certain persons, after I had secured rest from my <lb/>
            labours, which for twenty years I had devoted to the instruction <lb/>
            of youth, requested of me, in a friendly manner, to write some­ <lb/>
            thing on the art of speaking, I certainly resisted their solicita­ <lb/>
            tions for a long time ; because I was not ignorant that authors <lb/>
            of the greatest celebrity in both languages t had bequeathed to <lb/>
            posterity many treatises having reference to this subject, <lb/>
            written with the greatest care. 2. But by the very plea on <lb/>
            which I thought that excuse for my refusal would be more <lb/>
            readily admitted, my friends were rendered still more urgent; <lb/>
            “ since, ” they said, “amidst the various opinions of former <lb/>
            writers, some of them contradicting each other, choice was <lb/>
            difficult;" so that they appeared, not unjustifiably, to press <lb/>
            upon me the task, if not of inventing new precepts, at least <lb/>
            of pronouncing judgment concerning the old. 3. Although <lb/>
            however it was not so much the confidence of accomplishing <lb/>
            what was required of me, as the shame of refusing, that <lb/>
            prevailed with me, yet, as the subject opened itself more <lb/>
            widely, I voluntarily undertook a heavier duty than was laid <note type="footnote"> * Oram solventibus.] That the word ora means funis nauticus in <lb/>

            the same sense in iv. 2, 41. It is aptly observed by Gesner, in his <lb/>

            upon me, not only that I might oblige my best friends by <lb/>
            fuller compliance, but also that, while pursuing a common road, <lb/>
            1 might not tread merely. in other men's footsteps.</p>
          <p>4. Other authors, who have committed to writing the art of <lb/>
            oratory, have in general commenced in such a manner, as <lb/>
            if they were to put the last hand of eloquence t to those who <lb/>
            were accomplished in every other kind of learning; whether <lb/>
            from despising the branches of knowledge which we previously <lb/>
            learn, as insignificant, or from supposing that they did not fall <lb/>
            under their province, the duties of the professions being <lb/>
            distinct; or, what is more probable, from expecting no credit <lb/>
            to their ability in treating of subjects, which, however <lb/>
            necessary, are yet far removed from display; as the pinnacles <lb/>
            of buildings are seen, while the foundations are hid. 5. For <lb/>
            myself, as I consider that nothing is unnecessary to the art of <lb/>
            oratory, without which it must be confessed that an orator <lb/>
            cannot be formed, and that there is no possibility of arriving <lb/>
            at the summit of any thing without previous initiatory efforts ; <lb/>
            I shall not shrink from stooping to those lesser matters, the <lb/>
            neglect of which leaves no place for greater;‡ and shall <lb/>
            proceed to regulate the studies of the orator from his infancy, <lb/>
            just as if he were entrusted to me to be brought up.</p>
          <p>6. This work, Marcellus Victorius, I dedicate to you, whom, <lb/>
            as being most friendly to me, and animated with an extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary love of letters, I deemed most worthy of such a <lb/>
            pledge of our mutual affection; and not indeed on these <lb/>
            considerations alone, though these are of great weight, but <lb/>
            because my treatise § seemed likely to be of use for the <lb/>
            instruction of your son, whose early age shows his way clear to <lb/>
            the full splendour of genius; ∥ a treatise which I have resolved <note type="footnote"> * Demum.] Evidently put for tantum, the notion of time being set <lb/>
            aside or forgotten. The word is often thus used in Quintilian and <lb/>
            other writers of the same age. So Paulus Diaconus says, from Festus, <lb/>

            to conduct, from the very cradle as it were of oratory, through <lb/>
            all the studies which can at all assist the future speaker, to the <lb/>
            summit of that art. 7. This I the rather designed, because <lb/>
            two books on the Art of Rhetoric were already in circulation <lb/>
            under my name, though neither published by me nor composed <lb/>
            for that object; for, after holding two days' discourse with me, <lb/>
            some youths, to whom that time was devoted, had caught up <lb/>
            the first by heart; the other, which was learned indeed in a <lb/>
            greater number of days (as far as they could learn by taking <lb/>
            notes), some of my young pupils, of excellent disposition, but <lb/>
            of too great fondness for me, had made known through the in­ <lb/>
            discreet honour of publication. 8. In these books, accordingly, <lb/>
            there will be some things the same, many altered, very many <lb/>
            added, but all better arranged,- and rendered, as far as I shall <lb/>
            be able, complete.</p>
          <p>9. We are to form, then, the perfect orator, who cannot <lb/>
            exist unless as a good man; t and we require in him, there­ <lb/>
            fore, not only consummate ability in speaking, but every <lb/>
            excellence of mind. 10. For I cannot admit that the prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of moral and honourable conduct are, as some have <lb/>
            thought, to be left to the philosophers; since the man who can <lb/>
            duly sustain his character as a citizen, who is qualified for the <lb/>
            management of public and private affairs, and who can govern <lb/>
            communities by his counsels, settle them by means of laws, <lb/>
            and improve them by judicial enactments, can certainly be <lb/>
            nothing else but an orator. 11. Although I acknowledge, <lb/>
            therefore, that I shall adopt some precepts which are contained <lb/>
            in the writings of the philosophers, yet I shall maintain, with <lb/>
            justice and truth, that they belong to my subject, and have <lb/>
            a peculiar relation to the art of oratory. 12. If we have <lb/>
            constantly occasion to discourse of justice, fortitude, temper­ <lb/>
            ance, and other similar topics, so that a cause can scarce be <lb/>

            lect and copiousness of language are required, the art of the <lb/>
            orator is to be there pre-eminently exerted ? 13. These two <lb/>
            accomplishments, as Cicero very plainly proves,! were, as <lb/>
            they are joined by nature, so also united in practice, so that <lb/>
            the same persons were thought at once wise and eloquent. <lb/>
            Subsequently, the study divided itself,‡ and, through want of <lb/>
            art,§ it came to pass that the arts were considered to be <lb/>
            diverse; for, as soon as the tongue became an instrument of <lb/>
            gain, and it was made a practice to abuse the gifts of elo­ <lb/>
            quence, those who were esteemed as eloquent abandoned the <lb/>
            care of morals, which, when thus neglected, became as it were <lb/>
            the prize of the less robust intellects.∥ 14. Some, dis­ <lb/>
            liking the toil of cultivating eloquence, afterwards returned to <lb/>
            the discipline of the mind and the establishment of rules <lb/>
            of life, retaining to themselves the better part, if it could <lb/>
            be divided into two; but assuming, at the same time, the <lb/>
            most presumptuous of titles,¶ so as to be called the only <lb/>
            cultivators of wisdom; a distinction which neither the most <lb/>
            eminent commanders, nor men who were engaged with the <lb/>
            utmost distinction in the direction of the greatest affairs, and <lb/>
            in the management of whole commonwealths, ever ventured <lb/>
            to claim for themselves; for they preferred rather to practise <lb/>
            excellence of conduct than to profess it. 15. That many of <lb/>
            the ancient professors of wisdom, indeed, both delivered <lb/>

            live, I will read ily admit; but, in our own times,* the greatest <lb/>
            vices have been hid under this name in many of the professors; <lb/>
            for thev did not strive, by virtue and study, to be esteemed <lb/>
            philosophers; but adopted a peculiarity of look, austerity of <lb/>
            demeanour, and a dress different from that of other men, as <lb/>
            cloaks for the vilest immoralities.</p>
          <p>16. But those topics, which are claimed as peculiar to <lb/>
            philosophy, we all everywhere discuss; for what person (if he <lb/>
            be not an utterly corrupt charactert) does not sometimes speak <lb/>
            of justice, equity, and goodness? who, even among rustics, <lb/>
            does not make some inquiries about the causes of the operations <lb/>
            of nature ? As to the proper use and distinction of words,‡ it <lb/>
            ought to be common to all, who make their language at all <lb/>
            an object of care. 17. But it will be the orator that will under­ <lb/>
            stand and express those matters best, and if he should ever <lb/>
            arrive at perfection, the precepts of virtue would not have to <lb/>
            be sought from the schools of the philosophers. At present it <lb/>
            is necessary to have recourse, at times, to those authors who <lb/>
            have, as I said, adopted the deserted, but pre-eminently better, <lb/>
            part of philosophy, and to reclaim as it were what is our own; <lb/>
            not that we may appropriate their discoveries, but that we may <lb/>
            show them that they have usurped what belonged to others.</p>
          <p>IS. Let the orator, therefore, be such a man as may be <lb/>
            called truly wise, Dot blameless in morals § only (for that, in <note type="footnote"> * Quintilian seems to have written these observations after the <lb/>

            praise philosophy or philosophers at all after such an edict; but <lb/>
            Domitian, as Spalding observes, wished to be regarded as having pro­ <lb/>
            scribed the pretended philosophers of his time on account of the <lb/>
            badness of their characters, not as having conceived a dislike to <lb/>

            tion for speaking; a character such as, perhaps, no man <lb/>
            ever was. 19. But we are not the less, for that reason, to aim <lb/>
            at perfection, for which most of the ancients strove; who, <lb/>
            though they thought that no wise man had yet been found, <lb/>
            nevertheless laid down directions for gaining wisdom. 20. <lb/>
            For the perfection of eloquence is assuredly something,* nor <lb/>
            does the nature of the human mind forbid us to reach it; but <lb/>
            if to reach it be not granted us, yet those who shall strive to <lb/>
            gain the summit will make higher advances than those who, <lb/>
            prematurely conceiving a despair of attaining the point at <lb/>
            which they aim, shall at once sink down at the foot of the <lb/>
            ascent.</p>
          <p>21. Indulgence will so much the more then be granted me, <lb/>
            if I shall not even pass over those lesser matters, which yet <lb/>
            are necessary to the work which I have undertaken. The first <lb/>
            book will, therefore, contain those particular which are ante­ <lb/>
            cedent to the duties of the teacher of rhetoric. In the second <lb/>
            we shallconsiderthe first elements of instruction under the <lb/>
            hands of the professor of rhetoric, and the questions which are <lb/>
            asked concerning the subject of rhetoric itself. 22. The five <lb/>
            next will be devoted to invention (for under this head will also <lb/>
            be included arrangement), and the four following to elocution, <lb/>
            within the scope of which fall memory and'pronunciation. <lb/>
            One will be added, inwhich the orator himself will be com­ <lb/>
            pletely formed by us, since we shall consider, as far as our <lb/>
            weakness shall be able, what his morals ought to be, what <lb/>
            should be his practice in undertaking, studying, and pleading <lb/>
            causes; what should be his style of eloquence, what termina­ <lb/>
            tion† there should be to his pleading, and what may be his <lb/>
            employments after its termination.</p>
          <p>23. Among all these discussions shall be introduced, as <lb/>

            which alone some have given the name of art, and interpret <lb/>
            (so to express myself) the law of rhetoric, but may serve to <lb/>
            nourish the faculty of speech, and strengthen the power of <lb/>
            eloquence; 24. for, in general, those bare treatises on art,­ <lb/>
            through too much affectation of subtilty, break and cut down <lb/>
            whatever is noble in eloquence, drink up as it were all the blood <lb/>
            of thought, and lay bare the bones, which, while they ought to <lb/>
            exist, and to be united by their ligaments, ought still to be <lb/>
            covered with flesh. 25. We therefore have not, like most <lb/>
            authors, included in our books that small partt merely, but <lb/>
            whatever we thought useful for the education of the orator, <lb/>
            explaining every point with brevity; for if we should say, on <lb/>
            every particular, as much as might be said, no end would be <lb/>
            found to our work.</p>
          <p>26. It is to be stated, however, in the first place, that precepts <lb/>
            and treatises on art are of no avail without the assistance of <lb/>
            nature; and these instructions, therefore, are not written for <lb/>
            him to whom talent is wanting, any more than treatises on <lb/>
            agriculture for barren ground.</p>
          <p>27. There are also certain other natural aids, us power <lb/>
            of voice, a constitution capable of labour, health, courage, <lb/>
            gracefulness; qualities which, if they fall to our lot in a <lb/>
            moderate degree, may be improved by practice, but which are <lb/>
            often so far wanting that their deficiency renders abortive the <lb/>
            benefits of understanding and study ; and these very qualities, <lb/>
            likewise, are of no profit in themselves without a skilful <lb/>
            teacher, persevering study, and great and continued exercise <lb/>
            in writing, reading, and speaking. <note type="footnote"> * Nudce illæ artes.] Artes was a name for books containing rules of <lb/>

          <p>Remarks on the capacities of boys in general, § 1—3. Of nurses, <lb/>

          <p>1.LET a father, then, as soon as his son is born, conceive, <lb/>
            first of all, the best possible hopes of him; for he will thus <lb/>
            grow the more solicitous about his improvement from the very <lb/>
            beginning; since it is a complaint without foundation that <lb/>
            11 to very iew people is granted the faculty of comprehending <lb/>
            what is imparted to them, and that most, through dulness of <lb/>
            understanding, lose their labour and their time." For, on the <lb/>
            contrary, you will find the greater number of men both ready <lb/>
            in conceiving and quick in learning; since such quickness is <lb/>
            natural to man; and as birds are born to fly, horses to run, <lb/>
            and wild beasts to show fierceness, so to us peculiarly belong <lb/>
            activity and sagacity of understanding; whence the origin of <lb/>
            the mind is thought to be from heaven. 2. But dull and <lb/>
            unteachable persons are no more produced in the course of <lb/>
            nature than are persons marked by monstrosity and deformi­ <lb/>
            ties ; such are certainly but few. It will be a proof of this <lb/>
            assertion, that, among boys, good promise is shown in the far <lb/>
            greater number; and, if it passes off in the progress of time, <lb/>
            it is manifest that it was not natural ability, but care, that was <lb/>
            wanting. 3. But one surpasses another, you will say, in <lb/>
            ability. I grant that this is true; but only so far as to <lb/>
            accomplish more or less; whereas there is no one who has not <lb/>
            gained something by study. Let him who is convinced of this <lb/>
            truth, bestow, as soon as he becomes a parent, the most vigi­ <lb/>
            lant possible care on cherishing the hopes of a future orator.</p>
          <p>4. Before all things, let the talk of the child's nurses not be <lb/>
            ungrammatical. Chrysippus wished them, if possible, to be <lb/>
            women of some knowledge; at any rate he would have the <lb/>
            best, as far as circumstances would allow, chosen. To their <lb/>
            morals, doubtless, attention is first to be paid; but let them <lb/>
            also speak with propriety. 5. It is they that the child will bear <pb n="10"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            first; it is their words that he will try to form by imitation. <lb/>
            We are by nature most tenacious of what we have imbibed in <lb/>
            our infant years ; as the flavour, with which you scent vessels <lb/>
            when new, remains in them ; nor can the colours of wool, for <lb/>
            which its plain whiteness has been exchanged, be effaced; <lb/>
            and those very habits, which are of a more objectionable <lb/>
            nature, adhere with the greater tenacity; for good ones are <lb/>
            easily changed for the worse, but when will you change bad <lb/>
            ones into good ? [Let the child not be accustomed, therefore, <lb/>
            even while he is yet an infant, to phraseology which must b3 <lb/>
            unlearned.</p>
          <p>6. In parents I should wish that there should be as much <lb/>
            learning as possible. Nor do I speak, indeed, merely of <lb/>
            fathers; for we have heard that Cornelia, the mother of the <lb/>
            Gracchi (whose very learned writing in her letters has come <lb/>
            down to posterity), contributed greatly to their eloquence; <lb/>
            the daughter of Lælius * is said to have exhibited her <lb/>
            father's elegance in her conversation; and the oration of <lb/>
            the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, delivered before the <lb/>
            Triumviri,t is read not merely as an honour to her sex. 7. <lb/>
            Nor let those parents, who have not had the fortune to get <lb/>
            learning themselves, bestow the less care on the instruction of <lb/>
            their children, but let them, on this very account, be more <lb/>
            solicitous as to other ‡particulars.</p>
          <p>Of the boys,§ among whom he who is destined to this <lb/>
            prospect is to be educated, the same may be said as concerning <lb/>
            nurses.</p>
          <p>8. Of pædagogi∥this further may be said, that they should <note type="footnote"> * Caius Lælius, surnamed the Wise, hadtwo daughters, one of <lb/>

            want of learning; for none are more pernicious than those <lb/>
            who, having gone some little beyond the first elements, clothe <lb/>
            themselves in a mistaken persuasion of their own knowledge; <lb/>
            since they disdain to yield to those who are skilled in teaching, <lb/>
            and, growing imperious, and sometimes fierce, in a certain <lb/>
            right, as it were, of exercising their authority (with which that <lb/>
            sort of men are generally puffed up), they teach only their <lb/>

            manners of their pupils; for Leonides, the tutor of Alexander, <lb/>
            as is related by Diogenes of Babylon,* tinctured him with <lb/>
            certain bad habits, which adhered to him, from his childish <lb/>

            attentive pædagogus, not unskilled in language, who, if anything <lb/>
            Is spoken incorrectly by the nurse in the presence of his pupil, <lb/>
            may at once correct it, and not let it settle in his mind. But <lb/>
            let it be understood that what I prescribed at first is the right <lb/>
            course and this only a remedy.</p>
          <p>12.[I prefer that a boy should begin with the Greek <lb/>
            language, because he will acquire Latin, which is in general use, <lb/>
            even though we tried to prevent him, and because, at the same <lb/>
            time, he ought first to be instructed in Greek learning, from <lb/>
            which ours is derived.] 13. Yet I should not wish this rule to be <lb/>
            so superstitiously observed that he should for a long time speak <lb/>
            or learn only Greek, as is the custom with most people ; for <lb/>
            hence arise many faults of pronunciation, which is viciously <lb/>
            adapted to foreign sounds, and also of language, in which <lb/>
            when Greek idioms have become inherent by constant usage, <lb/>
            they keep their place most pertinaciously even when we speak <lb/>
            a different tongue. 14. The study of Latin ought therefore <lb/>
            to follow at no long interval, and soon after to keep pace with the <lb/>
            Greek ; and thus it will happen, that, when we have begun to <lb/>
            attend to both tongues with equal care, neither will impede <lb/>
            the other.</p>
          <p>15. Some have thought that boys, as long as they are under <lb/>
            seven years of age, should not be set to learn, because that is <lb/>
            the earliest age that can understand what is taught, and <lb/>
            endure the labour of learning. Of which opinion a great many <lb/>
            writers say that Hesiod was, at least such writers as lived <lb/>
            before Aristophanes the grammarian,* for he was the first to <lb/>
            deny that the '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υποθη̃ϰαι</foreign>,† in which this opinion is found, was <lb/>
            the work of that poet. 16. But other writers likewise, amone <note type="footnote"> * Concerning this grammarian, consult especially F. A. Wolfs <lb/>

            seems very nearly to agree with Hesiod in opinion, though he does not <lb/>
            (as Regius states, and after him Harles ad Fabric. Biblioth. Or. v. 1, p. <lb/>
            15) make any allusion to this precept of Hesiod. Spalding, </note> <pb n="13"/>

            however, advise better, who, like Chrysippus, think that no part <lb/>
            of a child's life should be exempt from tuition ; for Chrysippus, <lb/>
            though he has allowed three years to the nurses, yet is of opi­ <lb/>
            nion that the minds of children may be imbued with excellent <lb/>
            instruction even by them. 17. And why should not that age <lb/>
            be under the influence of learning, which is now confessedly <lb/>
            subject to moral influence ?† I am not indeed ignorant <lb/>
            that, during the whole time of which I am speaking, scarcely <lb/>
            as much can be done as one year may afterwards accomplish, <lb/>
            yet those who are of the opinion which I have mentioned, ap­ <lb/>
            pear with regard to this part of life to have spared not so much <lb/>
            the learners as the teachers. 18. What else, after they are <lb/>
            able to speak, will children do better,‡ for they must do some­ <lb/>
            thing ? Or why should we despise the gain, how little soever <lb/>
            it be, previous to the age of seven years ? For certainly, small <lb/>
            as may be the proficiency which an earlier age exhibits, the <lb/>
            child will yet learn something greater during the very year in <lb/>
            which he would have been learning something less. 19. This <lb/>
            advancement extended through each year, is a profit on the <lb/>
            whole; and whatever is gained in infancy is an acquisition to <lb/>
            youth. The same rule should be prescribed as to the following <lb/>
            years, so that what every boy has to learn, he may not be too <lb/>
            late in beginning to learn. [Let us not then lose even the <lb/>
            earliest period of life, and so much the less, as the elements of <lb/>
            learning depend on the memory alone, which not only exists <lb/>
            in children, but is at that time of life even most tenacious.]</p>

            25. This method hinders their recognition of them, as, while <lb/>

            again the contrary way, and confuse them by variously changing <lb/>
            the arrangement, until their pupils know them by their <lb/>
            shape, not by their place. It will be best for children, <lb/>
            therefore, to be taught the appearances and names of the <lb/>
            letters at once, as they are taught those of men. 26. But that <lb/>

            quality, is by no means an indifferent matter; for as writing <lb/>

            reading off what is to be copied from the writing.‡ 29. At all <lb/>
            times, therefore, and in all places, and especially in writing <lb/>
            private and familiar letters, it will be a source of pleasure to <lb/>
            us, not to have neglected even this acquirement.</p>
          <p>— 30. For learning syllables there is no short way; they must <lb/>
            all be learned throughout; nor are the most difficult of them, <lb/>
            as is the general practice, to be postponed, that children may be <lb/>
            at a loss, forsooth, in writing words.§ 31. Moreover, we must <lb/>
            not even trust to the first learning by heart; it will be better to <lb/>
            have syllables repeated, and to impress them long upon the <lb/>
            memory; and in reading too, not to hurry on, in order to <lb/>
            make it continuous or quick, until the clear and certain con­ <lb/>

            forward, depends not merely on rule, but on habit,. since, <lb/>
            while the child is looking to what follows, he has to pronounce <lb/>
            what goes before, and, what is very difficult, the direction of <lb/>
            his thoughts must be divided, so that one duty may be dis­ <lb/>

          <p>When the child shall have begun, as is the practice, to write <lb/>
            words, it will cause no regret if we take care that he may not <lb/>
            waste his efforts on common words, and such as perpetually <lb/>
            occur. 35. For he may readily learn the explanations of <lb/>
            obscure terms, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλώσσαι</foreign>, while some other <lb/>
            occupation is before him, and acquire, amidst his first rudi­ <lb/>
            ments, a knowledge of that which would afterwards demand a <lb/>
            special time for it. Since, too, we are still attending to small <lb/>
            matters, I would express a wish that even the lines, which are <lb/>

            sentences, but such as convey some moral instruction. 36. The <lb/>

            since memory (as I shall show in its proper place) is most neces­ <lb/>

            almost the only faculty that can be improved by the aid of <lb/>

          <p>Considerations on public and private education; public education to be <lb/>
            preferred; alleged corruption of morals in public schools; equal <lb/>
            corrupt, on at home, § 1—8. Reply to the objection that a <lb/>
            pupil receives less attention from a master in a school than from <lb/>
            a domestic tutor, 9—16. Emulation, friendship, incitements <lb/>
            to masters and pupils, and other advantages of public education, <lb/>
            17—31.</p>
          <p>1. BUT let us suppose that the child now gradually increases <lb/>
            in size, leaves the lap, and applies himself to learning in <lb/>
            earnest. In this place, accordingly, must be considered the <lb/>
            question, whether it be more advantageous to confine the <lb/>
            learner at home, and within the walls of a private house, or to <lb/>
            commit him to the large numbers of a school, and, as it were, <lb/>
            to public teachers. 2. The latter mode, I observe, has had <lb/>
            the sanction of those by whom the polity of the most eminent <lb/>
            states was settled, as well as that of the most illustrious <lb/>
            authors.</p>
          <p>Yet it is not to be concealed, that tnere are some who, from <note type="footnote"> * Velut publicis præceptoribus. ] Respecting the meaning of the word <lb/>
            velut I cannot satisfy myself, and am surprised that no commentator <lb/>
            has made any remark upon it. I suspect, however, that Quintilian <lb/>
            thought it necessary to qualify the word publicis by velut because these <lb/>
            teachers could not properly be called public, as they did not receive <lb/>
            salaries from the public treasury. Quintilian himself is mentioned by <lb/>
            St. Jerome, in Eusebius's Chronicon, as the first master of a public <lb/>
            school that received a stipend from the emperor ; and perhaps, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the mode of speaking in those times, he could not properly be <lb/>
            called a public teacher, for the very reason that he received his pay, <lb/>
            not from the public treasury, but from the emperor'a privy purse. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. II] </note> <lb/>
            certain notions of their own, disapprove of this almost* public <lb/>
            mode of instruction. These persons appear to be swayed <lb/>
            chiefly by two reasons: one, that they take better precautions <lb/>
            for the morals of the young, by avoiding a concourse of human <lb/>
            beings of that age which is most prone to vice ; (from which <lb/>
            cause I wish it were falsely asserted that provocations to <lb/>
            immoral conduct arise;) the other, that whoever may be <lb/>
            the teacher, he is likely to bestow his time more liberally <lb/>
            on one pupil, than if he has to divide it among several. <lb/>
            3. The first reason indeed deserves great consideration; for if <lb/>
            it were certain that schools, though advantageous to studies, <lb/>
            are pernicious to morals, a virtuous course of life would <lb/>
            seem to me preferable to one even of the most distinguished <lb/>
            eloquence. But in my opinion, the two are combined and <lb/>
            inseparable; for I am convinced that no one can be an orator <lb/>
            who is not a good man; and, even if any one could, I should <lb/>
            be unwilling that he should be. On this point, therefore, I <lb/>
            shall speak first.</p>
          <p>4. People think that morals are corrupted in schools; for in­ <lb/>
            deed they are at times corrupted; but such may be the case even <lb/>
            at home. Many proofs of this fact may be adduced; proofs of <lb/>
            character† having been vitiated, as well as preserved with the <lb/>
            utmost purity, under both modes of education. It is the dis­ <lb/>
            position of the individual pupil, and the care taken of him, that <lb/>
            make the whole difference.‡ Suppose that his mind be prone <lb/>
            to vice, suppose that there be neglect in forming and guarding <lb/>
            his morals in early youth, seclusion would afford no less <lb/>
            opportunity for immorality than publicity; for the private <lb/>
            tutor may be himself of bad character; nor is intercourse with <lb/>
            vicious slaves at all safer than that with immodest free-born <lb/>
            youths. 5. § But if his disposition he good, and if there be <lb/>
            not a blind and indolent negligence on the part of his parents, <note type="footnote"> * Prope publico more.] For this adverb prope it seems still more <lb/>
            difficult to say anything satisfactory than for the preceding velut. <lb/>
            Perhaps Quintilian used it because the children are not altogether taken <lb/>
            from under the control of their parents, as was the case, for instance, <lb/>
            at Sparta. </note><note type="footnote"> t Opinionis. That is, existimationis, famæ. Spalding. So Regius. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Natura cujusque totum curaque distat.] “Natura cujusque pueri et <lb/>

            it will be possible for them to select a tutor of irreproach <lb/>
            able character, (a matter to which the utmost attention is paid <lb/>
            by sensible parents,) and to fix on a course of instruction of <lb/>
            the very strictest kind; while they may at the same time place <lb/>
            at the elbow of their son some influential friend or faithful <lb/>
            freedman, whose constant attendance may improve even those <lb/>
            of whom apprehensions may be entertained.</p>
          <p>6. The remedy for this object of fear is easy. Would that <lb/>
            we ourselves did not corrupt the morals of our children! We <lb/>
            enervate their very infancy with luxuries. That delicacy of <lb/>
            education, which we call fondness, weakens all the powers, <lb/>
            both of body and mind. What luxury will he not covet in his <lb/>
            manhood, who crawls about on purple ! He cannot yet articu­ <lb/>
            late his first words, when he already distinguishes scarlet, and <lb/>
            wants his purple.. 7. We form the palate of children before <lb/>
            we form their pronunciation. They grow up in sedan chairs; <lb/>
            if they touch the ground, they hang by the hands of attendants <lb/>
            supporting them on each side. We are delighted if they utter <lb/>
            any thing immodest. Expressions which would not be tole­ <lb/>
            rated even from the effeminate youths of Alexandria,! we hear <lb/>
            from them with a smile and a kiss. Nor is this wonderful; we <lb/>
            have taught them; they have heard such language from our­ <lb/>
            selves. 8. They see our mistresses, our male objects of <lb/>
            affection; every dining-room rings with impure songs; things <lb/>
            shameful to be told are objects of sight. From such practices <lb/>
            springs habit, and afterwards nature. The unfortunate <lb/>
            children learn these vices before they know that they are <note type="footnote"> * Jam coccum intelligit, jam conchylium poscit.] Spalding, with Passe­ <lb/>
            ratius, would read coquum, " he knows the cook," and take conchylium in <lb/>
            the sense of “shell-fish,” as in Hor. Epod. ii. 49; Sat ii. 4, 30 ; 8, 27, <lb/>
            in order that there may be no recurrence to purple, after in purpuris <lb/>
            repit, but that this sentence may refer wholly to eating, and be aptly <lb/>
            followed by ante palatum eorum, quàm os, instituimus. All the other <lb/>
            commentators are satisfied with coccum, “ scarlet," and understand <lb/>
            conchylium as meaning “ purple;" but certainly this appears to <lb/>
            be needless repetition. Pliny indeed distinguishes conchylium from <lb/>
            purpura, but we are obliged to translate them both by the same word. </note><note type="footnote"> t A lexandrinis—deliciis.] All the co mmentators before Burmann <lb/>
            referred these words to the general luxury of the Egyptians, or to the <lb/>
            rites of Serapis ; " but Quintilian," says that critic, " does not allude so <lb/>
            much to the luxury of the Egyptians, as to that of the Romans, circa <lb/>
            pueros Alexandrinos ; see the commentators on Petronius, c. xxxi." <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH.II ]</note> <lb/>
            vices; and hence, rendered effeminate and luxurious, they dc <lb/>
            not imbibe immorality from schools, but carry it themselves <lb/>
            into schools.</p>
          <p>9. But, it is said, one tutor will have more time for one <lb/>
            pupil. First of all, however, nothing prevents that one pupil, <lb/>
            whoever he may be,. from being the same with him who is <lb/>
            taught in the school. But if the two objects cannot be united, <lb/>
            I should still prefer the day-light of an honourable seminary to <lb/>
            darkness and solitude; for every eminent teacher delights in a <lb/>
            large concourse of pupils, and thinks himself worthy of a still <lb/>
            more numerous auditory. 10. But inferior teachers, from a con­ <lb/>
            sciousness of their inability, do not disdain to fasten on single <lb/>
            pupils, and to discharge the duty as it were of pædagogi. <lb/>
            11. But supposing that either interest, or friendship, or <lb/>
            money, should secure to any parent a domestic tutor of the <lb/>
            highest learning, and in every respect unrivalled, will he how­ <lb/>
            ever spend the whole day on one pupil ? Or can the applica­ <lb/>
            tion of any pupil be so constant as not to be sometimes <lb/>
            wearied, like the sight of the eyes, by continued direction to <lb/>
            one object, especially as study requires the far greater portion <lb/>
            of time to be solitary.† 12. For the tutor does not stand by <lb/>
            the pupil while he is writing, or learning by heart, or thinking; <lb/>
            and when he is engaged in any of those exercises, the company <lb/>
            of any person whatsoever is a hindrance to him. Nor does <lb/>
            every kind of reading require at all times a prælector or <lb/>
            interpreter; for when, if such were the case, would the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of so many authors be gained? The time, therefore, <lb/>
            during which the work as it were for the whole day may be <lb/>
            laid out, is but short. 13. Thus the instructions which are to <lb/>
            be given to each, may reach to many. Most of them, indeed, <lb/>
            are of such a nature that they may be communicated to all at <lb/>
            once with the same exertion of the voice. I say nothing of the <lb/>
            topics ‡ and declamations of the rhetoricians, at which, cer­ <note type="footnote"> * Nescio quem.] This expression is used with a certain irony, as if <lb/>
            Quintilian would say, " That wonderful pupil of whom you talk so <lb/>

            instruction. Gesner. </note><note type="footnote"> † Plus secreti.] That is, "plus secreti quàm conjuncti cum docente, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.L </note> <lb/>
            tainly, whatever be the number of the audience, each will still <lb/>
            carry off the whole. 14. For the voice of the teacher is not <lb/>
            like a meal, which will not suffice for more than a certain <lb/>
            number, but like the sun, which diffuses the same portion of <lb/>
            light and heat to all. If a grammarian, too, discourses on the <lb/>
            art of speaking, solves questions, explains matters of history, or <lb/>
            illustrates poems, as many as shall hear him will profit by his <lb/>
            instructions. 15. But, it may be said, number is an obstacle <lb/>
            to correction and explanation.* Suppose that this be a dis­ <lb/>
            advantage in a number, (for what in general t satisfies us in <lb/>
            every respect?) we will soon compare that disadvantage with <lb/>
            other advantages.</p>
          <p>Yet I would not wish a boy to be sent to a place where he <lb/>
            will be neglected. Nor should a good master encumber him­ <lb/>
            self with a greater number of scholars than he can manage; <lb/>
            and it is to be a chief object with us, also, that the master may <lb/>
            be in every way our kind friend, and may have regard in his <lb/>
            teaching, not so much to duty, as to affection. Thus we shall <lb/>
            never be confounded with the multitude. 16. Nor will any <lb/>
            master, who is in the slightest degree tinctured with literature, <lb/>
            fail particularly to cherish that pupil in whom he shall observe <lb/>
            application and genius, even for his own honour. But even if <lb/>
            great schools ought to be avoided (a position to which I cannot <lb/>
            assent, if numbers flock to a master on account of his merit), <lb/>
            the rule is not to be carried so far that schools should be <lb/>
            avoided altogether. It is one thing to shun schools, another to <lb/>
            choose from them.</p>
          <p>17. If I have now refuted the objections which are made <lb/>
            to schools, let me next state what opinions I myself en. <lb/>
            tertain. 18. First of all, let him who is to be an orator, and <lb/>
            who must live amidst the greatest publicity, and in the full day­ <lb/>
            light of public affairs, accustom himself, from his boyhood, not <lb/>
            to be abashed at the sight of men, nor pine in a solitary and <lb/>
            as it were recluse way of life. The mind requires to be con­ <lb/>
            stantly excited and roused, while in such retirement it either <lb/>
            languishes, and contracts rust, as it were, in the shade, or, on <lb/>
            the other hand, becomes swollen with empty conceit, since he <note type="footnote"> * Prœlectioni.] By prælectio is to be understood that instruction <lb/>
            which a master gives to boys in lessons which they have to prepare; <lb/>
            and which can scarcely be given to two at once. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> f Quid fere.] " What, almost, satisfies us." The meaning is, that <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. II.} </note> <lb/>
            who compares himself to no one else, will necessarily attribute <lb/>
            too much to his own powers. 19. Besides, when his acquire­ <lb/>
            ments are to be displayed in public, he is blinded at the light <lb/>
            of the sun, and stumbles at every new object, as having learned <lb/>
            in solitude that which is to be done in public. 20. I say <lb/>
            nothing of friendships formed at school, which remain in full <lb/>
            force even to old age, as if cemented with a certain religious <lb/>
            obligation ; for to have been initiated in the same studies is a <lb/>
            not less sacred bond than to have been initiated in the same <lb/>
            sacred rites. That sense, too, which is called common sense,. <lb/>
            where shall a young man learn when he has separated himself <lb/>
            from society, which is natural not to men only, but even to dumb <lb/>
            animals? 21. Add to this, that, at home, he can learn only <lb/>
            what is taught himself; at school, even what is taught others. <lb/>
            22. He will daily hear many things commended, many things <lb/>
            corrected; the idleness of a fellow student, when reproved, will <lb/>
            be a warning to him; the industry of any one, when com­ <lb/>
            mended, will be a stimulus; emulation will be excited by <lb/>
            praise; and he will think it a disgrace to yield to his equals in <lb/>
            age, and an honour to surpass his seniors. All these matters <lb/>
            excite the mind; and though ambition itself be a vice,! yet it <lb/>
            is often the parent of virtues.</p>
          <p>23. I remember a practice that was observed by my masters, <lb/>
            not without advantage. Having divided the boys into classes, <lb/>
            they assigned them their order in speaking in conformity to <lb/>
            the abilities of each; and thus each stood in the higher place to <lb/>
            declaim according as he appeared to excel in proficiency. <lb/>
            24. Judgments were pronounced on the performances; and <lb/>
            great was the strife among us for distinction ; but to take the <lb/>
            lead of the class was by far the greatest honour. Nor was <lb/>
            sentence given on our merits only once; the thirtieth day <lb/>
            brought the vanquished an opportunity of contending again. <note type="footnote"> * Spalding observes that the expression sensus communis, in the <lb/>
            signification of our " common sense," did not come into general use till <lb/>
            after the time of Cicero. It is found, be observes, in Horace, Sat. i. <lb/>
            3, 36, and Phædrus, L 7. Much the same may be said of ambitio, <lb/>
            which occurs a little below ; it was not generally used for “ ambition," <lb/>
            in our sense of the word, till after Cicero's day, though it was certainly <lb/>
            coming into use in that sense in his time. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ambition is not to be called a vice unless it be inordinate, or <lb/>
            shown in a bad cause. I know not why Quintilian as well as Sallust <lb/>
            (Cat. c. 13) should have so decidedly called it a vice. A virtuous man <lb/>
            may be ambitious as well as a vicious man. </note> <pb n="24"/>

            can form a judgment from what I conceive in my own mind, <lb/>
            that this method furnished stronger incitements to the study <lb/>
            of eloquence, than the exhortations of preceptors, the watch­ <lb/>
            fulness of pædagogi, or the wishes of parents.</p>
          <p>26. But as emulation is of use to those who have made some <lb/>
            advancement in learning,! so, to those who are but beginning, <lb/>
            and are still of tender age, to imitate their school-fellows is more <lb/>
            pleasant than to imitate their master, for the very reason that it <lb/>
            is more easy; for they who are learning the first rudiments ‡ <lb/>
            will scarcely dare to exalt themselves to the hope of attaining § <lb/>
            that eloquence which they regard as the highest; they will <lb/>
            rather fix on what is nearest to them, as vines attached to <lb/>
            trees gain the top by taking hold of the lower branches first. <lb/>
            27. This is an observation of such truth, that it is the care <lb/>
            even of the master himself, when he has to instruct minds <lb/>
            that are still unformed, not (if he prefer at least the useful to <lb/>
            the showy) to overburden the weakness of his scholars, but to <lb/>
            moderate his strength, and to let himself down to the capacity <lb/>
            of the learner. 28. For as narrow-necked vessels reject a <lb/>
            great quantity of the liquid that is poured upon them, but are <lb/>
            filled by that which flows or is poured into them by degrees, <lb/>
            so it is for us to ascertain how much the minds of boys can <lb/>
            receive, since what is too much for their grasp of intellect will <lb/>
            not enter their minds, as not being sufficiently expanded to <lb/>
            admit it. 29. It is of advantage therefore for a boy to have <lb/>
            school-fellows whom he may first imitate, and afterwards try to <lb/>
            surpass. Thus will he gradually conceive hope of higher ex­ <lb/>
            cellence.</p>
          <p>To these observations I shall add, that masters themselves, <lb/>
            when they have but one pupil at a time with them, cannot feel <lb/>
            the same degree of energy and spirit in addressing him, as <note type="footnote"> * Ad depellendam ignominiam.] "To throw off dishonour." </note><note type="footnote"> t Firmiores profectus.] Why this observation is made, says Spalding, <lb/>
            may not at once appear; but the sense is, that the more advanced <lb/>
            pupils strive with one another, who shall most resemble the master <lb/>
            himself, while the younger pupils rather make their older school-fellow. <lb/>

            when they are excited by a large number of hearers. 30. Elo­ <lb/>
            quence depends in a great degree on the state of the mind. <lb/>
            which must conceive images of objects, and transform itself, so <lb/>
            to speak, to the nature of the things of which we discourse. <lb/>
            Besides, the more noble and lofty a mind is, by the more <lb/>
            powerful springs, as it were, is it moved, and accordingly is <lb/>
            both strengthened by praise, and enlarged by effort, and is <lb/>
            filled with joy at achieving something great. 31. But a <lb/>
            certain secret disdain is felt at lowering the power of elo­ <lb/>
            quence, acquired by so much labour, to one auditor ; and the <lb/>
            teacher is ashamed to raise his style above the level of ordinary . <lb/>
            conversation. Let any one imagine, indeed, the air of a man <lb/>
            haranguing, or the voice of one entreating, the gesture, the <lb/>
            pronunciation, the agitation of mind and body, the exertion, <lb/>
            and, to mention nothing else, the fatigue, while he has but <lb/>
            one auditor; would not he seem to be affected with something <lb/>
            like madness ? There would be no eloquence in the world, <lb/>
            if we were to speak only with one person at a time.</p>

          <p>1 .LET him that is skilled in teaching, ascertain first of all, <lb/>
            when a boy is entrusted to him, his ability and disposition,] <lb/>
            The chief symptom of ability in children is memory, of which <lb/>
            the excellence is twofold, to receive with ease and retain with <lb/>
            fidelity. The next symptom is imitation; for that is an indi <lb/>
            cation of a teachable disposition, but with this provision, that <lb/>
            it express merely what it is taught, and not a person's manner <lb/>
            or walk, for instance, or whatever may be remarkable for de­ <lb/>
            formity. 2. The boy who shall make it his aim to raise a <lb/>
            laugh by his love of mimicry, will afford me no hope of good <lb/>
            capacity; for be who is possessed of great talent will be <lb/>
            well disposed; else I should think it not at all worse <lb/>
            to be of a dull, than of a bad, disposition; but he who is <lb/>
            honourably inclined will be very different from the stupid or <pb n="26"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.I. </note> <lb/>
            idle. 3. Such a pupil as I would have, will easily learn what <lb/>
            is taught him, and will ask questions about some things, but <lb/>
            will still rather follow than run on before. That precocious <lb/>
            sort of talent scarcely ever comes to good fruit. 4. Such are <lb/>
            those who do little things easily, and, impelled by impudence, <lb/>
            show at once all that they can accomplish in such matters.. <lb/>
            But they succeed only in what is ready to their hand; they <lb/>
            string words together, uttering them with an intrepid counte <lb/>
            Dance. not in the least discouraged by bashfulness; and do <lb/>
            little, but do it readily. 5. There is no real power behind, or <lb/>
            any that rests on deeply fixed roots; but they are like seeds <lb/>
            which have been scattered on the surface of the ground <lb/>
            and shoot up prematurely, and like grass that resembles <lb/>
            corn, and grows yellow, with empty ears, before the time of <lb/>
            harvest. Their efforts give pleasure, as compared with their <lb/>
            years; but their progress comes to a stand, and our wonder <lb/>
            diminishes.</p>
          <p>6. [When a tutor has observed these indications, let him next <lb/>
            consider how the mind of his pupil is to be managed. Some boys <lb/>
            are indolent, unless you stimulate them ; some are indignant at <lb/>
            being commanded ; fear restrains some, and unnerves others ; <lb/>
            continued labour forms some; with others, hasty efforts succeed <lb/>
            better.] 7. Let the boy be given to me, whom praise stimulates, <lb/>
            whom honour delights, who weeps when he is unsuccessful. <lb/>
            His powers must be cultivated under the influence of am­ <lb/>
            bition ; reproach will sting him to the quick; honour will <lb/>
            incite him; and in such a boy I shall never be apprehensive <lb/>
            of indifference.</p>
          <p>8. Yet some relaxation is to be allowed to all; not only <lb/>
            because there is nothing that can bear perpetual labour, (and <lb/>
            even those things that are without sense and life are unbent by <lb/>
            alternate rest, as it were, in order that they may preserve their <lb/>
            vigour,) but because application to learning depends on the <lb/>
            will, which cannot be forced. 9. Boys, accordingly, when re- <lb/>
            invigorated and refreshed, bring more sprightliness to their <lb/>
            learning, and a more, determined spirit, which for the most <lb/>
            part spurns compulsion. 10. Nor will play in boys dis­ <lb/>
            please me; it is also a sign of vivacity ; and I cannot expect <note type="footnote"> * Illic.] Gesner and Spalding, fcllowing Gebhard, would read iUico, <lb/>

            that he who is always dull and spiritless will be of an eager <lb/>
            disposition in his studies, when he is indifferent even to that <lb/>
            excitement which is natural to his age. 11: There must how­ <lb/>
            ever be bounds set to relaxation, lest the refusal of it beget an <lb/>
            aversion to study, or too much indulgence in it a habit of <lb/>
            idleness. There are some kinds of amusement, too, not <lb/>
            unserviceable for sharpening the wits of boys, as when they <lb/>
            contend with each other by proposing all sorts of questions in <lb/>
            turn. 12. In their plays, also, their moral dispositions show <lb/>
            themselves more plainly, supposing. that there is no age so <lb/>
            tender that it may not readily learn what is right and wrong; <lb/>
            and the tender age may best be formed at a time when it is igno­ <lb/>
            rant of dissimulation, and most willingly submits to instructors; <lb/>
            for you may break, sooner than mend, that which has hardened <lb/>
            into deformity. 13. A child is as early as possible, therefore, <lb/>
            to be admonished that he must do nothing too eagerly, nothing <lb/>
            dishonestly, nothing without self-control; and we must always <lb/>
            keep in mind the maxim of Virgil, Adeo in teneris consuescere <lb/>
            multum est, “of so much importance is the acquirement of habit <lb/>
            in the young."</p>
          <p>14. L But that boys should suffer corporal punishment, though <lb/>
            it be a received custom, and Chrysippus makes no objection to <lb/>
            it, I by no means approve: first, because it is a disgrace, and <lb/>
            a punishment for slaves, and in reality (as will be evident if <lb/>
            you imagine the age changed +) an affront; secondly, because, <lb/>
            if a boy's disposition be so abject as not to be amended by <lb/>
            reproof, be will be hardened, like the worst of slaves, even to <lb/>
            stripes; and lastly, because, if one who regularly exacts his <lb/>
            tasks be with him, there will not be the least need of any <lb/>
            such chastisement. 15. At present, the negligence of pœdagogi <lb/>
            seems to be made amends for in such a way that boys ‡ are not <lb/>
            obliged to do what is right, but are punished whenever they <note type="footnote"> * The character in childhood displays itself to advantage, provided <lb/>

            to whom such terror cannot be held out, and by whom more <lb/>
            difficult studies must be pursued? 16. Add to these consider­ <lb/>

            that the Greek should take the precedence. 2. Both have the <lb/>
            same method. This profession, then, distinguished as it is, <lb/>
            most compendiously, into two parts, the art of speaking cor. <lb/>
            rectly, and the illustration of the poets, carries more beneath the <lb/>
            surface than it shows on its front. 3. For not only is the art <lb/>
            of writing combined with that of speaking, but correct reading <lb/>
            also precedes illustration, and with all these is joined the exer­ <lb/>
            cise of judgment, which the old grammarians,! indeed, used <lb/>
            with such severity, that they not only allowed themselves to <lb/>

            some authors within their canon, and excluded others altogether <lb/>
            from classification.§ 4. Nor is it sufficient to have read thex <lb/>
            poets only ; every class of writers must be studied, not simply <lb/>
            for matter, but for words, which often receive their authority <lb/>
            from writers. Nor can grammar be complete without a know­ <lb/>

            will now scarcely be doubted. Regius, and others of the older critics, <lb/>
            thought that redigere in ordinem signified “ to condemn" (as cohere in <lb/>
            ordinem, "to reduce to the ranks,”in Livy and other writers, with <lb/>
            reference to a tribune or centurion), and eximere è numero, “to select <lb/>

            and Lucretius among the Latins, who have committed the pre­ <lb/>
            cepts of philosophy to verse. 5. The grammarian has also <lb/>

            then we borrow two letters- from the Greeks, but, properly, in <lb/>
            Latin: 8. as in these words, serum at uulgus, the Æolic di­ <lb/>

            not a word of four syllables, but only of three ; yet the second is not <lb/>
            lengthened, as the first i becomes in reality a consonant. Gesner. </note><note type="footnote"> § The case is different with regard to the same two consonants <lb/>

            consonant sometimes " breaks" another different from itself; thus <lb/>
            liquids “break " mutes, i.e. coalesce with them in such a manner as to <lb/>
            form one sound, and on that account do not necessarily lengthen a <lb/>
            short vowel preceding them. This passage is fully illustrated by <lb/>
            another of Quintilian, xii. 10, 29, where the letter f, in the very word <lb/>
            frango, is said to break a consonant. Gesner. In this example, how­ <lb/>
            ever, it is not the liquid that is said to " break " or weaken the mute, <lb/>

            who are to teach. The attention of the learner will then be <lb/>
            transferred to syllables, on which I shall make a few remarks <lb/>
            under the head of orthography.</p>
          <p>He, whom this matter shall concern, will then understand <lb/>
            how many parts of speech there are, and what they are; <lb/>
            though as to their number writers are by no means agreed. 18. <lb/>
            For the more ancient, among whom were Aristotle and Theo­ <lb/>
            dectes, said that there were only verbs, nouns, and convinctions, <lb/>
            because, that is to say, they judged that the force of language <lb/>
            was in verbs, and the matter of it in nouns (since the one is <lb/>
            what we speak, and the other that of which we speak), and that <lb/>
            the union of words lay in convinctions, which, I know, are by <lb/>
            most writers called conjunctions, but the other term seems to <lb/>
            be a more exact translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνδεσμός</foreign>.19. By the phi­ <lb/>
            losophers, and chiefly the Stoics, the number was gradually in­ <lb/>
            creased ; to the convinctions were first added articles, then <lb/>
            prepositions; to nouns was added the appellation, next the <lb/>
            pronoun, and afterwards the participle, partaking of the nature Or <lb/>
            the verb; to verbs themselves were joined adverbs. Our lan­ <lb/>
            guage does not require articles, and they are therefore divided <lb/>
            among other parts of speech.* To the parts of speech already <note type="footnote"> locus is shown by Festus, who also mentions stlata, a kind of boat, from <lb/>

            aid, sometimes of one part of speech, sometimes of another. But the <lb/>
            chief instrument for supplying the want of the article was the pronoun <lb/>

            however, certainly of competent judgment, have made eight <lb/>
            parts of speech, as Aristarchus, and Palæmon * in our own day, <lb/>
            who have included the vocable, or appellation, under the name <lb/>
            or noun, as if a species of it.t But those who make the noun <lb/>
            one, and the vocable another, reckon nine. But there were <lb/>
            some, nevertheless, who even distinguished the vocable from the <lb/>
            appellation, so that the vocable should signify any substance <lb/>
            manifest to the sight and touch, as a house, a bed; the ap­ <lb/>
            pellation, that to which one or both of these properties should <lb/>
            be wanting, as the wind, heaven, God, virtue. They added also <lb/>
            the asseveration, as heu, "alas!" and the attreetation, as <lb/>
            fasceatim, " in bundles;" ‡ distinctions which are not approved <lb/>
            by me. 2J. Whether <foreign xml:lang="grc">πςοϭηγοςία</foreign> should be translated by <lb/>
            vocable or appellation, and whether it should be comprehended <lb/>
            under the noun or not, are questions on which, as being of <lb/>
            little importance, I leave it free to others to form an opinion.</p>
          <p>22. Let boys in the first place learn to decline nouns and' <lb/>
            conjugate verbs; for otherwise they will never arrive at the <lb/>
            understanding of what is to follow; an admonition which it <lb/>
            would be superfluous to give, were it not that most teachers, <lb/>
            through ostentatious haste, begin where they ought to end, and, <lb/>
            while they wish to show off their pupils in matters of greater <lb/>
            display, retard their progress by attempting to shorten the <lb/>
            road. 23. But if a teacher has sufficient learning, and (what <lb/>
            is often found not less wanting) be willing to teach what he <lb/>
            has learned, he will not be content with stating that there are <lb/>

            hastd percussi, " I have struck with a spear," I do not express <lb/>
            the sense of an ablative case,‡ nor, if I say the same thing in <lb/>
            Greek, that of a dative.</p>
          <p>27. As to verbs, who is so ignorant as not to know their <lb/>
            kinds, qualities, persons, and numbers ? Those things belong <lb/>
            to the reading school, and to the lower departments of instruc­ <lb/>
            tion. But such points as are not determined by inflexion, <lb/>
            will puzzle some people; for it may be doubted, as to certain <lb/>
            words, whether they are participles, or nouns formed from the <lb/>
            verb, as lectus, sapiens. 28. Some verbs look like nouns, asfrau­ <lb/>
            dator, nutritor. Is not the verb in Itur in antiquam silvam <lb/>
            of a peculiar nature, for what beginning of it can you find?|| <lb/>
            Fletur is similar to it. We understand the passive sometimes <lb/>
            in one way, as, <lb/>
            Panditur interea domus omnipotentis Olympi; <note type="footnote"> * Scrutabitur mille prœceptor-origines nominum.] Burmann would <lb/>
            read ille præceptor, not liking the expression mille origines. The <lb/>

            have a different signification from that which their form indi­ <lb/>
            cates. I need hardly add, that many verbs do not go through <lb/>
            the whole course of conjugation. Some, too, undergo a change, <lb/>
            as fero in the preterperfect; some are expressed only in the <lb/>

            resemblance to nouns passing into adverbs; for, as we say noctu <lb/>

          <p>1. SINCE all language has three kinds of excellence, to <lb/>
            be correct, perspicuous, and elegant, (for to speak with propriety, <lb/>
            which is its highest quality, most writers include under <lb/>
            elegance.) and the same number of faults, which are the op­ <lb/>
            posites of the excellences just mentioned, let the grammarian <lb/>
            consider well the rules for correctness which constitute the first <lb/>
            part of grammar. 2. These rules are required to be observed. <lb/>
            verbis aut singulis aut pluribus, in regard to one or more words. <lb/>
            The word verbum I wish to be here understood in a general <lb/>
            sense, for it has two significations: the one, which includes all <lb/>
            words of which language is composed, as in the verse of <lb/>
            Horace, <lb/>
            Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur, <lb/>
            " And words, not unwilling, will follow provided matter;" the <note type="footnote"> * Namely, when neuters and intransitives, which properly have no <lb/>
            passive voice, assume the nature of transitives, by being joined with a <lb/>
            nominative case in the passive. Spalding. </note> <pb n="38"/>
            <note type="margin"> fB. L </note> <lb/>
            other, under which is comprehended only one part of speech, <lb/>
            as lego, scribo; to avoid which ambiguity some have preferred <lb/>
            the terms voces, dictiones, locutiones. 3. Words, considered <lb/>
            singly, are either our own, or foreign, simple or compound. <lb/>
            proper or metaphorical, in common use or newly invented.</p>
          <p>A word taken singly is oftener objectionable than fault­ <lb/>
            less ;* for however we may express anything with pro­ <lb/>
            priety, elegance, and sublimity, none of these qualities arise <lb/>
            from anything but the connection and order of the discourse; <lb/>
            since we commend single words merely as being well suited tc <lb/>
            the matter. The only good quality, which can be remarked <lb/>
            in them, is their vocalitas, so to speak, called <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐφωνία</foreign>, <lb/>
            " euphony; It which depends upon selection,! when of two words, <lb/>
            which have the same signification, and are of equal force, we <lb/>
            make choice of the one that has the better sound.</p>
          <p>5. First of all, let the offensiveness of barbarisms and <lb/>
            solecisms be put away. But as these faults are sometimes <lb/>
            excused, either from custom, or authority, or, perhaps, from <lb/>
            their nearness to beauties, (for it is often difficult to distinguish <lb/>
            faults from figures of speech,) let the grammarian, that so <lb/>
            uncertain a subject of observation may deceive no one, give his <lb/>
            earnest attention to that nice discrimination, of which we shall <lb/>
            speak more fully in the part where we shall have to treat of <lb/>
            figures of speech.‡ 6. Meanwhile, let an offence committed <lb/>
            in regard to a single word, be called a barbarism.</p>
          <p>But some one may stop me with the remark, what is there <lb/>
            here worthy of the promise of so great a work ? Or who does <lb/>
            not know that barbarisms are committed, some in writing, <lb/>
            others in speaking ? (because what is written incorrectly must <lb/>
            also be spoken incorrectly; though he who speaks incorrectly <lb/>
            may not necessarily make mistakes in writing;) the first <lb/>
            sort being caused by addition, curtailment, substitution, or <lb/>

            bles, aspiration, or other faults of sound ? 7. But though these <lb/>
            may be small matters, boys are still to be taught, and we put <lb/>
            grammarians in mind of their duty. If any one of them, how­ <lb/>
            ever, shall not be sufficiently accomplished, but shall have just <lb/>
            entered the vestibule of the art, he will have to confine himself <lb/>
            within those rules which are published in the little manuals of <lb/>
            professors; the more learned will add many other instructions, <lb/>
            the very first of which will be this, that we understand bar­ <lb/>
            barisms as being of several kinds. 8. One, with reference to <lb/>
            country, such as is committed when a person inserts an African <lb/>
            or Spanish term in Latin composition; as when the iron ring, <lb/>
            with which wheels are bound, is called canthus,* though Persius <lb/>
            uses this as a received word; as when Catullus t got the word <lb/>
            ploxenum, a a box," on the banks of the Po; and in the speech of <lb/>
            Labienus, (if it be not rather the speech of Cornelius Gallus,)‡ <lb/>
            the word casnar, " a parasite," is brought from Gaul § against <lb/>
            Pollio; as to mastruca, " a shaggy garment," which is a <lb/>
            Sardinian word, Cicero || has used it purposely in jest. 9. <lb/>
            Another kind of barbarism is that which we regard as proceed­ <lb/>
            ing from the natural disposition, when he, by whom anything <lb/>
            has been uttered insolently, or threateningly, or cruelly, is <lb/>
            said to have spoken like a barbarian. 10. The third kind <lb/>
            of barbarism is that of which examples are everywhere abun­ <lb/>
            dant, and which every one can form for himself, by adding <lb/>
            a letter or syllable to any word he pleases, or taking one away, <note type="footnote"> * Quintilian evidently signifies that canthus is a Spanish word, <lb/>
            though the Greeks claim it as theirs. Regius. Turnebus says that it <lb/>
            occurs in the Iliad, but is mistaken, for it is not to be found in Homer <lb/>
            at all. Casaubon, on Persius, v. 71, where it occurs, observes that it <lb/>
            is used by no Greek writer except the grammarians. Burmann sup­ <lb/>
            poses the word to be of Celtic origin. </note><note type="footnote"> t lxxxix. 6, 6 : Gingivas verb ploxeni habet veteris. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Of this speech I find no mention elsewhere. Labienus (the son <lb/>
            probably of him who deserted the party of Julius Cæsar, A.U.C. 703), <lb/>
            and Cornelius Gallus, both enemies of Mark Antony, may both have <lb/>
            composed severe speeches against his friend Pollio. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> I It appears strange that Quintilian, in bringing this word from <lb/>
            Gaul, not only differs from Varro, who, de L. L. i. 6, attributes it to <lb/>
            the Osci, but does not even allude to a writer of so high authority on <lb/>
            such a point. Festus agrees with Varro respecting the origin of the <lb/>

            or substituting one for another, or putting one in a place where <lb/>
            it is not right for it to be. 11. But some grammarians, to <lb/>
            make a show of learning, are accustomed, for the most part, to <lb/>
            take examples of these from the poets, and find fault with the <lb/>
            authors whom they interpret. A boy ought to know, however, <lb/>
            that such forms of speech, in writers of poetry, are con­ <lb/>
            sidered as deserving of excuse, or even of praise; and learners <lb/>
            must be taught less common instances. IS. Thus Tinea of <lb/>
            Placentia* (if we believe Hortensius, who finds fault with <lb/>
            him) was guilty of two barbarisms in one word, saying precula <lb/>
            instead of pergula; first, by the change of a letter, putting c <lb/>
            for g, and secondly, by transposition, placing r before the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding e. But Ennius, when committing a like double fault, <lb/>
            by saying Metieo Fufetieo,† is defended on the ground of <lb/>
            poetic licence. 13. In prose, too, there are certain received <lb/>
            changes ; for Cicero ‡ speaks of an army of Canopitœ, though <lb/>
            the people of the city call it Canobus; and many writers have <lb/>
            authorized Tharsomenus for Thrasymenus, § although there is <lb/>
            a transposition in it. Other words suffer similar treatment; <lb/>
            for if assentior, " I assent," be thought the proper way of <lb/>
            spelling that word, Sisenna has said assentio, and many have <lb/>
            followed him and analogy; or, if assentio be deemed the right <lb/>
            method, the other form, assentior, is supported by common <lb/>
            practice. 14. Yet the prim and dull || teacher will suppose <lb/>
            that there is either curtailment in the one case, or addition <lb/>
            in the other. I need hardly add that some forms, which, <lb/>
            taken singly, are doubtless faulty, are used in composition <lb/>
            without blame. 15. For dua, tre, and pondo, are barbarisms <lb/>
            of discordant gender; yet the compounds duapondo, " two <lb/>
            pounds, and trepondo, " three pounds," have ¶ been used by <note type="footnote"> * He is mentioned by Cicero, Brat. a. 46. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t If the poems of Ennius were extant, the two faults of which he is <lb/>

            absurd to say that a barbarism, which is incorrectness in a <lb/>
            single word, may be committed in number and gender, like a <lb/>
            solecism; yet scala, "stairs," and scopa, "a broom," in the <lb/>

            are expressed in the singular, and singulars in the plural; and <lb/>
            those who have used gladia, " swords," have committed a fault <lb/>

          <p>Faults which are committed in speaking require more <lb/>
            sagacity in criticising them, because examples of them cannot <lb/>
            be given from writing, except when they have occurred in <lb/>
            verses, as the division of the diphthong in Europai, and the <lb/>

            discover. Spalding would read Appî, if it were certain that the use of <lb/>
            such genitives in î. (not ii) had been altogether laid aside in the time <lb/>
            of Quintilian. " The genitive of words in ius and ium was not formed <lb/>
            in ii in the best age of the Latin language, but in t alone, e.g. fili, <lb/>
            ingeni, Tulli. So at least it was pronounced in the poets before and <lb/>
            during the Augustan age; Bentley, Ter. Andr. ii. 1. 20. Of the poets <lb/>
            Propertius first used the form in it, which is common in Ovid and <lb/>
            later poets. It was probably pronounced i in prose, even if written ii. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            into one, and then circumflexing it, people commit two errors. <lb/>
            24. But this happens far more frequently in Greek words, as <lb/>
            Atreus, which, when I was young, the most learned old men <lb/>
            used to pronounce with an acute on the first syllable,- so that <lb/>
            the second was necessarily grave, as was also that of Tern, <lb/>
            and Nereus. Such have been the rules respecting accents. <lb/>
            25. But I am quite aware that certain learned men, and some <lb/>
            grammarians also, teach and speak in such a manner as to <lb/>
            terminate a word at times with an acute sound, for the sake <lb/>
            of preserving certain distinctions in words, as in circum in these <lb/>
            lines, <lb/>
            Quæ circum, litora, circum <lb/>
            Piscosos scopulos, <lb/>
            lest, if they make the second syllable in circum grave, a circus <lb/>
            might seem to be meant, not a circuit. 26. Quantum and <lb/>
            quale, also, when asking a question, they conclude with a <lb/>
            grave accent; when making a comparison, with an acute; a <lb/>
            practice, however, which they observe almost only in adverbs <lb/>
            and pronouns; in other words they follow the old custom. <lb/>
            27. To me it appears to make a difference, that in these <lb/>
            phrases we join the words; for when I say circum litora, I <lb/>
            enunciate the words as one, without making any distinction <lb/>
            between them; and thus one syllable only, as in a single word, <lb/>
            is acute. The same is the case in this hemistich, <lb/>
            Trojæ qui primus ab oris. † <lb/>
            28. It sometimes happens, too, that the law of the metre <lb/>
            alters the accent: as, <lb/>
            Pecudes, pictæque volucres ; <note type="footnote"> the MSS. Mancipi remained in common use." Zumpt's Latin Gram­ <lb/>
            mar, sect ix. </note><note type="footnote"> * " So far," says Spalding, "is clear, that they made the first syllable <lb/>
            acute; but whether they pronounced the rest of the word as two <lb/>
            syllables, or as one, is uncertain." He is inclined, however, to think <lb/>
            that they made three syllables, because Quintilian calls the next <lb/>
            syllable the " second," whereas, if there had been but two, he would <lb/>
            probably have said the lost. Yet we cannot think this argument of <lb/>
            much weight when we see that Quintilian speaks of the "second" <lb/>
            syllable of circum in sect. 25. The genitive, from what Quintilian <lb/>
            says, they appear to have contracted into two syllables. The poets <lb/>
            contracted or not, in all the cases, as they pleased; but Quintilian is <lb/>
            speaking of pronunciation in prose. </note><note type="footnote"> t Qui, in go primus, loses its accent by almost coalescing with the </note> <pb n="44"/>

            will not vary from the rule; or, if custom ‡ shall triumph, the <lb/>
            old law of the language will be abolished; the observation of <lb/>
            which law is more difficult among the Greeks, (because they <lb/>
            have several modes of speaking, which they call dialects, and <lb/>
            because what is wrong in one is sometimes right in another ;§) <lb/>
            but among us the principle of accentuation is very simple. <lb/>
            30. For in every word the acuted syllable is confined within <lb/>
            the number of three syllables, || whether those three be the <lb/>
            only syllables in the word, or the three last; and of these, <lb/>
            the acuted syllable is either the next, or next but one, to <lb/>
            the last. Of the three syllables of which [ am speaking, <lb/>
            moreover, the middle one will be long, or acute, or circumflex; <lb/>
            a short syllable in that position will, of course, have a grave <lb/>
            sound, and will accordingly acute the one that stands before <lb/>
            it, that is, the third from the end. 31. But in every word <lb/>
            there is an acute syllable, though never more than one; nor <lb/>
            is that one ever the last, and consequently in dissyllables it is <lb/>
            the first. Besides there is never in the same word one syllable <lb/>
            circum flexed and another acuted, for the same syllable that is <lb/>
            circumflexed is also acuted;¶ neither of the two, therefore, <note type="footnote">following word, so that of the three syllables it is only pri that has <lb/>

          <p>32 In sounds also occur those faults of utterance and pro­ <lb/>
            nunciation, of which specimens cannot be given in writing; <lb/>
            the Greeks, who are more happy in inventing names, call them <lb/>
            iotacisms, lambdacisms, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσχνότητες</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλατείασμοι</foreign>: * as also <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰοιλοστομία</foreign>, when the voice is heard, as it were, in the depths <lb/>
            of the throat. 32. There are also certain peculiar and inex­ <lb/>
            pressible sounds, for which we sometimes find fault with whole <lb/>
            nations. All the incorrectnesses, then, which we have men­ <lb/>
            tioned above, being removed, there will result that which is <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀϱθοέπεια</foreign>, that is, a correct and clear utterance of words <lb/>
            with an agreeableness of sound; for so may a right pronuncia­ <lb/>
            tion be termed.</p>
          <p>34. All other faults arise out of more words than one; <lb/>
            among which faults is the solecism; though about this also <lb/>
            there has been controversy. For even those who admit that <lb/>
            it lies in the composition of words, yet contend that, because <lb/>
            it may be corrected by the amendment of a single word, it is <lb/>
            the incorrectness of a word, and not a fault in composition; <lb/>
            35. since, whether amara corticis or medio cortice constitutes <lb/>
            a fault in gender, (to neither of which do I object, Virgilt <lb/>
            being the author of both ; but let us suppose that one of the <lb/>
            two is incorrect.) the alteration of one word, in which the fault <lb/>
            lay, produces correctness of phraseology; so that we have <lb/>
            amari corticis or media cortice. This is a manifest misrepre­ <lb/>
            sentation ; for neither of the words is wrong, taken separately, <lb/>
            but the fault lies in them when put together; and it is a fault <lb/>
            therefore of phrase. 36. It is, however, a question of greater <lb/>
            sagacity, whether a solecism can be committed in a single <lb/>
            word ; as if a man, calling one person to him, should say venite, <note type="footnote"> * An iotacism is when the sound of the iota is too much protracted, <lb/>
            as when, for Troia, Maia, we say Troiia Maiia, doubling, as it were, <lb/>

            ellucit. See Isidore and Diomed, 11. cc., and Erasmus, Dial. de Pro­ <lb/>

            of the voice from too great contraction of the throat, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλατείασμος</foreign> <lb/>
            being the opposite fault, when, from the mcuth opening too widely, <lb/>
            the sound is too full and broad. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ecl. vi. 62, 63; Georg. ii. 74. </note> <pb n="46"/>

            or, sending several away from him, should say abi, or discede; <lb/>
            or, moreover, when an answer does not agree with the question, <lb/>
            as if to a person saying quem vides ? you should reply ego. <lb/>
            Some also think that the same fault is committed in gesture, <lb/>
            when one thing is signified by the voice, and another by a nod <lb/>
            or by the hand. 37. With this opinion I do not altogether <lb/>
            agree, nor do I altogether dissent from it; for I allow that a <lb/>
            solecism may occur in one word, but not unless there be some­ <lb/>
            thing having the force of another word, to which the incorrect <lb/>
            word may be referred; so that a solecism arises from the <lb/>
            union- of things by which something is signified or some <lb/>
            intention manifested; and, that I may avoid all cavilling, it <lb/>
            sometimes occurs in one word, but never in a word by itself.</p>
          <p>38. But under how many, and what forms, the solecism <lb/>
            occurs, is not sufficiently agreed. Those who speak of it most <lb/>
            fully make the nature of it fourfold, like that of the barbar <lb/>
            ism;t so that it may be committed by addition, as, Veni de <lb/>
            Susis in Alexandriam; by retrenchment, as Ambulo viam, <lb/>
            .Egypto venio; ne hoc fecit; 39. by transposition, by which the <lb/>
            order of words is confused, as, Quoque ego; Enim hoc voluit; <lb/>
            Autem non habuit; under which head, whether igitur, placed <lb/>
            at the beginning of a phrase, ought to be included, may <lb/>
            be a matter of dispute, because I see that eminent authors <lb/>
            have been of opposite opinions as to the practice, it being <lb/>
            common among some, while it is never found in others. 40. <lb/>
            These three sorts of irregularity some distinguish from the <lb/>
            solecism, and call a fault of addition "a pleonasm," of retrench­ <lb/>
            ment “an ellipsis, ot inversion “an anastrophe, and allege <lb/>
            that if these fall under the head of solecism, the hyperbaton <lb/>
            may be included under the same title. 41. Substitution is, <lb/>
            without dispute, when one thing is put for another; an irre­ <lb/>
            gularity which we find affecting all the parts of speech, but <lb/>
            most frequently the verb, because it has most modifications; <lb/>
            and accordingly, under the head of substitution, occur sole­ <lb/>
            cisms in gender, tense, persons, moods, (or states, or qualities, <lb/>
            if any one wish that they should be so called,) being six, or, <lb/>

            which mention has just been made, there will be so many sorts <lb/>
            of errors liable to be committed), as well as in numbers, of <lb/>
            which we have the singular and plural, the Greeks also the <lb/>
            dual. 42. There have, indeed, been some who assigned us <lb/>
            also a dual, scripsere, legere; a termination which was merely <lb/>
            a softening for the sake of avoiding roughness of sound, as, <lb/>
            among the old writers, malè merere for malè mereris; and <lb/>
            thus what they call the dual consists in that one sort of termi­ <lb/>
            nation only, whereas among the Greeks it is found not only <lb/>
            through almost the whole system of the verb, but also in nouns; <lb/>
            though even so the use of it is very rare. 43. But in no one <lb/>
            of our authors is this distinction of ending to be discovered; <lb/>
            on the contrary, the phrases, Devenere locos, Conticuere om­ <lb/>
            nes, Consedere duces, show us plainly that no one of them <lb/>
            refers to two persons only; dixere, too, though Antonius Rufus* <lb/>
            gives it as an example of the contrary, the crierf pronounces <lb/>
            concerning more advocates than two. 44. Does not Livy, <lb/>
            also, near the beginning of his first book, say, Tenuere areem <lb/>
            Sabini, and a little afterwards, In adversum Romani subiere ? <lb/>
            But whom shall I follow in preference to Cicero, who, in his <lb/>
            Orator,‡ says, “I do not object to scripsere, though I consider <lb/>
            scripserunt to be preferable ? ”</p>
          <p>45. In appellative and other nouns, likewise, the solecism <lb/>
            shows itself in regard to gender, and to number, but especially <lb/>
            to case. Whichsoever of those three shall be put in the place of <lb/>
            another, the error may be placed under this head ; as also <lb/>
            incorrectnesses in the use of comparatives and superlatives ;§ <note type="footnote"> * Of Antonius Rufus there is no mention in any other writer, <lb/>

            to quantity, such as magnum peculiolum, there will be some <lb/>
            who will think it a solecism, because a diminution is used <lb/>
            instead of the integral word ; but for my own part, I doubt <lb/>
            whether I should not rather call it a misapplication of a word, <lb/>
            for it is a departure from the signification; and the impropriety <lb/>
            of a solecism is not an error as to the sense of a word, but in <lb/>
            the junction of words. 47. In respect to the participle errors <lb/>
            are committed in gender and case, as in the noun; in tense, as <lb/>
            in the verb; and in number, as in both. The pronoun, also, <lb/>
            has gender, number, and case, all of which admit mistakes of <lb/>
            this kind. 48. Solecisms are committed, too, and in great <lb/>
            numbers, as to parts of speech,! but it is not enough merely to <lb/>
            remark this generally, lest the pupil should think a solecism <lb/>
            committed only where one part of speech is put for another, <lb/>
            as a verb where there ought to have been a noun, or an adverb <lb/>
            where there ought to have been a pronoun, and the like. <lb/>
            49. For there are some nouns cognate, as they say, that is, of <lb/>
            the same kind, in regard to which he who shall use another <lb/>
            species than that which he ought to use, will be guilty of no <lb/>
            less an error than if he were to use a word of another genus. <lb/>
            50. Thus an and aut are both conjunctions, yet you would be <lb/>
            incorrect in asking, hie, aut ille, sit ? Ne and non are both <lb/>
            adverbs, yet he who should say non feceris for ne feceris, would <lb/>
            fall into a similar error, since the one is an adverb of denying, <lb/>
            the other of forbidding. I will add another example; intro <lb/>
            and intus are both adverbs of place ; yet eo intus, and intro <lb/>
            sum, are solecisms. 51. The same faults may be committed in <lb/>

          <p>52. There are expressions, however, which have the appear <lb/>
            ance of solecisms, and yet cannot be called faulty, as tragœdia <lb/>
            Thyestes, Ludi Floralia, and Megalesia; for though these <lb/>
            modes of expression have fallen into disuse in later times, <lb/>
            there was never any variation from them among the ancients <lb/>
            They shall therefore be called figures; figures more common <lb/>
            indeed among the poets, but allowable also to writers and <lb/>
            speakers in prose. 63. But a figure will generally have some­ <lb/>
            thing right for its basis, as I shall show in that part of my <lb/>
            work which I just before promised.- Yet what is now called <lb/>
            a figure will not be free from the fault of solecism, if it be <lb/>
            used by any one unknowingly .f 54. Of the same sort, though, <lb/>
            as I have already said,‡ they have nothing of figure, are names <lb/>
            with a feminine termination which males have, and those with <lb/>
            a masculine termination which females have. But of the <lb/>
            solecism I shall say no more; for I have not undertaken to <lb/>
            write a treatise on grammar, though, as grammar met me in <lb/>

            to it.</p>
          <p>55. In continuation, that I may follow the course which I <lb/>
            prescribed§ to myself, let me repeat that words are either Latin <lb/>
            or foreign. Foreign words, like men, and like many of our <lb/>
            institutions, have come to us, I might almost say, from all <lb/>
            nations. 56. I say nothing of the Tuscans, Sabines, and <note type="footnote">prehensionis unius I understand words joined, not separated, or to be <lb/>
            distinguished by commas, according to our fashion. Spalding. Positio <lb/>
            Spalding is inclined to take in the sense of casus, on the supposition <lb/>
            that expressions somewhat similar to ludi Floralia, and others noticed <lb/>
            in the next section, were what Quintilian had in view; but this notion <lb/>
            seems hardly compatible with the other words of the sentence, for, if <lb/>
            this were Qnintilian's meaning, why should sequentia and priora be <lb/>
            particularly specified I Turnebus seems to shoot nearer to the mark, <lb/>
            suggesting that Quintilian means such a mistake as a man would commit <lb/>
            in saying omnia prius experiri quàm armis sapientem decet instead <lb/>
            of arma. The French translator in Didot's edition, 1853, renders the <lb/>
            passage thus: “ Il y a aussi solécisme, lorsque, dans une phrase sans <lb/>

            and gurdus, a word which the common people use for foolish. <lb/>

            of mine is intended to refer chiefly to the Greek language ; <lb/>
            for it is from thence that the Roman language is, in a very <lb/>
            great degree, derived; and we use even pure Greek words, <lb/>
            where our own fail, as they also sometimes borrow from us. <lb/>
            Hence arises the question, whether it is proper that foreign <lb/>
            words should be declined with cases in the same way as our <lb/>
            own. 59. If you meet with a grammarian who is a lover of <lb/>
            the ancients, he will say that there should be no departure from <lb/>
            the Latin method; because, as there is in our language an <lb/>
            ablative case, which the Greeks have not, it is by no means <lb/>
            becoming for us to use one case of our own, and five Greek <lb/>
            cases. 60. And he would also praise the merit of those who <lb/>
            studied to increase the resources of the Latin language, and <lb/>
            asserted that they need not introduce foreign practices; under <lb/>

            not wonder that the forms Ænea and Anchisa were used by <lb/>
            most of the old writers: for, said they, if those words were <lb/>
            written as Mæcenas, Suffenas, Asprenas, they would end in <lb/>
            the genitive case, not with the letter e, but with the syllable <lb/>
            tis. 62. Hence, to Olympus and tyrannus they gave an acuted <lb/>
            middle syllable, because our language does not permit the first <lb/>
            syllable of a word, if short, to have an acute accent when two <lb/>
            long syllables follow.‡ 62. Thus the genitive had the forms <lb/>
            Achilli and Ulixi ;§ aud many others similar. The modern <lb/>
            grammarians have now made it a practice rather to give <lb/>
            Greek declensions to Greek nouns; a practice which cannot, <lb/>
            however, always be observed. For myself, I prefer following <lb/>

          <p>65. Simple words are what they are in their first position,­ <lb/>
            that is, in their own nature. Compound words are either <lb/>
            formed by subjoining words to prepositions, as innocent, (care <lb/>
            being taken that there be not two prepositions inconsistent <lb/>
            with each other, as imperterritus, t otherwise two may be at <lb/>
            times joined together, as incompositus, reconditus, and, a word <lb/>
            which Cicero uses, subabsurdum;) or they coalesce, as it were, <lb/>
            from two bodies into one, as maleficus. 66. For to form words <lb/>
            out of three constituent parts I should certainly not grant to <lb/>
            our language ; though Cicero says that capsis is compounded of <lb/>
            cape si vis ; ‡ and some are found to maintain that Lupercalia <lb/>
            also consists of three parts of speech, luere per caprum.§ <lb/>
            67. As to solitaurilia, it is now believed that it is for suove­ <lb/>
            taurilia, || and such indeed is the sacrifice, as it is described <lb/>
            also in Homer. ¶ But these words are constructed, not so <lb/>
            much of three words, as of parts of three words. Pacuvius <note type="footnote"> * Primd positione.] That is, in their nominative case, the form in <lb/>

            however appears to have formed compounds, most inelegantly <lb/>

            Repandirostrum, incurvicervicum pecus, <lb/>
            “The broad-nosed, crook-necked flock of Nereus." Corn. <lb/>
            pounds, however, are formed either of two entire Latin words, <lb/>
            as superfui, subterfugi, (though it is a question whether these <lb/>
            are indeed formed of entire words,*) of an entire and in­ <lb/>
            complete word, as malevolus; of an incomplete and entire. <lb/>
            word, as noctivagus; of two incomplete words, as pedissequus ; <lb/>
            of a Latin and a foreign word, as biclinium ; of a foreign and <lb/>
            a Latin word, as epitogium and Anticato; or of two foreign <lb/>
            words, as epirhedium, for though the preposition <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ</foreign> is Greek, <lb/>
            and rheda Gallic, and though neither the Greek nor the Gaul <lb/>
            uses the compound, yet the Romans have formed their word of <lb/>
            the two foreign words. 69. Frequently, too. the union causes a <lb/>
            change in the prepositions, as abstulit, aufugit, amisit, though <lb/>
            the preposition is merely ab, and coit, the preposition being <lb/>
            con ; and so ignavi, erepti, and similar compounds. 70. But the <lb/>
            composition of words in general is better suited to the Greeks ; <lb/>
            with us it is less successful; though I do not think that this <lb/>
            results from the nature of the language ; but we look with more <lb/>
            favour on foreign compounds; and, accordingly, while we ad­ <lb/>
            mire <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰυϱταύενα</foreign>, we hardly defend incurvicervicum from <lb/>
            derision.</p>
          <p>71. Words are proper when they signify that to which they <lb/>
            were first applied; metaphorical, when they have one signifi­ <lb/>
            cation by nature, and another in the place in which they are <lb/>
            used. Common words we use with greater safety; new ones <lb/>
            we do not form without some danger; for if they are well re­ <lb/>
            ceived, they add but little merit to our style, and, if rejected, <lb/>
            they turn to jokes against us. 72. Yet we must make <lb/>
            attempts; for, as Cicero says, even words which have seemed <lb/>
            harsh at first, become softened by use.</p>
          <p>As to the onomatopœia, it is by no means granted to our <note type="footnote"> * The prepositions super and subter have indeed lost their accent in <lb/>

          <p>1. By speakers, as well as writers, there are certain rules to <lb/>
            be observed. Language is based on reason, antiquity, autho­ <lb/>
            rity, custom. It is analogy, and sometimes etymology, that <lb/>
            affords the chief support to reason. A certain majesty, and, if <lb/>
            I may so express myself, religion, graces the antique. Autho. <lb/>
            rity is commonly sought in orators or historians ; for, as to the <lb/>
            poets, the obligation of the metre excuses their phraseology, <lb/>
            unless, occasionally, when, though the measure of the feet <lb/>
            offers no impediment to the choice of either of two expressions, <lb/>
            they fancifully prefer one to the other; as in the following <lb/>
            phrases : Imo de stirpe recisum, Æëriæ quo congessere palum­ <lb/>
            bes, Silice in nudd,t and the like ; since the judgment of men <lb/>
            eminent in eloquence is in place of reason, and even error is <lb/>
            without dishonour in following illustrious guides. Custom, <lb/>
            however, is the surest preceptor in speaking; and we must use <lb/>
            phraseology, like money, which has the public stamp.</p>
          <p>But all these particulars require great judgment, especially <lb/>
            analogy ; which, translating it closely from Greek into Latin, <lb/>
            people have called proportion. 4. What it requires is, that a <lb/>
            writer or speaker should compare whatever is at all doubtful, <lb/>
            with something similar concerning which there is no doubt, so <lb/>
            as to prove the uncertain by the certain. This is done in two <note type="footnote"> * IL iv. 125; Odyss. ix. 394. </note><note type="footnote"> t Virg. An. xii. 208 ; Ecl. iii. 69 ; L 15. Yet, with regard to stirps. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. VI ] </note> <lb/>
            ways: by a comparison of similar words, in respect chiefly <lb/>
            to their last syllables (for which reason the words that have but <lb/>
            one syllable are said not to be accountable to analogy), and by <lb/>
            looking to diminutives. 5. Comparison, in nouns, shows <lb/>
            either their gender or their declension ; their gender, as, when <lb/>
            it is inquired whether funis be masculine or feminine, panis <lb/>
            may be an object of comparison with it; their declension, as, <lb/>
            if it should be a subject of doubt whether we should say hac <lb/>
            domu or hac domo, and domuum or domorum, domus, anus, <lb/>
            manus may be compared with each other. 6. The formation <lb/>
            of diminutives shows only the gender of words, as (that I may <lb/>
            take the same word for an example) funiculus proves that funis <lb/>
            is masculine. 7. There is also similar reason for comparison <lb/>
            in verbs; as if any one, following the old writers, should pro­ <lb/>
            nounce fervere with the middle syllable short, he would be <lb/>
            convicted of speaking incorrectly, since all verbs which end <lb/>
            with the letters e and o in the indicative mood, when they <lb/>
            have assumed the letter e in the middle syllables in the infini­ <lb/>
            tive, have it necessarily long, as prandeo, pendeo, spondeo, <lb/>
            prandere, pende<foreign xml:lang="grc">̄</foreign>re, sponde<foreign xml:lang="grc">̄</foreign>re. 8. But those which have o <lb/>
            only in the indicative, when they end with the same letters in <lb/>
            the infinitive, shorten it, as lego, dico, curro, legere, dicere, <lb/>
            currere ; although there occurs in Lucilius, <lb/>
            Fervit aqua et fervet ; fervit nunc, fervet ad annum. <lb/>
            “ The water boils and will boil; it boils now, and will boil for a year.- <lb/>
            But with all respect to a man of such eminent learning, if <lb/>
            he thinks fervit similar to currit and legit, fervo will be a word <lb/>
            like curro and lego, a word which has never been heard by <lb/>
            me. But this is not a just comparison; for servit is like <lb/>
            fervit,* and he that follows this analogy must say fervire as <lb/>
            well as servire. 10. The present indicative also is sometimes <lb/>
            discovered from the other moods and tenses; for I remember <lb/>
            that some people who had blamed me for using the word <lb/>
            pepigi, were convinced by me of their error; they bad allowed, <lb/>
            indeed, that the best authors had used pepigi, but denied that <lb/>
            analogy permitted its use, since the present indicative paciscor, <lb/>
            as it had the form of a passive verb, made in the perfect tense <lb/>
            pactus sum. 11. But I, besides adducing the authority of <note type="footnote"> * A very proper observation of Quintilian ; for when did the termi <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.I. </note> <lb/>
            orators and historians, maintained that pepigi was also sup­ <lb/>
            ported by analogy; for, as we read in the Twelve Fables, ni <lb/>
            ita pagunt, I found cadunt similar to pagunt, whence the <lb/>
            present indicative, though it had fallen into disuse through <lb/>
            time, was evidently pago, like cado; and it was therefore <lb/>
            certain that we say pepigi like cecidi. 12. But we must re­ <lb/>
            member that the course of analogy cannot be traced through <lb/>
            all the parts of speech, as it is in many cases at variance with <lb/>
            itself.- Learned men, indeed, endeavour to justify some <lb/>
            departures from it, as, when it is remarked how much lepus and <lb/>
            lupus, though of similar terminations in the nominative, differ <lb/>
            in their cases and numbers, they reply that they are not of the <lb/>
            same sort, since lepus is epicene, and lupus masculine; <lb/>
            although Varro, in the book in which he relates the origin of <lb/>
            the city of Rome, uses lupus as feminine, following Ennius and <lb/>
            Fabius Pictor. 13. But those same grammarians, when they <lb/>
            are asked why aper makes apri, and pater patris, assert that <lb/>
            the first is declined absolutely, and the second with reference <lb/>
            to something; t and, besides, as both are derived from the <lb/>
            Greek, they recur to the rule that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατϱὸς</foreign> gives patris, and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰάπϱου</foreign> apri. 14. But how will they escape from the fact <lb/>
            that nouns, which end with the letters u and a in the nomina <lb/>
            tive singular, never, even though feminine, end with the <lb/>
            syllable ris in the genitive, ‡ yet that Venus makes Veneris; <lb/>
            and that, though nouns ending in es have various endings in the <lb/>
            genitive, yet their genitive never ends in that same syllable ris, <lb/>
            when, nevertheless, Ceres obliges us to say Cereris? 15. And <lb/>
            what shall I say of those parts of speech, which, though all of <lb/>
            similar commencement, proceed with different inflexions, as <lb/>
            Alba makes Albani and Albenses, Volo, volui and volavi ? <note type="footnote"> * To say that analogy is at variance with itself is an incorrect mode <lb/>

            lego legi, pono posui, frango fregi, laudo laudavi ; 16. since <lb/>
            analogy was not sent down from heaven, when men were first <lb/>
            made, to give them rules for speaking, but was discovered after <lb/>
            men had begun to speak, and after it was observed how each <lb/>
            word in speaking terminated. It is not therefore founded on <lb/>
            reason, but on example; nor is it a law for speaking, but the <lb/>
            mere result of observation; so that nothing but custom has <lb/>
            been the origin of analogy. 17. Yet some people adhere to it <lb/>
            with a most unpleasantly perverse attachment to exactness; so <lb/>
            that they will say audaciter in preference to audacter. though all <lb/>
            orators adopt the latter, and emicavit instead of emicuit, centre <lb/>
            instead of coire. Such persons we may allow to say audivisse, <lb/>

            way is the right way; who will deny it ? but a smoother and <lb/>
            more beaten road is close by the side of it. There is nothing <lb/>
            however, with which I am more offended, than that these men, <lb/>
            led away by oblique cases, permit themselves, I do not say not <lb/>
            to find, but even to alter nominative cases, as when ebur and <lb/>
            robur, so spoken and written by the greatest authors, are made <lb/>
            to change the vowel of the second syllable into o, because their <lb/>
            genitives are roboris and eboris, and because sulfur and jecur <lb/>
            preserve the vowel u in the genitive. For which reason also <lb/>
            jecur and femur have raised disputes. 23. This change of <lb/>
            theirs is not less audacious than if they were to substitute the <lb/>
            letter o for u in the genitive case of sulfur and guttur, because <lb/>
            eboris and roboris are formed with o; after the example of <lb/>
            Antonius Gnipho,‡ who acknowledges that robur and ebur are <lb/>
            proper words, and even marmur, but would have the plurals <lb/>
            of them to be robura, ebura, marmura. 24. But if they <lb/>
            had paid attention to the affinity of letters, they would have <lb/>
            understood that roboris is as fairly formed from robur as <lb/>

            the oblique cases, as Virgo, Juno; fusus, lusus; cuspis, puppis; <lb/>
            and a thousand others ? It happens, too, that some nouns are <lb/>
            not used in the plural, others not in the singular; some are <lb/>
            indeclinable; some depart altogether from the form of their <lb/>

            in verbs, as fero, tuli, of which the preterperfect is found.. <lb/>
            and nothing more. Nor is it of much importance, whether <lb/>
            those unused parts are actually not in existence, or whether <lb/>
            they are too harsh to be used; for what, for example, wilt <lb/>
            progenies make in the genitive singular, or what will spes make <lb/>
            in the genitive plural? Or how will quire and ruere, form <lb/>
            themselves in the perfect passive, or in the passive participles ? <lb/>
            27. It is needless to advert to other words, when it is even <lb/>
            uncertain whether senatus makes senatus senatui, or senati <lb/>
            senato. t It appears to me, therefore, to have been not <lb/>
            unhappily remarked that it is one thing to speak Latin, and <lb/>
            another to speak grammar. Of analogy I have now said <lb/>
            enough, and more than enough.</p>
          <p>Etymology, which inquires into the origin of words, is called <lb/>
            by Cicero notation, because its designation in Aristotle is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύμβολον</foreign>, that is, nota; for to a literal rendering of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐτυμολογία</foreign>, <lb/>
            which would be veriloquium, Cicero himself, who formed that <lb/>
            word, is averse. There are some, who, looking rather to the <lb/>
            meaning of the word, call it origination. 29. This part of <lb/>
            grammar is sometimes of the utmost use ; as often, indeed, as <lb/>
            the matter, concerning which there is any dispute, stands in <lb/>
            need of interpretation; as when Marcus Cœlius would prove <lb/>
            that he was a homo frugi, “ a frugal man," not because he was <lb/>
            temperate, (for on that point he could not speak falsely,) but <lb/>
            because he was profitable to many, that is fructuosus, from <lb/>
            whence, he said, was derived frugality.‡ A place is accordingly <note type="footnote"> * The preterperfect and the tenses formed from it. The text is, <lb/>
            fero, tuli, cujus prœteritum perfectum, et ulteriu non invenitur, of which, <lb/>
            an Spalding says, the construction is not very clear. He, however, <lb/>
            rightly determines that tuli must be the antecedent to cujus, and not <lb/>
            unhappily proposes to read nil for non. </note><note type="footnote"> t The old grammarians (see Putsch, pp. 10 and 712) say that the <lb/>

            it endeavours to distinguish barbarous from polite words; as <lb/>
            when a question arises whether Sicily should be called <lb/>
            Triquetra or Triquedra, * and whether we should say meridies <lb/>
            or medidies ;t and similar questions concerning other words <lb/>
            which yield to custom. 31. But it carries with it much learn­ <lb/>
            ing, whether we employ it in treating of words sprung from <lb/>
            the Greek, which are very numerous, especially those inflected <lb/>
            according to the Æolic dialect, to which our language has most <lb/>

            or syllables. In this pursuit, through weakness of judgment, <lb/>
            they run into the most contemptible absurdities. Let consul be <lb/>
            (I make no objection) from “ consulting " or from judging," for <lb/>

            lucus, " a grove," from luceo, “ to shine," because, being thick <lb/>

            school," from ludo, “ to play," because it is as far as possible <lb/>
            from play ? As Ditis, “ Pluto," from dives, “rich," because <lb/>
            he is by no means rich? Or shall we allow homo, “ man,” to <lb/>
            be from humus,“ the ground," because he was sprung from <lb/>
            the ground, as if all animals had not the same origin, or as if <lb/>
            the first men had given a name to the ground before they gave <lb/>
            one to themselves? Shall we allow verba, “ words,” to be <lb/>
            from aër verberatus, “ beaten air ?" 35. Let us go on, and <lb/>
            we shall get so far that stella, “ a star," will be believed to <lb/>
            be luminis stilla, “ a drop of light," the author of which <lb/>
            derivation, an eminent man in literature, it would be un­ <lb/>
            generous for me to name in regard to a point on which he <lb/>
            is censured by me. 36. But those who have recorded such <lb/>
            etymologies in books have themselves set their names to <lb/>
            them; and Caius Granius† thought himself extremely clever <lb/>
            for saying that cælibes, “ bachelors," was the same as cœlites, <lb/>
            “ inhabitants of heaven," because they are alike free from <lb/>
            a most heavy burden, resting his derivation, too, on an ar­ <lb/>
            gument from the Greek, for he affirmed that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠϊθέους</foreign>‡ was <lb/>
            used in the same sense. Nor does Modestus§ yield to him <lb/>
            in imagination, for he says that because Saturn cut off the <lb/>
            genitalia of Cœlus, men who have no wives are, therefore, <lb/>
            called cœlibes. 37. Lucius Æliusll declares that pituita, <lb/>

            origin from something, but demand no exercise of ingenuity, <lb/>
            for which, indeed, except on doubtful points, there is no <lb/>
            opportunity in these investigations.</p>
          <p>39. Words derived from antiquity have not only illustrious <lb/>
            patrons, but also confer on style a certain majesty, not un­ <lb/>
            attended with pleasure; for they have the authority of age, <lb/>
            and, as they have been disused for a time, bring with them <lb/>
            a charm similar to that of novelty. 40. But there is need <lb/>
            of moderation in the use of them, in order that they may <lb/>
            not occur too frequently, nor show themselves too manifestly, <lb/>
            since nothing is more detestable than affectation ; nor should <lb/>
            they be taken from a remote and already forgotten age, as <lb/>
            are topper, " quickly," antigerio, “ very much, ”‡ exa.nclare, “to <lb/>
            draw out," prosapia, “ a race," and the verses of the Salii, <lb/>
            which are scarcely understood by the priests themselves. 41. <lb/>
            Those verses, however, religion forbids to be changed ; and we <lb/>
            must use what has been consecrated ; but how faulty is speech, <lb/>
            of which the greatest virtue is perspicuity, if it needs an inter­ <lb/>
            preter! Consequently, as the oldest of new words will be <lb/>
            the best, so the newest of old words will be ile best. <note type="footnote"> * I. 4, 25. </note><note type="footnote"> + Ut a velocitate dicitur velox.] The substanti ve is generally con­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. VL] </note> <lb/>
            42. The case is similar with regard to authority; for though <lb/>
            he may seem to commit no fault who uses those words which <lb/>
            the greatest writers have handed down to him, yet it is of <lb/>
            much importance for him to consider, not only what words <lb/>
            they used, but how far they gave a sanction to them; for <lb/>
            no one would now tolerate from us tuburchinabundus, “ de­ <lb/>
            vouring," or lurchinabundus, “ voracious," though Cato was the <lb/>
            father of them ; nor would people endure lodices, “ blankets," <lb/>
            in the masculine gender, though that gender pleases Pollio; <lb/>
            nor gladiola for “ little swords," though Messala has used it; <lb/>
            nor parricidatus, “ parricide," which was thought scarcely <lb/>
            endurable in Cælius ;* nor would Calvust induce me to use <lb/>
            collos, “ necks all which words, indeed, those authors them­ <lb/>
            selves would not now use.</p>
          <p>43. There remains, therefore, custom, for it would be almost <lb/>
            ridiculous to prefer the language which men have spoken rather <lb/>
            than that which they now speak; what else, indeed, is old <lb/>
            language, but the old manner of speaking? But even for <lb/>
            following custom judgment is necessary; and we must settle, <lb/>
            in the first place, what that is which we call custom; 44. for if <lb/>
            custom be merely termed that which the greater number do, it <lb/>
            will furnish a most dangerous rule, not only for language, but, <lb/>
            what is of greater importance, for life. For where is there so <lb/>
            much virtue that what is right can please the majority ?‡ As, <lb/>
            therefore, to pluck out hairs,§ to cut the hair of the head in a <lb/>
            succession of rings,|| and to drink to excess in the bath,¶ what­ <lb/>

            the custom, because no one of them is undeserving of censure, <lb/>
            though we bathe and clip our hair, and take our meals together <lb/>
            according to custom, so, in speaking, it is not whatever has <lb/>
            become a vicious practice with many, that is to be received as <lb/>

            this subject, 33—35.</p>
          <p>1. SINCE we have mentioned what rules are to be followed <lb/>
            in speaking, we must now specify what are to be observed by <lb/>
            writers. What the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθογραφία</foreign>, we may call the <lb/>
            art of writing correctly; an art which does not consist in <lb/>
            knowing of what letters every syllable is composed (for this <lb/>
            study is beneath the profession even of the grammarian), but <lb/>
            exercises its whole subtilty, in my opinion, on dubious points. <lb/>
            2. As it is the greatest of folly to place a mark† on all long <lb/>
            syllables, since most of them are apparent from the very <lb/>
            nature of the word that is written, yet it is at times necessary <lb/>
            to mark them, as when the same letter gives sometimes one <lb/>
            sense and sometimes another, according as it is short or long ; <lb/>
            thus malus is distinguished by a mark, to show whether it <lb/>
            means “ a tree " or “a bad man;" 3. palm, too, signifies one <lb/>
            thing when its first syllable is long, and another when its <lb/>
            second is so; and when the same letter is short in the <lb/>
            nominative and long in the ablative, we have generally to <lb/>
            be informed by this mark which quantity we are to adopt. <note type="footnote"> * The customary language of the multitude, therefore, is not to be <lb/>
            our example. </note><note type="footnote"> t Apicem.] Probably, from the name, something similar to the <lb/>
            mark with which we distinguish the ablative case of the first declen <lb/>
            sion. Hence it appears that it was customary to use distinctive marks <lb/>
            for words similarly spelled, but of different signification. </note> <pb n="65"/>
            <note type="margin"> OR. VII.] </note> </p>
          <p>4. Grammarians have in like manner thought that the <lb/>
            following distinction should be observed; namely, that we <lb/>
            should write the preposition ex, if the word specto was com­ <lb/>
            pounded with it, with the addition of 8 in the second syllable, <lb/>
            exspecto; if pecto, without the 8. 5. It has been a distinction, <lb/>
            also, observed by many, that ad, when it was a preposition, <lb/>
            should take the letter d, but when a conjunction, the letter <lb/>
            t;* and that cum, if it signified time, should be written with <lb/>
            a q and two u's following, but if it meant accompaniment, <lb/>
            with a c. 6. Some other things were even more trifling than <lb/>
            these, as that quicquid should have a c for the fourth letter, <lb/>
            lest we should seem to ask a double question,† and that we <lb/>
            should write quotidie, not cotidie, to show that it was for quot <lb/>
            diebus. But these notions have already passed away among <lb/>
            other puerilities.</p>
          <p>7. It is however a question, in writing prepositions, whether <lb/>
            it is proper to observe the sound which they make when joined <lb/>
            to another word, or that which they make when separate, as, <lb/>
            for instance, when I pronounce the word obtinuit; for our <lb/>
            method of writing requires that the second letter should be b ; <lb/>
            while the ear catches rather the sound of p; ‡ 8. or when I say <lb/>
            immunis, for the letter n, which the composition of the word <lb/>
            requires, is influenced by the sound of the following syllable, <lb/>
            and changed into another m. 9. It is also to be observed, in <lb/>
            dividing compound words, whether you ought to attach the <lb/>
            middle consonant to the first or to the second syllable ; for <lb/>
            aruspex, as its latter part is from spectare, will assign the <lb/>
            letter 8 to the third syllable; abstemius, as it is formed of ab­ <lb/>
            stinentia temeti, “ abstinence from wine," will leave the s to the <lb/>
            first syllable. 10. As to k, I think it should not be used in <lb/>
            any words, except those which it denotes of itself, so that it <lb/>
            may be put alone. § This remark I have not omitted to make, <lb/>
            because there are some who think k necessary when a follows; <lb/>
            though there is the letter c, which suits itself to all vowels. <note type="footnote"> * The distinction, therefore, between ad and at, which we scrupu­ <lb/>

          <p>11. But orthography submits to custom, and has therefore free <lb/>
            quently been altered. I say nothing of those ancient times when <lb/>
            there were fewer letters, and when their shapes were different <lb/>
            from these of ours, and their natures also different, as that of o <lb/>
            among the Greeks, which was sometimes long and sometimes <lb/>
            short, and, as among us, was sometimes put for the syllable <lb/>
            which it expresses by its mere name.* 12. I say nothing also <lb/>
            of d, among the ancient Latins, being added t as the last <lb/>
            letter to a great number of words, as is apparent from the <lb/>
            rostral pillar erected to Caius Duellius in the forum; t nor <lb/>
            nor do I speak of g being used in the same manner,§ as, on <lb/>
            the pulvinar If of the Sun, which is worshipped near the temple <lb/>
            of Romulus, is read vesperug, which we take for vesperugo. <lb/>
            13. Nor is it necessary to say anything here of the interchange <lb/>
            of letters, of which I have spoken above for perhaps as they <lb/>
            wrote they also spoke. <note type="footnote"> * That is, for the interjection. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ut—d —ultimam adjectam.] How is this accusative governed ? Et <lb/>

            into his Florus, p. 156 ; and it is also to be found in Gruter, p. 404. <lb/>
            The letters are not yet obliterated ; and we read pugnandod for pug­ <lb/>
            nando ; marid for mari ; dictatored for dictatore ; in altod for in alto ; <lb/>
            navaled prædad for navali prædâ. More examples are given by Vossius, <lb/>
            Art. Gramm. ii. 14. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> § Of this addition I find no example in monumental inscriptions ; <lb/>
            and Quintilian himself appears to intimate that it was more rare than <lb/>
            the preceding. It is probable that the ancients, instead of vespere, <lb/>
            used vesperu, like noctu, an ablative case, as is proved, from Ennius, by <lb/>
            Vossius, de Anal. ii. 12. To this they added g, vesperug, which the <lb/>
            contemporaries of Quintilian erroneously supposed (for Quintilian <lb/>
            himself rejects the supposition) to be for vesperuginem, regarding it as <lb/>
            a curtailed instead of a lengthened word. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> || In what sense Quintilian uses this word is by no means clear. <lb/>
            That the letters were embroidered on the pulvinar, or couch, with the <lb/>
            needle, as Gesner in his Thesaurus supposes, seems a conjecture quite <lb/>
            inadmissible; but there were pulvinaria made of solid material, in <lb/>
            imitation of real couches, on which the letters might have been <lb/>
            engraved. But it appears best to take pulvinar in the sense of a <lb/>
            temple in which pulvinaria were spread. In Livy xxi. 62, we may <lb/>
            suppose pulvinarium to be used in this sense ; and we may also refer <lb/>
            to Tacitus, Ann. xv. 74. Spalding. This sense of the word is <lb/>
            abundantly established in Scheller's Latin Lexicon. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ I. 4,12-17. </note> <pb n="67"/>

          <p>14. It was for a long time a very common custom not to <lb/>
            double the semi vowels; while, on the other hand, even down <lb/>
            to the time of Accius and later, they wrote, as I have re­ <lb/>
            marked,. long syllables with two vowels. 15. Still longer <lb/>
            continued the practice of using e and i together, joining them <lb/>
            in the same manner as the Greeks in the diphthong <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ</foreign>. This <lb/>
            practice was adopted for a distinction in cases and numbers, <lb/>
            as Lucilius t admonishes us: <lb/>
            Jam pueri venere : E postremum facito, atque I, <lb/>
            Ut puerei plures fiant ;‡ <lb/>
            and afterwards, <lb/>
            Mendaci furique addes E, quum dare furei <lb/>
            Jusseris.§ <lb/>
            However this addition of e is both superfluous, since i has the <lb/>
            nature as well of a long as of a short letter, and also sometimes <lb/>
            inconvenient; for in those words which have e immediately <lb/>
            before the last syllable, and end with i long, we should use, if <lb/>
            we adopted that method, a double e, as aureM, argenteei, and <lb/>
            the like; and this would be extremely embarrassing to those <lb/>
            who are being taught to read; 17. as happens also among the <lb/>
            Greeks by the addition of the letter i, which they not only <lb/>
            write at the end of dative cases, but sometimes even in the <lb/>
            middle of a word, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΑΗΙΣΤΗΙ</foreign>,|| because etymology, in making <lb/>
            a division of the word into three syllables, requires that letter. <lb/>

            what later, the letter a, as often as it occurred between two long <lb/>
            vowels, or followed a long vowel, was doubled, as caussæ, cassus, <lb/>
            divissione; for that both he and Virgil wrote in this way, their <lb/>
            own hands show. 21. But those of a somewhat earlier period <lb/>
            wrote the word jussi, which we express with two s's, with only <lb/>
            one. That optimus, maximus, should take i as their middle letter, <lb/>
            which among the ancients was u, is said to have been brought <lb/>
            about by an inscription to Caius Cæsar.† 22. The word here we <lb/>
            now end with the letter e; but I still find in the books of the <lb/>
            old comic writers Heri ad me venit;‡ which same mode of <lb/>
            spelling is found in the letters of Augustus, which he wrote <lb/>
            or corrected with his own band, 23. Did not Cato the <lb/>
            Censor, also, for dicam and faciam, write dicem and faciem ?|| <lb/>
            and did he not observe the same method in other verbs which <lb/>
            terminate in a similar way ? This is indeed manifest from his <lb/>
            old writings, and is remarked by Messala in his book on the <lb/>
            letter s. Sibe and quase occur in the writings of many <lb/>

            ceruum and seruum with the letters u and o, ceruom, seruom, <lb/>

            not coalesce and be confounded in the same sound ; they are <lb/>
            now written with two u's, on the principle which I have <lb/>
            stated ;* though in neither way is the word which we conceive <lb/>
            exactly expressed. Nor was it without advantage that <lb/>
            Claudius introduced the Æolic letter† for such cases 27. It <lb/>
            is an improvement of the present day that we spell cui with <lb/>
            the three letters which I have just written; for in this word, <lb/>
            when we were boys, they used, making a very offensive sound, <lb/>
            qu and oi, only that it might be distinguished from qui.</p>
          <p>28. What shall I say, too, of words that are written other­ <lb/>
            wise than they are pronounced ? Gains is spelled with the <lb/>
            letter c, which, inverted, means a woman; for that women <lb/>
            were called Caiæ, as well as men Cam, appears even from our <lb/>
            nuptial ceremonies.‡ 29. Nor does Gneius assume that letter, in <lb/>
            designating a prænomen, with which it is sounded. § We read, <lb/>
            too, columna and consules || with the letter n omitted; and <lb/>
            Subura, when it is designated by three letters, takes c as the <lb/>
            third.¶ There are many other peculiarities of this kind; but I <lb/>
            fear that those which I have noticed have exceeded the limits <lb/>
            of so unimportant a subject.</p>
          <p>30. On all such points let the grammarian use his own <lb/>
            judgment, for in this department it ought to be of the greatest <lb/>
            authority. For myself, I think that all words, (unless custom <lb/>
            has ordered otherwise,) should be written in conformity with <lb/>
            their sound. 31. For this is the use of letters, to preserve <note type="footnote"> * See L 4, 11. </note><note type="footnote"> † See i. 4, 7. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡fn which the woman said, Ubi tu Caius, ibi ego CaMa. </note><note type="footnote"> § For it is marked Cn., not, as it ought to be, Gn.

          <p>32. These are the most important points as to speaking and <lb/>
            writing correctly. The other two departments, those of speak <lb/>
            ing with significancy * and elegance, I do not indeed take <lb/>
            away from the grammarians, but, as the duties of the rheto­ <lb/>

            important part of my work.</p>
          <p>33. Yet the reflection recurs to me, that some will regard <lb/>
            those matters of which I have just treated as extremely trifling, <lb/>
            and even as impediments to the accomplishment of anything <lb/>
            greater. Nor do I myself think that we ought to descend to <lb/>
            extreme solicitude, and puerile disputations, about them; I even <lb/>
            consider that the mind may be weakened and contracted by <lb/>
            being fixed upon them. 34. But no part of grammar will be <lb/>
            hurtful, except what is superfluous. Was Cicero the less of <lb/>
            an orator because he was most attentive to the study of <lb/>
            grammar, and because, as appears from his letters, he was a <lb/>
            rigid exactor, on all occasions, of correct language from his <lb/>
            son ? Did the writings of Julius Cæsar On Analogy diminish <lb/>
            the vigour of his intellect? Or was Messala less elegant as a <lb/>
            writer, because he devoted whole books, not merely to single <lb/>
            words, but even to single letters ? These studies are injurious, <lb/>
            not to those who pass through them, but to those who dwell <lb/>
            immoderately upon them.</p>

          <p>1. READING remains to be considered; in which how a boy <lb/>

            But it signifies something more; it implies speaking with propriety, <lb/>
            using language suited to the subject, and putting " proper words in <lb/>
            proper places." </note><note type="footnote"> t Versum distinguere.] That is, to divide a verse properly in reading, <lb/>
            so as not to run always on to the end of it, and there drop the voice. <lb/>
            That Quintilian is speaking of the reading of poetry, is apparent from </note> <pb n="71"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            where the sense is concluded, where it begins, when the voice <lb/>
            is to be raised or lowered, what is to be uttered with any par­ <lb/>
            ticular inflexion of sound, or what is to be pronounced with <lb/>
            greater slowness or rapidity, with greater animation or gentle­ <lb/>
            ness than other passages, can be taught only in practice. 2. <lb/>
            There is but one direction, therefore, which I have to give in <lb/>
            this part of my work, namely, that he may be able to do all <lb/>
            this successfully, let him understand what he reads.</p>
          <p>Let his mode of reading, however, be, above all, manly, <lb/>
            uniting gravity with a certain degree of sweetness; and let <lb/>
            not his reading of the poets be like that of prose; for it is <lb/>
            verse, and the poets say that they sing; yet let it not <lb/>
            degenerate into sing-song, or be rendered effeminate with un­ <lb/>
            natural softness, as is now the practice among most readers; <lb/>
            on which sort of reading we hear that Caius Cæsar, while he <lb/>
            was still under age, observed happily to some one that was <lb/>
            practising it, " If you are singing, you sing badly; if you pre­ <lb/>
            tend to read, you nevertheless sing." 3. Nor would I have <lb/>
            prosopopeiæ pronounced, as some would wish them, after the <lb/>
            manner of actors; though I think there should be a certain <lb/>
            alteration of the voice by which they may be distinguished <lb/>
            from those passages in which the poet speaks in his own <lb/>
            person.</p>
          <p>4. Other points * demand much admonition to be given on <lb/>
            them; and care is to be taken, above all things, that tender <lb/>
            minds, which will imbibe deeply whatever has entered them <lb/>
            while rude and ignorant of everything, may learn, not only <lb/>
            what is eloquent, but, still more, what is morally good. 5. <lb/>
            It has accordingly been an excellent custom, that reading <lb/>
            should commence with Homer and Virgil, although, to <lb/>
            understand their merits, there is need of maturer judgment; <lb/>
            but for the acquisition of judgment there is abundance of time; <lb/>
            for they will not be read once only. In the meantime, let the <lb/>
            mind of the pupil be exalted with the sublimity of the heroic <lb/>
            verse, conceive ardour from the magnitude of the subjects, and <note type="footnote"> the next section; and he had previously, i. 4, 2, mentioned in <lb/>

            tragedies is beneficial; the lyric poets nourish the mind, pro­ <lb/>
            vided that you select from them, not merely authors, but <lb/>
            portions of their works; for the Greeks are licentious in <lb/>
            many of their writings, and I should be loath to interpret <lb/>
            Horace in certain passages. As to elegy, at least that which <lb/>
            treats of love, and hendecasyllables, * and poems in which <lb/>
            there are portions of Sotadic verses, (for concerning Sotadic <lb/>
            verses themselves no precept need even be mentioned,) let <lb/>
            them be altogether kept away, if it be possible; if not, let <lb/>
            them at least be reserved for the greater strength of mature <lb/>
            age.‡ 7 Of comedy, which may contribute very much to <lb/>
            eloquence, as it extends to all sorts of characters and passions, <lb/>
            I will state a little further on, in the proper place, the good <lb/>
            which I think it may do to boys; when their morals are out of <lb/>
            danger, it will be among the subjects to be chiefly read. It <lb/>
            is of Menander that I speak, though I would not set aside <lb/>
            other comic writers; for the Latin authors, too, will confer <lb/>
            some benefit. 8. But those writings should be the subjects of <lb/>
            lectures for boys, which may best nourish the mind and <lb/>
            enlarge the thinking powers; for reading other books, which <lb/>
            relate merely to erudition, advanced life will afford sufficient <lb/>
            time.</p>
          <p>The old Latin authors, however, will be of great use, though <lb/>
            most of them, indeed, were stronger in genius than in art. <lb/>
            Above all they will supply a copia verborum; while in their <lb/>
            tragedies may be found a weightiness of thought, and in their <lb/>
            comedies elegance, and something as it were of Atticism. 9. <lb/>
            There will be seen in them, too, a more careful regard to <lb/>
            regularity of structure than in most of the moderns, who have <lb/>
            considered that the merit of every kind of composition lies <lb/>
            solely in the thoughts. Purity, certainly, and, that I may so <lb/>
            express myself, manliness, is to be gained from them; since <lb/>
            we ourselves have fallen into all the vices of refinement, even <lb/>
            in our manner of speaking. 10. Let us, moreover, trust to <lb/>
            the practice of the greatest orators, who have recourse to the <note type="footnote"> * Under this name we understand chiefly Phalæcian verses, such as <lb/>

            poems of the ancients, as well for the support of their argu­ <lb/>
            ments, as for the adornment of their eloquence. 11. For in <lb/>
            Cicero, most of all, and frequently, also, in Asinius, and <lb/>
            others nearest to his times, we see verses of Ennius, Accius, <lb/>
            Pacuvius, Lucilius, Terence, Cæcilius, and other poets, <lb/>
            introduced, with the best effect, not only for showing the learn­ <lb/>
            ing of the speakers, but for giving pleasure to the hearers, <lb/>
            whose ears find in the charms of poetry a relief from the want <lb/>
            of elegance in forensic pleading. 12. To this is to be added <lb/>
            no mean advantage, as the speakers confirm what they have <lb/>
            stated by the sentiments of the poets, as by so many testi­ <lb/>
            monies. But those first observations of mine have reference <lb/>
            rather to boys, the latter to more advanced students,. for the <lb/>
            love of letters, and the benefit of reading, are bounded, not by <lb/>
            the time spent at school, but by the extent of life.</p>
          <p>13. In lecturing on the poets, the grammarian must attend <lb/>
            also to minor points; so that, after taking a verse to pieces, <lb/>
            he may require the parts of speech, to be specified, and the <lb/>
            peculiarities of the feet, which are necessary to be known, not <lb/>
            merely for writing poetry, but even for prose composition ; and <lb/>
            that he may distinguish what words are barbarous, or mis­ <lb/>
            applied, or used contrary to the rules of the language; 14. <lb/>
            not that the poets may thus be disparaged, (to whom, as they <lb/>
            are commonly forced to obey the metre, so much indulgence <lb/>

            above all things, impress upon the minds of his pupils what <lb/>
            merit there is in a just disposition of parts, and a becoming <lb/>
            treatment of subjects; what is well suited to each character; <lb/>
            what is to be commended in the thoughts, and what in the <lb/>

          <p>18. To these duties will be added explanations of historical <lb/>
            points, which must be sufficiently minute, but not carried into <lb/>
            superfluous disquisitions; for it will suffice to lecture on facts <lb/>
            which are generally admitted, or which are at least related by <lb/>
            eminent authors. To examine, indeed, what all writers, even <lb/>
            the most contemptible, have ever related, is a proof either of <lb/>
            extravagant laboriousness. or of useless ostentation, and chains <lb/>
            and overloads the mind, which might give its attention to other <lb/>
            things with more advantage. 19. For he who makes <lb/>
            researches into all sorts of writings, even such as are unworthy <lb/>
            to be read, is capable of giving his time even to old women's <lb/>
            tales. Yet the writings of grammarians are full of noxious <lb/>
            matters of this kind, scarcely known even to the very men who <lb/>
            wrote them. SO. Since it is known to have happened to <lb/>
            Didymus,* than whom no man wrote more books, that, when <lb/>
            he denied a certain story, as unworthy of belief, his own book <lb/>
            containing it was laid before him. 21. This occurs chiefly in <lb/>
            fabulous stories, descending even to what is ridiculous, and <lb/>
            sometimes licentious; whence every unprincipled grammarian <lb/>
            has the liberty of inventing many of his comments, so that he <lb/>
            may lie with safety concerning whole books and authors, as it <lb/>

          <p>Commencement of composition, § 1. Æsop's fables, 2. Sentences, <lb/>
            chriæ, ethologiæ, 8, 4. Narratives from the poets, 5.</p>
          <p>1. Two of the departments, which this profession undertakes, <lb/>
            have now been concluded, namely, the art of speaking cor­ <lb/>
            rectly, and the explanation of authors ; of which they call the <lb/>
            one methodice and the other historice. Let us add, however, <lb/>
            to the business of the grammarian, some rudiments of the art <lb/>
            of speaking, in which they may initiate their pupils while still <lb/>
            too young for the teacher of rhetoric. 2. Let boys learn, then, <lb/>
            to relate orally the fables of Æsop, which follow next after the <lb/>
            nurse's stories, in plain language, not rising at all above <lb/>
            mediocrity, and afterwards to express the same simplicity in <lb/>
            writing. Let them learn, too, to take to pieces the verses of <lb/>
            the poets, and then to express them in different words; and <lb/>
            afterwards to represent them, somewhat boldly, in a paraphrase, <lb/>
            in which it is allowable to abbreviate or embellish certain parts, <lb/>
            provided that the sense of the poet be preserved. 3. He who <lb/>
            shall successfully perform this exercise, which is difficult even <lb/>
            for accomplished professors,* will be able to learn anything. <lb/>
            Let sentences, also, and chriœ, and ethologies,† be written by <note type="footnote"> * I confess that I hesitate at this passage, doubting whether a work <lb/>
            which is difficult even consummatis professoribus, can properly be <lb/>
            imposed upon boys. I am inclined to think, therefore, that those <lb/>
            words must be taken as an ablative rather than a dative, in the sense <lb/>
            of "under the instruction of accomplished professors." Yet such <lb/>
            construction is certainly harsh, and unlike that of Quintilian. <lb/>

            1832. " Of the ethologia," says Spalding, “ we cannot find any such <lb/>
            clear and exact definition." It seems to have been a description of <lb/>
            illustration of the morals or character of a person. </note> <pb n="76"/>

            to the grammarians, because these depend upon reading. The <lb/>
            nature of all these is similar, but their form different; because <lb/>
            a sentence is a general proposition; ethology is confined to <lb/>
            certain persons. 4. Of chrim several sorts are specified: one <lb/>
            similar to a sentence, which is introduced with a simple state­ <lb/>
            ment, He said, or He was accustomed to say: another, which <lb/>
            includes its subject in an answer: He, being asked, or, when <lb/>
            this remark was made to him, replied; a third, not unlike <lb/>
            the second, commences, When some one had, not said, but <lb/>
            done, something 5. Even in the acts of people some think <lb/>
            that there is a chria, as, Crates, having met with an ignorant <lb/>
            boy, beat his tutor: and there is another sort, almost like this, <lb/>
            which, however, the do not venture to call by the same name, <lb/>
            but term it a <foreign xml:lang="grc">χειω̃δες</foreign>; as, ,having been accustomed to <lb/>
            carry the same calf every day ended by carrying a bull. * In <lb/>
            all these forms the declension is conducted through the same <lb/>
            cases, t and a reason may be given as well for acts as for say­ <lb/>
            ings. Stories told bv the poets should. I think, be treated by <lb/>
            boys, not with a view to eloquence but for the purpose of <lb/>
            increasing their knowledge. Other exercises, ofgreater toil <lb/>
            and ardour, the Latin teachers of rhetoric, bv abandoning <lb/>
            them, have rendered the necessary work of teachers of <lb/>
            grammar. The Greek rhetoricians have better unders tood the <lb/>

          <p>1. THESE remarks I have made, as briefly as I could, upon <lb/>
            grammar, not so as to examine and speak of every thing, <lb/>
            which would be an infinite task, but merely of the most <lb/>
            essential points. I shall now add some concise observations <lb/>
            on the other departments of study, in which I think that boys <lb/>
            should be initiated before they are committed to the teacher of <lb/>
            rhetoric, in order that that circle of instruction, which the <lb/>
            Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγϰύϰλιος παιδεία</foreign>, may be completed.</p>
          <p>2. For about the same age the study of other accomplish­ <lb/>
            ments must be commenced; concerning which, as they are <lb/>
            themselves arts, and cannot be complete without the art of <lb/>
            oratory,- but are nevertheless insufficient of themselves to <lb/>
            form an orator, it is made a question whether they are neces­ <lb/>
            sary to this art. 3. Of what service is it, say some people, <lb/>
            for pleading a cause, or pronouncing a legal opinion, to know <lb/>
            how equilateral triangles may be erected upon a given line ? Or <lb/>
            how will he, who has marked the sounds of the lyre by their <note type="footnote"> * Et esse perfectœ sine orandi scientiâ non possunt.] Burmann and <lb/>
            most of the recent editors, have et esse perfecta sine his orandi scientia <lb/>
            non potest, from a conjecture of Regius. Five manuscripts, says Bur­ <lb/>
            mann, omit the non before possunt. But Spalding's reading, which is <lb/>
            that of the majority of the best manuscripts, seems to be right. <lb/>
            Burmann's would set aside all necessity for the following question: <lb/>
            an sint huic operœ necessariœ quœritur: if the art of oratory could not <lb/>
            be perfect without those other arts or sciences, there would be no need <lb/>
            of inquiring whether those arts or sciences were necessary to the art of <lb/>
            oratory. What Quintilian says is, that those arts or sciences cannot <lb/>
            be perfect without the art of oratory, that is, that the art of oratory is <lb/>
            necessary to them, and that it is then to be inquired whether they are <lb/>
            necessary to the art of oratory. Spalding's explanation is, that some <lb/>
            knowledge of language, or the art of oratory, is necessary to the <lb/>
            understanding and teaching of the arts ; mathematics, for instance, <lb/>
            cannot be clearly and efficiently taught or studied without the aid of <lb/>
            correct language. </note> <pb n="78"/>

            names and intervals, defend an accused person, or direct con­ <lb/>
            sultations, the better on that account ? 4. They may perhaps <lb/>
            reckon, also, many speakers, effective in every way in the <lb/>
            forum, who have never attended a geometrician, and who <lb/>
            know nothing of musicians except by the common pleasure of <lb/>
            listening to them. To these observers I answer in the first <lb/>
            place (what Cicero also frequently remarks in his book ad­ <lb/>
            dressed to Brutus*), that it is not such an orator as is or has <lb/>
            been, that is to be formed by us, but that we have conceived <lb/>
            in our mind an idea of the perfect orator, an orator deficient <lb/>
            in no point whatever. 5. For when the philosophers would <lb/>
            form their wise man, who is to be perfect in every respect, <lb/>
            and, as they say, a kind of mortal god, they not only believe <lb/>
            that he should be instructed, in a general knowledge of divine <lb/>
            and human things, but conduct him through a course of <lb/>
            questions which are certainly little, if you consider them <lb/>
            merely in themselves, (as, sometimes, through studied subtleties <lb/>
            of argument,) not because questions about horns † or crocodiles‡ <lb/>
            can form a wise man, but because a wise mail ought never to <lb/>
            be in error even in the least matters. 6. In like manner, it <lb/>
            is not the geometrician, or the musician, or the other studies <lb/>
            which I shall add to theirs, that will make the perfect orator <lb/>
            (who ought to be a wise man), yet these accomplishments will <lb/>
            contribute to his perfection. We see an antidote, for example, <lb/>
            and other medicines to heal diseases and wounds, compounded <lb/>
            of many and sometimes opposite ingredients, from the various <lb/>
            qualities of which results that single compound, which resem­ <lb/>

            may not appear, or put themselves forward, in the course of a <lb/>
            speech, yet contribute to it a secret power, and are silently <lb/>

            which even little shall be wanting, will not be a whole; and <lb/>
            it will be agreed that perfection is a whole, of which though <lb/>
            the hope may be on a distant height as it were, yet it is for us <lb/>
            to suggest every means of attaining it, that something more, at <lb/>
            least, may thus be done. But why should our courage fail <lb/>
            us ? Nature does not forbid the formation of a perfect orator; <lb/>
            and it is disgraceful to despair of what is possible.</p>
          <p>9. For myself, I could be quite satisfied with the judgment <lb/>
            of the ancients; for who is ignorant that music (to speak of <lb/>
            that science first) enjoyed, in the days of antiquity, so much, <lb/>
            not only of cultivation, but of reverence, that those who were <lb/>
            musicians were deemed also prophets and sages, as, not to <lb/>
            mention others, Orpheus and Linus, both of whom are trans <lb/>
            mitted to the memory of posterity as having been descended <lb/>
            from the gods, and the one, because he soothed the rude and <lb/>
            barbarous minds of men by the wonderful effect of his-strains, <lb/>
            as having drawn after him not only wild beasts, but even <lb/>
            rocks and woods. 10. Timagenes* declares that music was <lb/>
            the most ancient of sciences connected with literature; an <lb/>
            opinion to which the most celebrated poets give their support, <lb/>
            according to whom the praises of gods and heroes used to be <lb/>
            sung to the lyre at royal banquets. Does not Virgil's Iopas, <lb/>
            too, sing errantem lunam solisque labores, " the wandering <lb/>
            moon, and labours of the sun;" the illustrious poet thus <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. L </note> <lb/>
            divine things? If this position be granted, music will be <lb/>
            necessary also for the orator; for, as I observed,* this part of <lb/>
            learning, which, after being neglected by orators, has been <lb/>
            taken up by the philosophers, was a portion of our business, <lb/>
            and, without the knowledge of such subjects, there can be no <lb/>
            perfect eloquence.</p>
          <p>12. Nor can any one doubt that men eminently renowned <lb/>
            for wisdom have been cultivators of music, when Pythagoras, <lb/>
            and those who followed him, spread abroad the notion, which <lb/>
            they doubtless received from antiquity, that the world itself <lb/>
            was constructed in conformity with the laws of music, which <lb/>
            the lyre afterwards imitated. 13. Nor were they content, <lb/>
            moreover, with that concord of discordant elements, which <lb/>
            they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμονία</foreign>, "harmony," but attributed even sound to <lb/>
            the celestial motions; for Plato, not only in certain other <lb/>
            passages, but especially in his Timæus, cannot even be under­ <lb/>
            stood except by those who have thoroughly imbibed the <lb/>
            principles of this part of learning. What shall I say, too, of <lb/>
            the philosophers in general, whose founder, Socrates himself, <lb/>
            was not ashamed, even in his old age, to learn to play on the <lb/>
            lyre? 14. It is related that the greatest generals used to <lb/>
            play on the harp and flute, and that the troops of the Laccdæ. <lb/>
            monians were excited with musical notes. What other effect, <lb/>
            indeed, do horns and trumpets produce in our legions, since <lb/>
            the louder is the concert of their sounds, so much greater is <lb/>
            the glory of the Romans than that of other nations in war ? <lb/>
            15. It was not without reason, therefore, that Plato thought <lb/>
            music necessary for a man who would be qualified for engaging <lb/>
            in government, and whom the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτιϰός</foreign>. Even the <lb/>
            chiefs of that sect which appears to some extremely austere, <lb/>
            and to others extremely harsh, were inclined to think that <lb/>
            some of the wise might bestow a portion of their attention on <lb/>
            this study. Lycurgus, also, the maker of most severe laws <lb/>
            for the Lacedaemonians, approved of the study of music. 16. <lb/>
            Nature herself, indeed, seems to have given music to us as a <lb/>
            benefit, to enable us to endure labours with greater facility; <lb/>
            for musical sounds cheer even the rower; and it is not only <lb/>
            in those works, in which the efforts of many, while some <lb/>
            pleasing voice leads them, conspire together, that music is of <lb/>
            avail, but the toil even of people at work by themselves finds <note type="footnote">* Proœm. sect. 14. </note> <pb n="81"/>

            itself soothed by song, however rude.* 17. I appear, however, <lb/>
            to be making a eulogy on this finest of arts, rather than con­ <lb/>
            necting it with the orator. Let us pass lightly over the fact, <lb/>
            then, that grammar and music t were once united; since <lb/>
            Archytas and Aristoxenas, indeed, thought grammar compre­ <lb/>
            hended under music; ‡ and that they themselves were teachers <lb/>
            of both arts, not only Sophron§ shows, (a writer, it is true, only <lb/>
            of mimes, but one whom Plato so highly valued, that he is said <lb/>
            to have had his books under his head when he was dying,) but <lb/>
            also Eupolis, whose Prodamusll teaches both music and gram­ <lb/>
            mar, and Maricas, that is to say, Hyperbolus, confesses that <lb/>
            he knows nothing of music but letters. 18. Aristophanes, <lb/>
            also, in more than one of his comedies,¶ shows that boys were <lb/>
            accustomed to be thus instructed in times of old; and, in the <lb/>
            Hypobolimæus** of Menander, an old man, laying before a <lb/>
            father, who is claiming a son from him, an account as it were <lb/>
            of the expenses that he had bestowed upon his education, says <note type="footnote"> * Verse sweetens toil, however rude the sound; <lb/>

            to use the words of Cicero, " but imperfectly educated." <lb/>
            Among the Romans, likewise, it was usual to introduce lyres <lb/>
            and flutes at feasts. The verses of the Salii also have their <lb/>
            tune; and these customs, as they were all established by <lb/>
            Numa, prove that not even by those, who seem to have been <lb/>
            rude and given to war, was the cultivation of music neglected, <lb/>
            as far as that age admitted it. 21. It passed at length, <lb/>
            indeed, into a proverb among the Gauls, that the uneducated <lb/>
            had no commerce either with the Muses or the Graces.</p>
          <p>22. But let us consider what peculiar advantage he who is <lb/>
            to be an orator may expect from music. Music has two kinds <lb/>
            of measures, the one in the sounds of the voice,* the other in <lb/>
            the motions of the body; for in both a certain due regulation <lb/>
            is required. Aristoxenus the musician divides all that belongs <lb/>
            to the voice into <foreign xml:lang="grc">υθμός</foreign>, " rhythm," and peXo, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμμετον</foreign>, " me­ <lb/>
            lody in measure;" of which the one consists in modulation, <lb/>
            the other in singing and tunes.† Are not all these ‡ qualifi­ <lb/>
            cations, then, necessary to the orator, the one of which relates <lb/>
            to gesture, the second to the collocation of words, and the <lb/>
            third to the inflexions of the voice, which in speaking are <lb/>
            extremely numerous ? 28. Such is undoubtedly the case, <lb/>
            unless we suppose, perchance, that a regular structure and <lb/>
            smooth combination of words is requisite only in poems and <lb/>
            songs, and is superfluous in making a speech; or that com­ <lb/>
            position and modulation! are not to be varied in speaking, as <lb/>
            in music, according to the nature of the subject. 24. Music, <note type="footnote"> * Quintilian is here speaking only with reference to an orator. </note><note type="footnote"> + The one being <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλος ἄμετϱον</foreign>, like that of an Æolian harp, <lb/>

            music in the modulation of the voice. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> § Compositio et sonus.] Spalding hesitates at the word compositio, and <lb/>
            would willingly eject it from the text, not seeing how it differs from <lb/>
            copulatio immediately preceding. Compositio, however, seems to refer <lb/>
            to the due blending of sounds; copulatio tc the junction of words <lb/>
            without reference to their sounds. </note> <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.X.] </note> <lb/>
            however, by means of the tone and modulation of the voice, <lb/>
            expresses sublime thoughts with grandeur, pleasant ones with <lb/>
            sweetness, and -ordinary ones with calmness, and sympathises <lb/>
            in its whole art with the feelings attendant on what is ex­ <lb/>
            pressed. 25. In oratory, accordingly, the raising, lowering, or <lb/>
            other inflexion of the voice, tends to move the feelings of the <lb/>
            hearers; and we try to excite the indignation of the judges in <lb/>
            one modulation of phrase - and voice, (that I may again use <lb/>
            the same term,†) and their pity in another; for we see that <lb/>
            minds are affected in different ways even by musical iustru <lb/>
            ments, though no words cannot be uttered by them.</p>
          <p>26. A graceful and becoming motion of the body, also, <lb/>
            which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐθμία</foreign>, is necessary, and cannot be <lb/>
            sought from any other art than music; a qualification on <lb/>
            which no small part of oratory depends, and for treating on <lb/>
            which a peculiar portion of our work is set apart.‡ If an <lb/>
            orator shall pay extreme attention to his voice, what is so <lb/>
            properly the business of music? But neither is this depart­ <lb/>
            ment of my work to be anticipated; so that we must confine <lb/>
            ourselves, in the mean time, to the single example of Caius <lb/>
            Gracchus, the most eminent orator of his time, behind whom, <lb/>
            when he spoke in public, a musician used to stand, and to give, <lb/>
            with a pitch-pipe, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">τονάιον</foreign>, the tones in <lb/>
            which his voice was to be exerted. 28. To this he attended <lb/>
            even in his most turbulent harangues, both when he frightened <lb/>
            the patricians, and after he began to fear them.</p>
          <p>For the sake of the less learned, and those, as they say, " of <lb/>
            a duller muse," I would wish to remove all doubt of the utility <lb/>
            of music. 29. They will allow, assuredly, that the poets <lb/>
            should be read by him who would be an orator; but are they,§ <lb/>
            then, to be read without a knowledge of music ? If any one <lb/>
            s so blind of intellect, however, as to hesitate about the read­ <lb/>
            ing of other poets, he will doubtless admit that those should <note type="footnote"> * Collocationis.] That is, collocationis verborum, phraseology or style. </note><note type="footnote"> t Whether by " same term " he means voice or modulation it is not <lb/>

            matters I should have to enlarge more fully, if I recommended <lb/>
            this as a new study; but since it has been perpetuated from <lb/>
            the most ancient times, even from those of Chiron and Achilles <lb/>
            to our own, (among all, at least, who have not been averse to a <lb/>
            regular course of mental discipline,) I must not proceed to <lb/>
            make the point doubtful by anxiety to defend it. 31. Though <lb/>
            I consider it sufficiently apparent, however, from the very <lb/>
            examples which I have now given, what music pleases me, <lb/>
            and to what extent, yet I think that I ought to declare more <lb/>
            expressly, that that sort of music is not recommended by me, <lb/>
            which, prevailing at present in the theatres, and being of an <lb/>
            effeminate character, languishing with lascivious notes, has in <lb/>
            a great degree destroyed whatever manliness was left among <lb/>
            us ; but those strains in which the praises of heroes were sung, <lb/>
            and which heroes themselves sung; not the sounds of psal­ <lb/>
            teries and languishing lutes,. which ought to be shunned even <lb/>
            by modest females, but the knowledge of the principles of the <lb/>
            art, which is of the highest efficacy in exciting and allaying the <lb/>
            passions. 32. For Pythagoras, as we have heard, calmed a <lb/>
            party of young men, when urged by their passions to offer <lb/>
            violence to a respectable family, by requesting the female <lb/>
            musician, who was playing to them, to change her strain to a <lb/>
            spondaic measure ;t and Chrysippus assigns a peculiar tune <lb/>
            for the lullaby ‡ of nurses, which is used with children. 33. <lb/>
            There is also a subject for declamation in the schools, not <lb/>
            unartfully invented, in which it is supposed that a flute-player,§ <lb/>
            who had played a Phrygian || tune to a priest while he was sacri­ <note type="footnote"> * Psalteria—spadicas.] He means, if I am not mistaken, instruments <lb/>
            of an extremely effeminate character, rendered so by the extraordinary <lb/>
            number of strings. Spalding. Of the spadix nothing is known but that <lb/>
            it was a stringed instrument, named, probably, from the wood (spadix, <lb/>
            a palm-branch) of which it was made, Pollux iv. 59. Aul. Gell. iii. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> t Which was more grave and solemn. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Allectationi.] We can hardly think this word genuine. Hemster­ <lb/>
            husius conjectured lallationi, from lallare, " to sing lullaby." See <lb/>
            Spalding's notes. </note><note type="footnote"> § Ponitur tribicen—accusari.] Spalding very justly observes that the <lb/>
            construction, and the general usage of the verb pono with reference to <lb/>
            subjects of declamation, require tibicinem ; unless accusari be altered <lb/>
            be accusatus, which would be on the whole a less eligible emendation. </note><note type="footnote"> l| How exciting the Phrygian measure was may be seen in Jam­ <lb/>

            cause of his death; and if such causes have to be pleaded by <lb/>
            an orator, and cannot be pleaded without a knowledge of <lb/>
            music, how can even the most prejudiced forbear to admit that <lb/>
            this art is necessary to our profession ?</p>
          <p>34. As to geometry, people admit that some attention to it is <lb/>
            of advantage in tender years; for they allow that the thinking <lb/>
            powers are excited, and the intellect sharpened by it, and that <lb/>
            a quickness of perception is thence produced; but they fancy <lb/>
            that it is not, like other sciences, profitable after it has been <lb/>
            acquired, but only whilst it is being studied. 35. Such is the <lb/>
            common opinion respecting it. But it is not without reason <lb/>
            that the greatest men have bestowed extreme attention on this <lb/>
            science; for as geometry is divided between numbers and <lb/>
            figures, the knowledge of numbers, assuredly, is necessary not <lb/>
            only to an orator, but to every one who has been initiated even <lb/>
            in the rudiments of learning. In pleading causes, it is very <lb/>
            often in request; when the speaker, if he hesitates, I do not say <lb/>
            about the amount of a calculation, but if he even betray, by <lb/>
            any uncertain or awkward movement of his fingers, a want of <lb/>
            confidence in his calculations, is thought to be but imperfectly <lb/>
            accomplished in his art. 36. The knowledge of linear figures, <lb/>
            too, is frequently required in causes; for law-suits occur con­ <lb/>
            cerning boundaries and measures. But geometry has a still <lb/>
            greater connexion with the art of oratory.</p>
          <p>37. Order, in the first place, is necessary in geometry; and <lb/>
            is it not also necessary in eloquence ? Geometry proves what <lb/>
            follows from what precedes, what is unknown from what is <lb/>
            known; and do we not draw similar conclusions in speaking ? <lb/>
            Does not the well known mode of deduction from a number <lb/>
            of proposed questions consist almost wholly in syllogisms? <lb/>
            Accordingly you may find more persons to say that geometry <lb/>
            is allied to logic, than that it is allied to rhetoric. 38. But <lb/>
            even an orator, though rarely, will yet at times prove logically, <lb/>
            for he will use syllogisms if his subject shall require them, and <lb/>
            will of necessity use the enthymem, which is a rhetorical <lb/>
            syllogism. Besides, of all proofs, the strongest are what are <note type="footnote">sacred ceremonies of the Phrygian or Berecynthian mother. L ician <lb/>
            in his Harmoaides, near the beginning, mentions <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἔνθεον</foreign>, " the <lb/>
            divine fury," of the Phrygian melody. Spalding. </note> <pb n="86"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.I. </note> <lb/>
            called geometrical demonstrations;. and what does oratory <lb/>
            make its object more indisputably than proof ?</p>
          <p>Geometry often, moreover, by demonstration, proves what is <lb/>
            apparently true to be false. This is also done with respect to <lb/>
            numbers, by means of certain figures which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψευδο­ <lb/>
            γαφίαι</foreign>, † and at which we were accustomed to play when we <lb/>
            were boys. But there are other questions of a higher nature. <lb/>
            For who would not believe the asserter of the following pro <lb/>
            position: "Of whatever places the boundary lines measure <lb/>
            the same length, of those places the areas also, which are <lb/>
            contained by those lines, must necessarily be equal?" 40. But <lb/>
            this proposition is fallacious; for it makes a vast difference <lb/>
            what figure the boundary lines may form ; and historians, who <lb/>
            have thought that the dimensions of islands are sufficiently <lb/>
            indicated by the space traversed in sailing round them, have <lb/>
            been justly censured by geometricians.t 41. For the nearer <lb/>
            to perfection any figure is, the greater is its capacity; and if <lb/>
            the boundary line, accordingly, shall form a circle, which of all <lb/>
            plane figures is the most perfect, it will embrace a larger area <lb/>
            than if it shall form a square of equal circumference. Squares, <lb/>
            again, contain more than triangles of equal circuit, and trian­ <lb/>
            gles themselves contain more when their sides are equal than <lb/>
            when they are unequal. 42. Some other examples may per­ <lb/>
            haps be too obscure; let us take an instance most easy of <lb/>
            comprehension even to the ignorant. There is scarcely any <lb/>
            man who does not know that the dimensions of an acre extend <lb/>
            two hundred and forty feet in length, and the half of that <lb/>
            number in breadth; and what its circumference is, and how <lb/>
            much ground it contains, it is easy to calculate. 43. A figure <lb/>
            of a hundred and eighty feet on each side, however, has the <lb/>
            same periphery, but a much larger area contained within its <lb/>
            four sides. If any one thinks it too much trouble to make the <lb/>
            calculation, he may learn the same truth by means of smaller <lb/>
            numbers. Ten feet, on each side of a square, will give forty <lb/>
            for the circumference, and a hundred for the area; but if <note type="footnote"> * Or " linear demonstrations." Compare v. 10, 7. </note><note type="footnote"> t Of these no example is to be found. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ " Of such censure," says Spalding, " I find no instance among the <lb/>
            authors of antiquity, though Pithoeus, in his note on this passage, says <lb/>
            that Polybius and Thucydidcs were blamed on that account by Proclus <lb/>
            in his commentary on Euclid's Elements." He adds that he has <lb/>
            searched in the passages indicated by Pithœus, to no purpose. </note> <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            there were fifteen feet on each side, and five at each end, they <lb/>
            would, with the same circuit, deduct a fourth part from the <lb/>
            area inclosed. 44. If, again, nineteen feet be extended in <lb/>
            parallel lines, only one foot apart, they will contain no more <lb/>
            squares than those along which the parallels shall be drawn; <lb/>
            and yet the periphery will be of the same extent as that which <lb/>
            incloses a hundred. Thus the further you depart from the <lb/>
            form of a square, the greater will be the loss to the area. 45. <lb/>
            It may therefore happen even that a smaller area may be <lb/>
            inclosed by a greater periphery than a larger one.* Such is <lb/>
            the case in plane figures; for on hills, and in valleys, it is <lb/>
            evident even to the untaught that there is more ground than <lb/>
            sky.†</p>
          <p>46. Need I add that geometry raises itself still higher, so as <lb/>
            even to ascertain the system of the world ? When it demon­ <lb/>
            strates, by calculations, the regular and appointed movements <lb/>
            of the celestial bodies, we learn that, in that system, there is <lb/>
            nothing unordained or fortuitous; a branch of knowledge <lb/>
            which may be sometimes of use to the orator. 47. When <lb/>
            Pericles freed the Athenians from fear, at the time that they <lb/>
            were alarmed by an eclipse of the sun, by explaining to them <lb/>
            the causes of the phenomenon; or when Sulpicius Gallus, in <lb/>
            the army of Paulus Æmilius, made a speech on an eclipse of <lb/>
            the moon, that the minds of the soldiers might not be terri­ <lb/>
            fied as by a supernatural prodigy, do they not, respectively, <lb/>
            appear to have discharged the duty of an orator? 48. Had <lb/>
            Nicias been possessed of such knowledge in Sicily, he would <lb/>
            not have been confounded with similar terror, and have given <lb/>
            over to destruction the finest of the Athenian armies ; as Dion, <lb/>
            we know, when he went to overthrow the tyranny of Diony­ <lb/>
            sius, was not deterred by a similar phenomenon. 49. Though <lb/>
            the utility of geometry in war, however, be put out of the <lb/>
            question, though we do not dwell upon the fact that Archime­ <lb/>
            des alone protracted the siege of Syracuse to a great extent, <lb/>
            it is sufficient, assuredly, to establish what I assert, that <lb/>
            numbers of questions, which it is difficult to solve by any other <note type="footnote"> * Thus a right-angled triangle, whose base is 8 feet, perpendicular 6 <lb/>
            feet, and hypotenuse 10 feet, will contain 24 square feet within a <lb/>

          <p>Instruction to be received from the actor, § 1—3. He should <lb/>
            correct faults of pronunciation, 4—8. He should give directions <lb/>
            as to look and gesture, 9—11. Passages from plays should be <lb/>

          <p>1. SOME time is also to be devoted to the actor,† but only <lb/>
            so far as the future orator requires the art of delivery; for I do <lb/>
            not wish the boy, whom I educate for this pursuit, either to be <lb/>
            broken to the shrillness of a woman's voice, or to repeat the <lb/>
            tremulous tones of an old man's. 2. Neither let him imitate <lb/>
            the vices of the drunkard, nor adapt himself to the baseness <lb/>
            of the slave ; nor let him learn to display the feelings of love, <lb/>
            or avarice, or fear; acquirements which are not at all neces­ <lb/>
            sary to the orator, and which corrupt the mind, especially <lb/>
            while it is yet tender and uninformed in early youth; for <lb/>
            frequent imitation settles into habit. It is not even every <lb/>
            gesture or motion that is to be adopted from the actor; for <lb/>
            though the orator ought to regulate both to a certain degree. <lb/>
            yet he will be far from appearing in a theatrical character, and <lb/>
            will exhibit nothing extravagant either in his looks, or the <lb/>
            movements of his hands, or his walk;‡ for if there is any <lb/>
            art used by speakers in these points, the first object of it <lb/>
            should be that it may not appear to be art. <note type="footnote"> * Ch. 21. </note><note type="footnote"> t Comœdo.] Properly a comic actor; but I have thought it sufficient <lb/>

          <p>4. What is then the duty of the teacher as to these particu­ <lb/>
            lars ? Let him, in the first place, correct faults of pronuncia­ <lb/>
            tion, if there be any, so that the words of the learner may be <lb/>
            fully expressed, and that every letter may be uttered with its <lb/>
            proper sound. For we find inconvenience from the two great <lb/>
            weakness or too great fulness of the sound of some letters; <lb/>
            some, as if too harsh for us, we utter but imperfectly, or <lb/>
            change them for others, not altogether dissimilar, but, as it were, <lb/>
            smoother. 5. Thus <foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign> takes the place of , in which even <lb/>
            Demosthenes found difficulty, (the nature of both which letters <lb/>
            is the same also with us,) and when c, and similarly g, are <lb/>
            wanting in full force, they are softened down into t and d.* <lb/>
            6. Those niceties about the letter s,† such a master will not <lb/>
            even tolerate; nor will he allow his pupil's words to sound in <lb/>
            his throat, or to rumble as from emptiness of the mouth ; nor <lb/>
            will he (what is utterly at variance with purity of speaking) <lb/>
            permit him to overlay the simple sound of a word with a fuller <lb/>
            sort of pronunciation, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαταπεπλασμένον</foreign> : <lb/>
            2 term by which the sound of flutes is also designated, when, <lb/>
            after the holes are stopped through which they sound the shrill <lb/>
            notes, they give forth a bass sound through the direct outlet <lb/>
            only.</p>
          <p>8. The teacher will be cautious, likewise, that concluding <lb/>
            syllables be not lost; that his pupil's speech be all of a similar <lb/>
            character; that whenever he has to raise his voice, the effort may <lb/>
            be that of his lungs, and not of his head ; that his gesture may <lb/>
            be suited to his voice, and his looks to his gesture. 9. He will <lb/>
            have to take care, also, that the face of his pupil, while speaking, <lb/>
            look straight forward; that his lips be not distorted; that no <lb/>
            opening of the mouth immoderately distend his jaws; that <note type="footnote"> * As in the imperfect pronunciation of children, who, instead of <lb/>

            pression is ridiculed by Lucian in his <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δίκη φωνηέντων</foreign>. Spalding, </note><note type="footnote"> t I freely confess myself ignorant what those niceties were, as I <lb/>
            have found no passage among the ancients in which they are noticed. <lb/>
            There is a quotation from Ælius Dionysius, however, which Hemster­ <lb/>
            husius ad Lucian. Judic. Vocalium adduces from Eustathius ad IL K. <lb/>
            p. 818 : " Ælius Dionysius says," remarks Eustathius, " that Pericles <lb/>
            was reported to have disliked the configuration of the mouth in pro­ <lb/>
            nouncing the letter sigma, as widening it ungracefully, and to have <lb/>
            exercised himself in uttering it before a looking-glass." By the <lb/>

            his face be not turned up, or his eyes cast down too much, <lb/>
            or his head inclined to either side. 10. The face offends in <lb/>
            various ways; I have seen many speakers, whose eye-brows <lb/>
            were raised at every effort of the voice; those of others I have <lb/>
            seen contracted ; and those of some even disagreeing, as they <lb/>
            turned up one towards the top of the head, while with the <lb/>
            other the eye itself was almost concealed. To all these mat­ <lb/>
            ters, as we shall hereafter show, a vast deal of importance is <lb/>
            to be attached ; for nothing can please which is unbecoming.</p>
          <p>12. The actor will also be required to teach how a narrative <lb/>
            should be delivered ; with what authority persuasion should be <lb/>
            enforced ; with what force anger may show itself: and what <lb/>
            tone of voice is adapted to excite pity. This instruction he will <lb/>
            give with the best effect, if he select particular passages from <lb/>
            plays, such as are most adapted for this object, that is, such as <lb/>
            most resemble pleadings. 13. The repetition of these passages <lb/>
            will not only be most beneficial to pronunciation, but also <lb/>
            highly efficient in fostering eloquence. 14. Such may be the <lb/>
            pupil's studies while immaturity of age will not admit of any­ <lb/>
            thing higher; but, as soon as it shall be proper for him to <lb/>
            read orations, and when he shall be able to perceive their <lb/>
            beauties, then, I would say, let some attentive and skilful tutor <lb/>
            attend him, who may not only form his style by reading, but <lb/>
            oblige him to learn select portions of speeches by heart, <lb/>
            and to deliver them standing, with a loud voice, and exactly as <lb/>
            he will have to plead; so that he may consequently exercise <lb/>
            by pronunciation both his voice and memory.</p>
          <p>15. Nor do I think that those orators are to be blamed who <lb/>
            have devoted some time even to the masters in the palæstra. <lb/>
            I do not speak of those by whom part of life is spent among <lb/>
            oil, and the rest over wine, and who have oppressed the powers <lb/>
            of the mind by excessive attention to the body; (such characters <lb/>
            I should wish to be as far off as possible from the pupil that I <lb/>
            am training;) 16. but the same name* is given to those by <lb/>
            whom gesture and motion are formed; so that the arms may <lb/>
            be properly extended; that the action of the hands may not <lb/>
            be ungraceful or unseemly; that the attitude may not be un­ <lb/>
            becoming ; that there may be no awkwardness in advancing <lb/>
            the feet; and that the head and eyes may not be at variance <note type="footnote"> * That is the name of palœstrici, palœstricis, which precedes, being, <lb/>

            with the turn of the rest of the body. 17. For no one will deny <lb/>
            that all such particulars form a part of delivery, or will sepa­ <lb/>
            rate delivery itself from oratory; and, assuredly, the orator <lb/>
            must not disdain to learn what he must practise, especially <lb/>
            when this chironomia, which is, as is expressed by the word <lb/>
            itself, the law of gesture, had its origin even in the heroic <lb/>
            ages, and was approved by the most eminent men of Greece, <lb/>
            even by Socrates himself; it was also regarded by Plato as a <lb/>
            part of the qualifications of a public man, and was not omitted by <lb/>
            Chrysippus in the directions which he wrote concerning the edu­ <lb/>
            cation of children. 18. The Lacedæmonians, we have heard, <lb/>
            had, among their exercises, a certain kind of dance, as con­ <lb/>
            tributing to qualify men for war. Nor was dancing thought a <lb/>
            disgrace to the ancient Romans; as the dance which continues <lb/>
            to the present day, under the sanction and in the religious rites <lb/>
            of the priests, is a proof; as is also the remark of Crassus <lb/>
            in the third book of Cicero de Oratore, where he recommends <lb/>
            that an orator should adopt a bold and manly action of body, not <lb/>
            learned from the theatre and the player, but from the camp, or <lb/>
            even from the palœstra; the observation of which discipline <lb/>
            has descended without censure even to our time. 19. By me, <lb/>
            however, it will not be continued beyond the years of boyhood, <lb/>
            nor in them long; for I do not wish the gesture of an orator <lb/>
            to be formed to resemble that of a dancer, but I would have <lb/>
            some influence from such juvenile exercises left, so that the <lb/>
            gracefulness communicated to us while we were learning may <lb/>
            secretly attend us when we are not thinking of our move­ <lb/>

          <p>No fear to be entertained lest boys should be engaged in too many <lb/>
            studies, if judgment be used; examples of the number of things <lb/>
            to which the human mind can attend at once, § 1—7. Boys endure <lb/>
            study with spirit and patience, 8—11. Abundance of time for all <lb/>
            necessary acquirements, 12—15. Unreasonable pretexts for not <lb/>
            pursuing study, 16—19.</p>
          <p>1. IT is a common question whether, supposing all these <lb/>
            things are to be learned, they can all be taught and acquired <lb/>
            at the same time; for some deny that this is possible, as the <pb n="92"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B I </note> <lb/>
            mind must be confused and wearied by so many studies of <lb/>
            different tendency for which neither the understanding, nor <lb/>
            the body, nor time itself, can suffice; and even though mature <lb/>
            age may endure such labour, yet that of childhood ought not <lb/>
            to be thus burdened.</p>
          <p>2. But these reasoners do not understand how great the <lb/>
            power of the human mind is; that mind which is so busy and <lb/>
            active, and which directs its attention, so to speak, to every <lb/>
            quarter, so that it cannot even confine itself to do only one thing, <lb/>
            but bestows its force upon several, not merely in the same day, <lb/>
            but at the same moment. 3. Do not players on the harp, for <lb/>
            example, exert their memory, and attend to the sound of their <lb/>
            voice, and the various inflexions of it, while, at the same time, <lb/>
            they strike part of the strings with their right hand, and pull, <lb/>
            stop, or let loose others with their left, while not even <lb/>
            their foot is idle, but beats time to their playing, all these <lb/>
            acts being done simultaneously ? 4. Do not we advocates, when <lb/>
            surprised by a sudden necessity to plead, say one thing while <lb/>
            we are thinking of what is to follow, and while, at the very <lb/>
            same moment, the invention of arguments, the choice of <lb/>
            words, the arrangement of matter, gesture, delivery, look, and <lb/>
            attitude, are necessarily objects of our attention ? If all these <lb/>
            considerations, of so varied a nature, are forced, as by a single <lb/>
            effort, before our mental vision, why may we not divide the <lb/>
            hours of the day among different kinds of study, especially as <lb/>
            variety itself refreshes and recruits the mind, while, on th6 <lb/>
            contrary, nothing is more annoying than to continue at one <lb/>
            uniform labour ? Accordingly writing is relieved by reading, <lb/>
            and the tedium of reading itself is relieved by changes of <lb/>
            subject. 5. However many things we may have done, we <lb/>
            are yet to a certain degree fresh for that which we are going <lb/>
            to begin. Who, on the contrary, would not be stupified, if he <lb/>
            were to listen to the same teacher of any art, whatever it <lb/>
            might be, through the whole day ? But by change a person <lb/>
            will be recruited; as is the case with respect to food, by <lb/>
            varieties of which the stomach is re-invigorated, and is fed <lb/>
            with several sorts less unsatisfactorily than with one. Or let <lb/>
            those objectors tell me what other mode there is of learning. <lb/>
            Ought we to attend to the teacher of grammar only, and then <lb/>
            to the teacher of geometry only, and cease to think, during the <lb/>
            second course, of what we learned in the first? Should we <pb n="93"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII. </note> <lb/>
            then transfer ourselves to the musician, our previous studies <lb/>
            being still allowed to escape us ? Or while we are studying <lb/>
            Latin, ought we to pay no attention to Greek ? Or, to make <lb/>
            an end of my questions at once, ought we to do nothing but <lb/>
            what comes last before us? 7. Why, then, do we not give <lb/>
            similar counsel to husbandmen, that they should not cultivate <lb/>
            at the same time their fields and their vineyards, their olives <lb/>
            and other trees, and that they should not bestow attention at <lb/>
            once on their meadows, their cattle, their gardens, and their <lb/>
            bee-hives? Why do we ourselves devote some portion of our <lb/>
            time to our public business, some to the wants of our friends, <lb/>
            some to our domestic accounts, some to the care of our persons, <lb/>
            and some to our pleasures, any one of which occupations would <lb/>
            weary us, if we pursued it without intermission ? So much <lb/>
            more easy is it to do many things one after the other, than to <lb/>
            do one thing for a long time.</p>
          <p>8. That boys will be unable to bear the fatigue of many <lb/>
            studies, is by no means to be apprehended; for no age suffers <lb/>
            less from fatigue. This may perhaps appear strange; but we <lb/>
            may prove it by experience. 9. For minds, before they are <lb/>
            hardened, are more ready to learn; as is proved by the fact <lb/>
            that children, within two years after they can fairly pronounce <lb/>
            words, speak almost the whole language, though no one incites <lb/>
            them to learn; but for how many years does the Latin tongue <lb/>
            resist the efforts of our purchased slaves! You may well <lb/>
            understand, if you attempt to teach a grown up person to read, <lb/>
            that those who do everything in their own art with excellence, <lb/>
            are not without reason called <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδομαθεῖς</foreign>, that is, " instructed <lb/>
            from boyhood." 10. The temper of boys is better able to bear <lb/>
            labour than that of men ; for, as neither the falls of children, <lb/>
            with which they are so often thrown on the ground, nor their <lb/>
            crawling on hands and knees, nor, soon after, constant play, <lb/>
            and running all day hither and thither, inconvenience their <lb/>
            bodies so much as those of adults, because they are of little <lb/>
            weight, and no burden to themselves, so their minds like­ <lb/>
            wise, I conceive, suffer less from fatigue, because they exert <lb/>
            themselves with less effort, and do not apply to study by <lb/>
            putting any force upon themselves, but merely yield them­ <lb/>
            selves to others to be formed. 11. Moreover, in addition to <lb/>
            the other pliancy of that age, they follow their teachers, as it <lb/>
            were, with greater confidence, and do not set themselves to <pb n="94"/>
            <note type="margin"> |B.L </note> <lb/>
            measure what they have already done. Consideration about <lb/>
            labour* is as yet unknown to them; and, as we ourselves have <lb/>
            frequently experienced, toil has less effect upon the powers <lb/>
            than thought.†</p>
          <p>12. Nor will they ever, indeed, have more disposable time; <lb/>
            because all improvement at this age is from hearing. When <lb/>
            the pupil shall retire by himself to write, when he shall pro­ <lb/>
            duce and compose from his own mind, he will then either not <lb/>
            have leisure, or will want inclination, to commence such <lb/>
            exercises as I have specified. 13. Since the teacher of gram­ <lb/>
            mar, therefore, cannot occupy the whole day, and indeed ought <lb/>
            not to do so, lest he should disgust the mind of his pupil, to <lb/>
            what studies can we better devote his fragmentary intervals. <lb/>
            so to term them, of time ? 14. For I would not wish the <lb/>
            pupil to be worn out in these exercises; nor do I desire that <lb/>
            he should sing, or accompany songs with musical notes, or <lb/>
            descend to the minutest investigations of geometry. Nor <lb/>
            would I make him like an actor in delivery, or like a dancing- <lb/>
            master in gesture; though, if I did require all such qualifica­ <lb/>
            tions, there would still be abundance of time; for the imma­ <lb/>
            ture part of life, which is devoted to learning, is long; and I <lb/>
            am not speaking of slow intellects 15. Why did Plato, let <lb/>
            me ask, excel in all these branches of knowledge which I <lb/>
            think necessary to be acquired by him who would be an <lb/>
            orator? He did so, because, not being satisfied with the <lb/>
            instruction which Athens could afford, or with the science of <lb/>
            the Pythagoreans, to whom he had sailed in Italy, he went <lb/>
            also to the priests of Egypt, and learned their mysteries.</p>
          <p>16. We shroud our own indolence under the pretext of <lb/>
            difficulty; for we have no real love of our work; nor is eloquence <note type="footnote"> * Laboris judicium.] When they are told to execute any task, they <lb/>
            do not reflect, like people of maturer years, and try to form a judgment, <lb/>
            whether it is worth while to do it or not, but set about it at once. 1 <lb/>
            take this to be the sense of the words. The French translator, in <lb/>
            Didot's edition, renders them, " ils ne connaissent pas encore ce que <lb/>
            c'est que le veritable travail." </note><note type="footnote"> t Minus afficit sensus fatigatio quàm cogitatio.] I see that these <lb/>
            words are not understood by some. Cogitatio applies to him who <lb/>
            produces something from his own mind ; fatigatio to him who merely <lb/>
            executes the orders of others, whether by labour of body or of mind. <lb/>
            Spalding. The French translator follows Spalding's interpretation : <lb/>

            CaP ncwe." </note> <pb n="95"/>

            ever sought by us, because it is the most honourable and noble <lb/>
            of attainments, or for its own sake; but we apply ourselves to <lb/>
            labour only with mean views and for sordid gain. 17. Plenty <lb/>
            of orators may speak in the forum, with my permission, and <lb/>
            acquire riches also, without such accomplishments as I recom­ <lb/>
            mend ; only may every trader in contemptible merchandise be <lb/>
            richer than they, and may the public crier make greater profit <lb/>
            by his voice! I would not wish to have even for a reader of <lb/>
            this work a man who would compute what returns his studies <lb/>
            will bring him. 18. But he who shall have conceived, as <lb/>
            with a divine power of imagination, the very idea itself of <lb/>
            genuine oratory, and who shall keep before his eyes true <lb/>
            eloquence, the queen, as an eminent poet calls her, of the <lb/>
            world, and shall seek his gain, not from the pay that he <lb/>
            receives for his pleadings, but from his own mind, and from <lb/>
            contemplation and knowledge, a gain which is enduring and <lb/>
            independent of fortune, will easily prevail upon himself to <lb/>
            devote the time, which others spend at shows, in the Campus <lb/>
            Martius, at dice, or in idle talk, to say nothing of sleep and <lb/>
            the prolongation of banquets, to the studies of geometry and <lb/>
            music; and how much more pleasure will he secure from such <lb/>
            pursuits than from unintellectual gratifications! 19. For <lb/>
            divine providence has granted this favour to mankind, that <lb/>
            the more honourable occupations are also the more pleasing. <lb/>
            But the very pleasure of these reflections has carried me too <lb/>
            far. Let what I have said, therefore, suffice concerning the <lb/>
            studies in which a boy is to be instructed before he enters on <lb/>
            more important occupations; the next book will commence, <lb/>

          <p>Boys are not put under the professor of rhetoric early enough; reasons <lb/>
            why they should begin to receive instruction from him at an <lb/>
            earlier age, § 1—3. The professions of the grammarian and <lb/>
            teacher of rhetoric should be in some degree united, 4—13.</p>
          <p>1. IT has been a prevalent custom (which daily gains <lb/>
            ground more and more) for pupils to be sent to the teachers <lb/>
            of eloquence, to the Latin teachers always, and to the Greeks <lb/>
            sometimes, at a more advanced age than reason requires. Of <lb/>
            this practice there are two causes: that the rhetoricians, <lb/>
            especially our own, have relinquished a part of their duties, <lb/>
            and that the grammarians have appropriated what does not <lb/>
            belong to them. 2. The rhetoricians think it their business <lb/>
            merely to declaim, and to teach the art and practice of <lb/>
            declaiming, confining themselves, too, to deliberative and <lb/>
            judicial subjects,* (for others they despise as beneath their <lb/>
            profession,) while the grammarians, on their part, do not <lb/>
            deem it sufficient to have taken what has been left them, <lb/>
            (on which account also gratitude should be accorded them,) but <lb/>
            encroach even upon prosopopeiæ† and suasory ‡ speeches, <lb/>
            in which even the very greatest efforts of eloquence are dis­ <lb/>
            played. 3. Hence, accordingly, it has happened, that what <lb/>
            was the first business of the one art has become the last of the <lb/>
            other, and that boys of an age to be employed in higher de­ <lb/>
            partments of study remain sunk in the lower school, and <note type="footnote"> * The other department of eloquence, the demonstrative or epidcictic, <lb/>
            which ought to command the attention of rhetoricians, they despise. <lb/>
            Thus in the speeches of Seneca the father, we see only suasoriæ and <lb/>
            Controversiæ, deliberative nnd judicial addresses ; and in the declama­ <lb/>
            tions circulated under the name of Quintilian we find nothing but <lb/>
            mere controversiæ. Spalding. Quintilian would have narratives, or <lb/>
            statements of facts, eulogies, and invectives, to form part of the first <lb/>
            exorcises in rhetoric, as will appear hereafter. Capperonier. </note><note type="footnote"> + By prosopopeiæ we must here understand speeches suited to the <lb/>
            characters of persons by whom they are supposed to have been spoken. <lb/>
            Quintilian speaks of them in b. ii. c. 8. Regius. Such are the <lb/>
            speeches in Livy and other historians. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Suasorias.] Speeches of the kind which they call deliberative, <lb/>
            differing from controversiæ, which is a term properly applied only to <lb/>
            judicial pleadings. Capperonier. The term suasoriæ included both <lb/>
            porsuasory and dissuasoryspeeches. </note> <pb n="97"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH I.] </note> <lb/>
            practise rhetoric under the grammarian. Thus, what is <lb/>
            eminently ridiculous, a youth seems unfit to be sent to a <lb/>
            teacher of declamation until he already knows how to declaim.</p>
          <p>4. Let us assign each of these professions its due limits. <lb/>
            Let grammar, (which, turning it into a Latin word, they have <lb/>
            called literatura, “ literature,") know its own boundaries, <lb/>
            especially as it is so far advanced beyond the humility indicated <lb/>
            by its name, to which humility the early grammarians restricted <lb/>
            themselves; for, though but weak at its source, yet, having <lb/>
            gained strength from the poets and historians,. it now flows <lb/>
            on in a full channel; since, besides the art of speaking cor­ <lb/>
            rectly, which would otherwise be far from a comprehensive art, <lb/>
            it has engrossed the study of almost all the highest depart­ <lb/>
            ments of learning; 5. and let not rhetoric, to which the power <lb/>
            of eloquence has given its name, decline its own duties, or <lb/>
            rejoice that the task belonging to itself is appropriated by <lb/>
            another; for while it neglects its duties, it is almost expelled <lb/>
            from its domain. 6. I would not deny, indeed, that some of <lb/>
            those who profess grammar, may make such progress in know­ <lb/>
            ledge as to be able to teach the principles of oratory; but, <lb/>
            when they do so, they will be discharging the duties of a <lb/>
            rhetorician, and not their own.</p>
          <p>7. We make it also a subject of inquiry, when a boy may <lb/>
            oe considered ripe for learning what rhetoric teaches. In <lb/>
            which inquiry it is not to be considered of what age a boy is, <lb/>
            but what progress he has already made in his studies. That <lb/>
            I may not make a long discussion, I think that the question <lb/>
            when a boy ought to be sent to the teacher of rhetoric, is best <lb/>
            decided by the answer, when he shall be qualified. 8. But <lb/>
            this very point depends upon the preceding subject of con­ <lb/>
            sideration ; for if the office of the grammarian is extended <lb/>
            even to suasory speeches, the necessity for the rhetorician <lb/>
            will come later. If the rhetorician, however, does not shrink <lb/>
            from the earliest duties of his profession, his attention is <lb/>
            required even from the time when the pupil begins narra­ <lb/>
            tions, t and produces his little exercises in praising and <lb/>
            blaming. 9. Do we not know that it was a kind of exercise <lb/>
            among the ancients, suitable for improvement in eloquence, for <note type="footnote"> * Whom the grammarians undertake to explain and illustrate. Cap­ <lb/>

            Have we not to make statements of facts in the forum? I <lb/>
            know not whether that department of rhetoric is not most of <lb/>
            all in request there. 11. Are not eulogy and invective often <lb/>

            its limbs are cast.- Nor let any one blame this haste of mine <lb/>
            (as some will consider it) on the supposition that I think the <lb/>

            which was confounded under one master will be divided; and <lb/>
            each tutor will thus be more efficient in his own province. <lb/>
            This method, to which the Greeks still adhere, has been disre­ <lb/>

            Some additional observations, 14,15.</p>
          <p>1. As soon therefore as a boy shall have attained such pro­ <lb/>
            ficiency in his studies, as to be able to comprehend what we <lb/>
            have called the first precepts of the teachers of rhetoric, he <lb/>
            must be put under the professors of that art.</p>
          <p>2. Of these professors the morals must first be ascertained, <lb/>
            a point of which I proceed to treat in this part of my work, <lb/>
            not because I do not think that the same examination is to be <lb/>
            made, and with the utmost care, in regard also to other teachers, <lb/>
            (as indeed I have shown in the preceding book,‡) but because <lb/>
            the very age of the pupils makes attention to the matter <lb/>
            still more necessary. 3. For boys are consigned to these <lb/>
            professors when almost grown up, and continue their studies <lb/>
            under them even after they are become men ; and greater care <note type="footnote"> * See Aristotle’s Rhetoric, L 16. </note><note type="footnote"> t Namely the grammarians who continue their instruction even after <lb/>

            must in consequence be adopted with regard to them, in order <lb/>
            that the purity of the master may secure their more tendei <lb/>
            years from corruption, and his authority deter their bolder age <lb/>
            from licentiousness. 4. Nor is it enough that he give, in <lb/>
            himself, an example of the strictest morality, unless he regulate, <lb/>
            also, by severity of discipline, the conduct of those who come <lb/>
            to receive his instructions.</p>
          <p>Let him adopt, then, above all things, the feelings of a <lb/>
            parent towards his pupils, and consider that he succeeds to the <lb/>
            place of those by whom the children were entrusted to him. <lb/>
            5. Let him neither have vices in himself, nor tolerate them <lb/>
            in others. Let his austerity not be stern, nor his affability too <lb/>
            easy, lest dislike arise from the one, or contempt from the <lb/>
            other. Let him discourse frequently on what is honourable <lb/>
            and good, for the oftener he admonishes, the more seldom will <lb/>
            he have to chastise. Let him not be of an angry temper, <lb/>
            and yet not a conniver at what ought to be corrected. Let <lb/>
            him be plain in his mode of teaching, and patient of labour, <lb/>
            but rather diligent in exacting tasks than fond of giving them <lb/>
            of excessive length. 6. Let him reply readily to those who put <lb/>
            questions to him, and question of his own accord those who <lb/>
            do not. In commending the exercises of his pupils, let him be <lb/>
            neither niggardly nor lavish ; for the one quality begets dislike <lb/>
            of labour, and the other self-complacency. 7. In amending <lb/>
            what requires correction, let him not be harsh, and, least of all, <lb/>
            not reproachful; for that very circumstance, that some tutors <lb/>
            blame as if they hated, deters many young men from their <lb/>
            proposed course of study. Let him every day say something, <lb/>
            and even much, which, when the pupils hear, they may carry <lb/>
            away with them, for though he may point out to them, in their <lb/>
            course of reading, plenty of examples for their imitation, yet <lb/>
            the living voice, as it is called, feeds the mind more nutritiously, <lb/>
            and especially the voice of the teacher, whom his pupils, if <lb/>
            they are but rightly instructed, both love and reverence. How <lb/>
            much more readily we imitate those whom we like, can scarcely <lb/>
            be expressed.</p>
          <p>9. The liberty of standing up and showing exultation, in <lb/>
            giving applause,. as is done under most teachers, is by no mean. <lb/>
            to be allowed to boys ; for the approbation even of young men, <note type="footnote"> * Not to the master, but to one another, as Spalding observes, and <lb/>
            as appears from what follows. </note> <pb n="101"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            when they listen to others, ought to be but temperate. Hence <lb/>
            it will result that the pupil will depend on the judgment of <lb/>
            the master, and will think that he has expressed properly <lb/>
            whatever shall have been approved by him. 10. But that <lb/>
            most mischievous politeness, as it is now termed, which is shown <lb/>
            by students in their praise of each other's compositions, what­ <lb/>
            ever be their merits, is not only unbecoming and theatrical,* <lb/>
            and foreign to strictly regulated schools, but even a most <lb/>
            destructive enemy to study, for care and toil may well appear <lb/>
            superfluous, when praise is ready for whatever the pupils have <lb/>
            produced. 11. Those therefore who listen, as well as he who <lb/>
            speaks, ought to watch the countenance of the master, for <lb/>
            they will thus discern what is to be approved and what to be <lb/>
            condemned; and thus power will be gained from composition, <lb/>
            and judgment from being heard.†12. But now, eager and <lb/>
            ready, they not only start up at every period, but dart forward, <lb/>
            and cry out with indecorous transports. The compliment is <lb/>
            repaid in kind, and upon such applause depends the fortune of <lb/>
            a declamation ; and hence result vanity and self-conceit, inso­ <lb/>
            much that, being elated with the tumultuous approbation of <lb/>
            their class-fellows, they are inclined, if they receive but little <lb/>
            praise from the master, to form an ill opinion of him. 13. <lb/>
            But let masters, also, desire to be heard themselves with atten­ <lb/>
            tion and modesty; for the master ought not to speak to suit the <lb/>
            taste of his pupils, but the pupils to suit that of the master. <lb/>
            If possible, moreover, his attention should be directed to <lb/>
            observe what each pupil commends in his speeches, and for what <lb/>
            reason; and he may then rejoice that what he says will give <lb/>
            pleasure, not more on his own account than on that of his <lb/>
            pupils who judge with correctness.</p>
          <p>14. That mere boys should sit mixed with young men, I <lb/>
            do not approve ; for though such a man as ought to preside <lb/>
            over their studies and conduct, may keep even the eldest of <lb/>
            his pupils under control, yet the more tender ought to be <lb/>
            separate from the more mature, and they should all be kept <note type="footnote"> * Such as is given by spectators in the theatre; see i. 2, 9. Spalding. <lb/>
            Quintilian appears also to intimate the insincerity of the applause. </note><note type="footnote"> t Sic stilo facultas continget, auditione judicium.] The style meant is <lb/>
            that of the speaker or reciter himself, who brings with him from home <lb/>

            free, not merely from the guilt of licentiousness, but even <lb/>
            from the suspicion of it. 15. This point I thought proper <lb/>
            briefly to notice; that the master and his school should be <lb/>
            clear of gross vice, I do not suppose it necessary to intimate. <lb/>
            And if there is any father who would not shrink from flagrant <lb/>
            vice in choosing a tutor for his son, let him be assured that all <lb/>
            other rules, which I am endeavouring to lay down for the <lb/>
            benefit of youth, are, when this consideration is disregarded, <lb/>
            useless to him.</p>

          <p>A pupil should be put under an eminent teacher at first, not under an <lb/>
            inferior one, § 1—3. Mistakes of parents as to this point, 3, 4. <lb/>
            The best teacher can teach little things best, as well as great ones, <lb/>
            5—9. The pupils of eminent teachers will afford better examples <lb/>
            to each other, 10—12.</p>
          <p>1. NOR is the opinion of those to be passed in silence, who, <lb/>
            even when they think boys fit for the professor of rhetoric, <lb/>
            imagine that he is not at once to be consigned to the most <lb/>
            eminent, but detain him for some time under inferior teachers, <lb/>
            with the notion that moderate ability in a master is not only <lb/>
            better adapted for beginning instruction in art, but easier for <lb/>
            comprehension and imitation, as well as less disdainful of <lb/>
            undertaking the trouble of the elements. 2. On this head I <lb/>
            think no long labour necessary to show how much better it is <lb/>
            to be imbued with the best instructions, and how much diffi­ <lb/>
            culty is attendant on eradicating faults which have once gained <lb/>
            ground, as double duty falls on succeeding masters, and the <lb/>
            task indeed of unteaching is heavier and more important than <lb/>
            that of teaching at first. 3. Accordingly they say that <lb/>
            Timotheus, a famous instructor in playing the flute, was <lb/>
            accustomed to ask as much more pay from those whom <lb/>
            another had taught as from those who presented themselves <lb/>
            to him in a state of ignorance. The mistakes committed in <lb/>
            the matter, however, are two ; one, that people think inferior <lb/>
            teachers sufficient for a time, and, from having an easily <lb/>
            satisfied appetite, are content with their instructions; (such <lb/>
            supineness, though deserving of reprehension, would yet be <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            in some degree endurable, if teachers of that class taught <lb/>
            only worse, and not less;) the other, which is even more <lb/>
            common, that people imagine that those who have attained <lb/>
            eminent qualifications for speaking will not descend to inferior <lb/>
            matters, and that this is sometimes the case because they <lb/>
            disdain to bestow attention on minuter points, and sometimes <lb/>
            because they cannot give instruction in them. 5. For my <lb/>
            part, I do not consider him, who is unwilling to teach little <lb/>
            things,. in the number of preceptors; but I argue that the <lb/>
            ablest teachers can teach little things best, if they will; first, <lb/>
            because it is likely that he who excels others in eloquence, has <lb/>
            gained the most accurate knowledge of the means by which <lb/>
            men attain eloquence; 6. secondly, because method,! which, <lb/>
            with the best qualified instructors, is always plainest, is of <lb/>
            great efficacy in teaching; and lastly, because no man rises to <lb/>
            such a height in greater things that lesser fade entirely from his <lb/>
            view. Unless indeed we believe that though Phidias made a <lb/>
            Jupiter well, another might have wrought, in better style than <lb/>
            he, the accessories to the decoration of the work; or that an <lb/>
            orator may not know how to speak; or that an eminent phy­ <lb/>
            sician may be unable to cure trilling ailments.</p>
          <p>7. Is there not then, it may be asked, a certain height of <lb/>
            eloquence too elevated for the immaturity of boyhood to com­ <lb/>
            prehend it? I readily confess that there is ; but the eloquent <lb/>
            professor must also be a man of sense, not ignorant of teach­ <lb/>
            ing, and lowering himself to the capacity of the learner; as <lb/>
            any fast walker, if he should happen to walk with a child, <lb/>
            would give him his hand, relax his pace, and not go on quicker <lb/>
            than his companion could follow. 8. What shall be said, too, <lb/>
            if it generally happens that instructions given by the most <lb/>
            learned are far more easy to be understood, and more per­ <lb/>
            spicuous than those of others ? For perspicuity is the chief <lb/>
            virtue of eloquence, and the less ability a man has, the more <lb/>
            he tries to raise and swell himself out,‡ as those of short <lb/>
            stature exalt themselves on tip-toe,§ and the weak use most <note type="footnote"> Comp. L 4, 23. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ratio.] Ratio is the same as theoria; opposed to praxis. Spalding. <lb/>

            threats. 9. As to those whose style is inflated, displaying a <lb/>
            vitiated taste, and who are fond of sounding words,. or faulty <lb/>
            from any other mode of vicious affectation, I am convinced <lb/>
            that they labour under the fault, not of strength, but of weak­ <lb/>
            ness, as bodies are swollen, not with health, but with disease, <lb/>
            and as men who have erred from the straight road generally <lb/>
            make stoppages.! Accordingly, the less able a teacher is, the <lb/>
            more obscure will he be.</p>
          <p>10. It has not escaped my memory, that I said in the <lb/>
            preceding book,‡ (when I observed that education in schools <lb/>
            was preferable to that at home,) that pupils commencing their <lb/>
            studies, or but little advanced in them, devote themselves <lb/>
            more readily to imitate their school-fellows than their master, <lb/>
            such imitation being more easy to them. This remark may <lb/>
            be understood by some in such a sense, that the opinion which <lb/>
            I now advocate may appear inconsistent with that which I <lb/>
            advanced before. 11. But such inconsistency will be far <lb/>
            from me; for what I then said is the very best of reasons <lb/>
            why a boy should be consigned to the best possible instructor, <lb/>
            because even the pupils under him, being better taught than <lb/>
            those under inferior masters, will either speak in such a <lb/>
            manner as it may not be objectionable to imitate, or, if they <lb/>
            commit any faults, will be immediately corrected, whereas the <lb/>
            less learned teacher will perhaps praise even what is wrong, <lb/>
            and cause it, by his judgment, to recommend itself to those <note type="footnote"> Johnson in his Life of Gray, who, he says, is " tall by walking on tip- <lb/>

            pupils, putting off for a while the consideration of what is <lb/>
            alone called, in common language, the art of rhetoric; for to <lb/>
            me it appears most eligible to commence with that to which <lb/>
            the pupil has learned something similar under the gram­ <lb/>
            marians.</p>
          <p>2. Since of narrations, (besides that which we use in <lb/>
            pleadings,) we understand that there are three kinds ; the <lb/>
            fable,t which is the subject of tragedies and poems,‡ and <lb/>
            which is remote, not merely from truth, but from the appear­ <lb/>
            ance of truth ;§ the argumentum, which comedies represent, <lb/>
            and which, though false, has a resemblance to truth; || and <lb/>
            the history, in which is contained a relation of facts; and <lb/>
            since we have consigned poetic narratives to the grammarians,¶ <note type="footnote"> * Iliad, ix. 432. </note><note type="footnote"> t Or mythological subject. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ That is epic poems, in which we find much that is at variance, not <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B II </note> <lb/>
            let the historical form the commencement of study under the <lb/>
            rhetorician; a kind of narrative which, as it has more of <lb/>
            truth, has also more of substance. 3. What appears to me <lb/>
            the best method of narrating, I will show when I treat of the <lb/>
            judicial part of pleading.* In the meantime it will suffice to <lb/>
            intimate that it ought not to be dry and jejune, (for what <lb/>
            necessity would there be to bestow so much pains upon study, <lb/>
            if it were thought sufficient to state facts without dress or <lb/>
            decoration ?) nor ought it to be erratic, and wantonly adorned <lb/>
            with far-fetched descriptions, in which many speakers indulge <lb/>
            with an emulation of poetic licence. 4. Both these kinds of <lb/>
            narrative are faulty, yet that which springs from poverty is <lb/>
            worse than that which comes from exuberance.</p>
          <p>From boys perfection of style can neither be required nor <lb/>
            expected ; but the fertile genius, fond of noble efforts, and <lb/>
            conceiving at times a more than reasonable degree of ardour, <lb/>
            is greatly to be preferred. Nor, if there be something or <lb/>
            exuberance in a pupil of that age, would it at all displease me. <lb/>
            I would even have it an object with teachers themselves to <lb/>
            nourish minds that are still tender with more indulgence, and <lb/>
            to allow them to be satiated, as it were, with the milk of <lb/>
            more liberal studies. The body, which mature age may after­ <lb/>
            wards nerve, may for a time be somewhat plumper than seems <lb/>
            desirable. 6. Hence there is hope of strength ;while a <lb/>
            child that has the outline of all his limbs exact commonly <lb/>
            portends weakness in subsequent years. Let that age be <lb/>
            daring, invent much, and delight in what it invents, though <lb/>
            it be often not sufficiently severe and correct. The remedy <lb/>
            for exuberance is easy ;barrenness is incurable by any labour. <lb/>
            7. That temper in boys will afford me little hope in which <lb/>
            mental effort is prematurely restrained by judgment. I like <lb/>
            what is produced to be extremely copious, profuse even beyond <lb/>
            the limits of propriety. Years will greatly reduce super­ <lb/>
            fluity ; judgment will smooth away much of it; something <lb/>
            will be worn off, as it were, by use, if there be but metal <lb/>
            from which something may be hewn and polished off, and <lb/>
            such metal there will be, if we do not make the plate too thin <lb/>
            nt first, so that deep cutting may break it. 8. That I hold <lb/>
            such opinions concerning this age, he will be less likely to <note type="footnote"> * Book iv. o. a. </note> <pb n="107"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.IV.] </note> <lb/>
            wonder who shall have read what Cicero - says: “I wish <lb/>
            fecundity in a young man to give itself full scope."</p>
          <p>Above all, therefore, and especially for boys, a dry master is <lb/>
            to be avoided, not less than a dry soil, void of all moisture, for <lb/>
            plants that are still tender. Under the influence of such a <lb/>
            tutor, they at once become dwarfish, looking as it were <lb/>
            towards the ground, and daring to aspire to nothing above <lb/>
            every day talk. To them, leanness is in place of health, and <lb/>
            weakness instead of judgment; and, while they think it <lb/>
            sufficient to be free from fault, they fall into the fault of <lb/>
            being free from all merit. Let not even maturity itself, <lb/>
            therefore, come too fast; let not the must, while yet in the <lb/>
            vat, become mellow, for so it will bear years, and be improved <lb/>
            by age</p>
          <p>10. Nor is it improper for me, moreover, to offer this ad­ <lb/>
            monition ; that the powers of boys sometimes sink under too <lb/>
            great severity in correction ; for they despond, and grieve, and <lb/>
            at last hate their work, and, what is most prejudicial, while <lb/>
            they fear every thing, they cease to attempt any thing. <lb/>
            11. There is a similar conviction in the minds of the culti­ <lb/>
            vators of trees in the country, who think that the knife must <lb/>
            not be applied to tender shoots, as they appear to shrink from <lb/>
            the steel, and to be unable as yet to bear an incision. 12. A <lb/>
            teacher ought therefore to be as agreeable as possible, that <lb/>
            remedies, which are rough in their own nature, may be <lb/>
            rendered soothing by gentleness of hand; he ought to praise <lb/>
            some parts of his pupils' performances, to tolerate some, and <lb/>
            to alter others, giving his reasons why the alterations are <lb/>
            made; and also to make some passages clearer by adding <lb/>
            something of his own. It will also be of service too at times, <lb/>
            for the master to dictate whole subjects himself, which the <lb/>
            pupil may imitate and admire for the present as his own. <lb/>
            13. But if a boy's composition were so faulty as not to admit <lb/>
            of correction, I have found him benefited whenever I told him <lb/>
            to write on the same subject again, after it had received fresh <lb/>
            treatment from me, observing that “he could do still better," <lb/>
            since study is cheered by nothing more than hope. <lb/>
            14. Different ages, however, are to be corrected in different <lb/>
            ways, and work is to be required and amended according to <lb/>
            the degree of the pupil's abilities. I used to say to boys when <note type="footnote"> * De Orat. ii. 21. </note> <pb n="108"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            fhey attempted any thing extravagant or verbose, that “I was <lb/>
            satisfied with it for the present, but that a time would come <lb/>
            when I should not allow them to produce compositions of such <lb/>
            a character." Thus they were satisfied with their abilities, and <lb/>
            yet not led to form a wrong judgment.</p>
          <p>15. But that I may return to the point from which I <lb/>
            digressed, I should wish narrations to be composed with the <lb/>
            utmost possible care; for as it is of service to boys at an early <lb/>
            age, when their speech is but just commenced, to repeat what <lb/>
            they have heard in order to improve their faculty of speaking; <lb/>
            (let them accordingly be made, and with very good reason, to <lb/>
            go over their story again, and to pursue it from the middle, <lb/>
            either backwards or forwards; but let this be done only while <lb/>
            they are still at the knees of their teacher, and, as they can do <lb/>
            nothing else, are beginning to connect words and things, that <lb/>
            they may thus strengthen their memory;) so, when they shall <lb/>
            have attained the command of pure and correct language, ex­ <lb/>
            temporary garrulity, without waiting for thought, or scarcely <lb/>
            taking time to rise,. is the offspring of mere ostentatious <lb/>
            boastfulness. 16. Hence arises empty exultation in ignorant <lb/>
            parents, and in their children contempt of application, want of <lb/>
            all modesty, a habit of speaking in the worst style, the practice <lb/>
            of all kinds of faults, and, what has often been fatal even to <lb/>
            great proficiency, an arrogant conceit of their own abilities. <lb/>
            17. There will be a proper time for acquiring facility of <lb/>
            speech, nor will that part of my subject be lightly passed over <lb/>
            by me; but in the mean time it will be sufficient if a boy with <lb/>
            all his care, and with the utmost application of which that age <lb/>
            is capable, can write something tolerable. To this practice let <lb/>
            him accustom himself, and make it natural to him. He only <lb/>
            will succeed in attaining the eminence at which we aim, or <lb/>
            the point next below it, who shall learn to speak correctly <lb/>
            before he learns to speak rapidly.</p>
          <p>18. To narrations is added, not without advantage, the task <lb/>
            of refuting and confirming them, which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνασϰαυὴ</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατασϰευή</foreign>.† This may be done, not only with regard to . <note type="footnote"> * Vix surgendi mora.] They scarcely allow themselves time to rise <lb/>

            fabulous subjects, and such as are related in poetry, but with <lb/>
            regard even to records in our own annals; as if it be inquired <lb/>
            whether it is credible that a crow settled upon the head of <lb/>
            Valerius when he was fighting, to annoy the face and eyes of his <lb/>
            Gallic enemy with his beak and wings,. there will be ample <lb/>
            matter for discussion on both sides of the question; 19. as <lb/>
            there will also be concerning the serpent, of which Scipio is <lb/>
            said to have been born,† as well as about the wolf of Romulu8, <lb/>
            and the Egeria of Numa. As to the histories of the Greeks, <lb/>
            there is generally licence in them similar to that of the poets. <lb/>
            Questions are often wont to arise, too, concerning the time or <lb/>
            place at which -a thing is said to have been done ; sometimes <lb/>
            even about a person; as Livy, for instance, is frequently in <lb/>
            doubt, and other historians differ one from another.</p>
          <p>SO. The pupil will then proceed by degrees to higher <lb/>
            efforts, to praise illustrious characters, and censure the im. <lb/>
            moral; an exercise of manifold advantage; for the mind is <lb/>
            thus employed about a multiplicity and variety of matters; <lb/>
            the understanding is formed by the contemplation of good and <lb/>
            evil. Hence is acquired, too, an extensive knowledge of <lb/>
            things in general; and the pupil is soon furnished with <lb/>
            examples, which are of great weight in every kind of causes, <lb/>
            and which he will use as occasion requires. 21. Next succeeds <lb/>
            exercise in comparison, which of two characters is the better or <lb/>
            the worse, which, though it is managed in a similar way, yet <lb/>
            both doubles the topics, and treats not only of the nature, but <lb/>
            of the degrees of virtues and of vices. But on the management <lb/>
            of praise and the contrary, as it is the third part of rhetoric, <lb/>
            I shall give directions in the proper place.‡</p>
          <p>22. Common places, (I speak of those in which, without <lb/>
            specifying persons, it is usual to declaim against vices them­ <lb/>
            selves, as against those of the adulterer, the gamester, the <lb/>
            licentious person,) are of the very nature of speeches on trials <lb/>
            and, if you add the name of an accused party, are real accu­ <lb/>
            sations. These, however, are usually altered from their <lb/>
            treatment as general subjects to something specific, as when <lb/>
            the subject of a declamation is a blind adulterer, a poor <lb/>
            gamester, a licentious old man. 23. Sometimes also they have <note type="footnote"> * Livy, book vii.; Aul. GelL is. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> † Aul.Gell. vii. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡B. iii. a. 7. </note> <pb n="110"/>

            their use in a defence; for we occasionally speak in favour <lb/>
            of luxury or licentiousness ;* and a procurer or parasite is <lb/>
            sometimes defended in such a way, that we advocate, not the <lb/>
            person,† but the vice.</p>
          <p>24. Theses, which are drawn from the comparison of things, <lb/>
            as whether a country or city life is more desirable, and whether <lb/>
            the merit of a lawyer or a soldier is the greater, are eminently <lb/>
            proper and copious subjects for exercise in speaking, and con­ <lb/>
            tribute greatly to improvement, both in the province of persua­ <lb/>
            sion and in discussions on trials. The latter of the two <lb/>
            subjects just mentioned is handled with great copiousness by <lb/>
            Cicero in his pleading for Muræna. 25. Such theses as the <lb/>
            following, whether a man ought to marry, and whether political <lb/>
            offices should be sought, belong almost wholly to the deli­ <lb/>
            berative species, for, if persons be but added, they will be <lb/>
            suasory.‡</p>
          <p>26. My teachers were accustomed to prepare us for conjec­ <lb/>
            tural causes§ by a kind of exercise far from useless, and very <lb/>
            pleasant to us, in which they desired us to investigate and <lb/>
            show why Venus among the Lacedæmonians was represented <lb/>
            armed; || why Cupid was thought to be a boy, and winged, and <lb/>
            armed with arrows and a torch,¶and questions of a similar <lb/>
            nature, in which we endeavoured to ascertain the intention, or <lb/>
            object about which there is so often a question in controver­ <lb/>
            sies. This may be regarded as a sort of chria.**</p>
          <p>27. That such questions as those about witnesses, whether <lb/>
            we ought always to believe them, and concerning arguments, <lb/>
            whether we ought to put any trust in trifling ones, belong to <note type="footnote"> * Gesner observes that Cicero has done something of this kind in his <lb/>

            forensic pleading, is so manifest that some speakers,* not <lb/>
            undistinguished in civil offices, have kept them ready in writ <lb/>
            ing, and have carefully committed them to memory, that, <lb/>
            whenever opportunity should offer, their extemporary speeches <lb/>
            might be decorated with them, as with ornaments fitted into <lb/>
            them. †28. By which practice, (for I cannot delay to express <lb/>
            my judgment on the point,) they appeared to me to confess <lb/>
            great weakness in themselves. For what can such men pro­ <lb/>
            duce appropriate to particular causes, of which the aspect is <lb/>
            perpetually varied and new ? How can they reply to questions <lb/>
            propounded by the opposite party? How can they at once <lb/>
            meet objections, or interrogate a witness, when, even on topics <lb/>
            of the commonest kind, such as are handled in most causes, <lb/>
            they are unable to pursue the most ordinary thoughts in any <lb/>
            words but those which they have long before prepared ? 29. <lb/>
            When they say the same things in various pleadings, their <lb/>
            cold meat, as it were, served up over and over again, must <lb/>
            either create loathing in the speakers themselves, or their <lb/>
            unhappy household furniture, which, as among the ambitious <lb/>
            poor, is worn out by being used for several different purposes, <lb/>
            must, when detected so often by the memory of their hearers, <lb/>
            cause a feeling of shame in them; 30. especially as there is <lb/>
            scarcely any common place so common, which can incorporate <lb/>
            well with any pleading, unless it be bound by some link to <lb/>
            the peculiar question under consideration, and which will not <lb/>
            show ‡ that it is not so much inserted as attached ; 31. either <lb/>
            because it is unlike the rest, or because it is very frequently <lb/>
            borrowed without reason, not because it is wanted, but because <lb/>
            it is ready; as some speakers, for the sake of sentiment, in <lb/>
            trod lice the most verbose common places, whereas it is from <lb/>
            the subject itself that sentiments ought to arise. 32. Such <lb/>
            remarks are ornamental and useful if they spring from the <lb/>
            question, but every remark, however beautiful, unless it tends <lb/>
            to gain the cause, is certainly superfluous, and sometimes <note type="footnote"> * As Hortensius ; see ii. 1, 11. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t Emblematis.] The word signifies anything that is inserted in or <lb/>

            even nox'ous. But this digression has been sufficiently pro <lb/>
            longed.</p>
          <p>33. The praise or censure of laws requires more mature <lb/>
            powers, such as may almost suffice for the very highest efforts. <lb/>
            Whether this exercise partakes more of the nature of delibera­ <lb/>
            tive or controversial oratory, is a point that varies according to <lb/>
            the custom and right of particular nations. Among the <lb/>
            Greeks the proposer of laws was called to plead before the <lb/>
            judge; among the Romans it was customary to recommend or <lb/>
            disparage a law before the public assembly.. In either case, <lb/>
            however, few arguments, and those almost certain,†are <lb/>
            advanced; for there are but three kinds of laws, relating to <lb/>
            sacred, public, or private rights. 34. This division has regard <lb/>
            chiefly to the commendation of a law,‡as when the speaker <lb/>
            extols it by a kind of gradation, because it is a law, because it <lb/>
            is public, because it is made to promote the worship of the gods. <lb/>
            35. Points about which questions usually arise, are common to <lb/>
            all laws; § for a doubt may be started, either concerning the <lb/>
            right of him who proposes the law, (as concerning that of <lb/>
            Publius Clodius who was accused of not having been properly <lb/>
            created tribune,||) or concerning the validity of the proposal <lb/>
            itself, a doubt which may refer to a variety of matters, as for <note type="footnote"> * Certain judges were appointed by the assembly of the people <lb/>

            which the new one would abrogate. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t Fere certa.] In opposition to the particulars to which he alludes in <lb/>

            ments advanced in favour or condemnation of a law are generally such <lb/>
            as can have but one tendency, that is, to prove the law to be either <lb/>
            extremely good or extremely bad; they are very seldom such as can <lb/>
            be turned to advantage on either side of the question. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ It is only however the old law that can be thus praised; for the <lb/>

            the mere form and mode of proposing or bringing forward a law; for <lb/>

            proposed, or to be proposed, on an improper day, or contrary <lb/>

            into these early exercises, which are without any allusion to <lb/>
            persons, times, or particular causes. Other points, whether <lb/>
            treated in real or fictitious discussions, are much the same; <lb/>
            for the fault of any law must be either in words or in matter. <lb/>
            37. As to words, it is questioned whether they be sufficiently <lb/>
            expressive ; or whether there is any ambiguity in them ; as to <lb/>
            matter, whether the law is consistent with itself; whether it <lb/>
            ought to have reference to past time, or to individuals. But <lb/>
            the most common inquiry is, whether it be proper or expedient. <lb/>
            38. Nor am I ignorant that of this inquiry many divisions <lb/>
            are made by most professors ; but 1, under the term proper, <lb/>
            include consistency with justice, piety, religion, and other <lb/>
            similar virtues. The consideration of justice, however, is <lb/>
            usually discussed with reference to more than one point; for <lb/>
            a question may either be raised about the subject of the <lb/>
            law, as whether it be deserving of punishment or reward, or <lb/>
            about the measure of reward or punishment, to which an objec­ <lb/>
            tion may be taken as well for being too great as too little. 39. <lb/>
            Expediency, also, is sometimes determined by the nature of <lb/>
            the measure, sometimes by the circumstances of the time. <lb/>
            As to some laws, it becomes a question, whether they can be <lb/>
            enforced. Nor ought students to be ignorant that laws are <lb/>
            sometimes censured wholly, sometimes partly, as examples of <lb/>
            both are afforded us in highly celebrated orations. 40. Nor <lb/>
            does it escape my recollection that there are laws which are <lb/>
            not proposed for perpetuity, but with regard to temporary <lb/>
            honours or commands, such as the Manilian law, about which <lb/>
            there is an oration of Cicero. But concerning these no direc­ <lb/>
            tions can be given in this place; for they depend upon the <lb/>
            peculiar nature of the subjects on which the discussion is <lb/>
            raised, and not on any general consideration.</p>
          <p>41. On such subjects did the ancients, for the most part, <lb/>
            exercise the faculty of eloquence, borrowing their mode of <lb/>
            argument, however, from the logicians. To speak on fictitious <lb/>
            cases, in imitation of pleadings in the forum or in public coun- <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="margin"> [<unclear/>. </note> <lb/>
            cils, is generally allowed to have become a practice among <lb/>
            the Greeks, about the time of Demetrius Phalereus. 42. <lb/>
            Whether that sort of exercise was invented by him, I (as I <lb/>
            have acknowledged also in another book*) have not succeeded <lb/>
            in discovering; nor do those who affirm most positively that he <lb/>
            did invent it, rest their opinion on any writer of good au­ <lb/>
            thority; but that the Latin teachers of eloquence commenced <lb/>
            this practice towards the end of the life of Lucius Crassus, <lb/>
            Cicerot tells us; of which teachers the most eminent w as <lb/>

          <p>Advantages of reading history and speeches, § 1—3. On what points <lb/>
            in them the professor of rhetoric should lecture, 4—9. Faulty <lb/>
            composition may sometimes be read, to exercise the pupil's judg­ <lb/>
            ment, 10—13. Usefulness of this exercise, 14—17. Best authors <lb/>
            to be read at an early age, 18—20. The pupil should be cautious <lb/>
            of imitating very ancient or very modem writers, 21—26.</p>
          <p>1. BUT of the proper mode of declaiming I shall speak a <lb/>
            little further on; in the mean while, as we are treating of the <lb/>
            first rudiments of rhetoric, I should not omit, I think, to <lb/>
            observe how much the professor would contribute to the <lb/>
            advancement of his pupils, if, as the explanation of the poets <lb/>
            is required from teachers of grammar, so he, in like manner, <lb/>
            would exercise the pupils under his care in the reading of <lb/>
            history, and even still more in that of speeches; a practice <lb/>
            which I myself have adopted in the case of a few pupils, whose <lb/>
            age required it,‡ and whose parents thought it would be ser­ <lb/>
            viceable to them. 2. But though I then deemed it an ex­ <lb/>
            cellent method, two circumstances were obstructions to the <note type="footnote"> * If that acknowledgment was made in the book De Causis Corrupta <lb/>

            practice of it; that long custom had established a different <lb/>
            mode of teaching and that they were mostly full-grown youths, <lb/>
            who did not require that exercise, that were forming them­ <lb/>
            selves on my model. 3. But though I should make a new <lb/>
            discovery ever so late, I should not be ashamed to recommend <lb/>
            it for the future. I know, however, that this is now done <lb/>
            among the Greeks, but chiefly by assistant-masters, since the <lb/>
            time would seem hardly sufficient, if the professors were <lb/>
            always to lecture to each pupil as he read. 3. Such lecturing, <lb/>
            indeed, as is given, that boys may follow the writing of an <lb/>
            author easily and distinctly with their eyes, and such even as <lb/>
            explains the meaning of every word, at all uncommon, that <lb/>
            occurs, is to be regarded as far below the profession of a <lb/>
            teacher of rhetoric.</p>
          <p>5. But to point out the beauties of authors, and, if occasion <lb/>
            ever present itself, their faults, is eminently consistent with <lb/>
            that profession and engagement, by which he offers himself to <lb/>
            the public as a master of eloquence, especially as I do not <lb/>
            require such toil from teachers, that they should call their <lb/>
            pupils to their lap, and labour at the reading of whatever book <lb/>
            each of them may fancy. 6. For to me it seems easier, as <lb/>
            well as far more advantageous, that the master, after calling <lb/>
            for silence, should appoint some one pupil to read, (and it will <lb/>
            be best that this duty should be imposed on them by turns,) <lb/>
            that they may thus accustom themselves to clear pronuncia­ <lb/>
            tion ; 7. and then, after explaining the cause for which the <lb/>
            oration was composed, (for so that which is said will be better <lb/>
            understood,) that he should leave nothing unnoticed which is <lb/>
            important to be remarked, either in the thought or the lan­ <lb/>
            guage ; that he should observe what method is adopted in the <lb/>
            exordium for conciliating the judge; what clearness, brevity, <lb/>
            and apparent sincerity, is displayed in the statement of facts; <lb/>
            what design there is in certain passages, and what well con­ <lb/>
            cealed artifice ; (for that is the only true art in pleading which <lb/>
            cannot be perceived except by a skilful pleader;) 8. what <lb/>
            judgment appears in the division of the matter; how subtle <lb/>
            and urgent is the argumentation; with what force the speaker <lb/>
            excites, with what amenity he soothes: what severity is shown <lb/>
            in his invectives, what urbanity in his jests; how he com­ <lb/>
            mands the feelings, forces a way into the understanding, and <lb/>
            makes the opinions of the judges coincide with what he <note type="footnote"> I a </note> <pb n="116"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.II </note> <lb/>
            asserts. 9. In regard to the style, toe, he should notice any <lb/>
            expression that is peculiarly appropriate, elegant, or sublime; <lb/>
            when the amplification deserves praise; what quality is op­ <lb/>
            posed to it, what phrases are happily metaphorical, what <lb/>
            figures of speech are used, what part of the composition is <lb/>
            smooth and polished, and yet manly and vigorous.</p>
          <p>10. Nor is it without advantage, indeed, that inelegant and <lb/>
            faulty speeches, yet such as many, from depravity of taste, <lb/>
            would admire, should be read before boys, and that it should <lb/>
            be shown how many expressions in them are inappropriate <lb/>
            obscure, tumid, low, mean, affected, or effeminate; expressions <lb/>
            which, however, are not only extolled by many readers, but, <lb/>
            what is worse, are extolled for the very reason that they are <lb/>
            vicious, 11. for straight-forward language, naturally expressed, <lb/>
            seems to some of us to have nothing of genius; but whatever <lb/>
            departs, in any way, from the common course, we admire as <lb/>
            something exquisite; as, with some persons, more regard i. <lb/>
            shown for figures that are distorted, and in any respect <lb/>
            monstrous, than for such as have lost none of the advantages <lb/>
            of ordinary conformation. 12. Some, too, who are attracted <lb/>
            by appearance, think that there is more beauty in men who <lb/>
            are depilated and smooth, who dress their locks, hot from the <lb/>
            curling-irons, with pins, and who are radiant with a com­ <lb/>
            plexion not their own, than unsophisticated nature can give; <lb/>
            as if beauty of person could be thought to spring from cor­ <lb/>
            ruption of manners.</p>
          <p>13. Nor will the preceptor be under the obligation merely <lb/>
            to teach these things, but frequently to ask questions upon <lb/>
            them, and try the judgment of his pupils. Thus carelessness <lb/>
            will not come upon them while they listen, nor will the instruc <lb/>
            lions that shall be given fail to enter their ears ; and they <lb/>
            will at the same time be conducted to the end which is sought <lb/>
            in this exercise, namely that they themselves may conceive <lb/>
            and understand. For what object have we in teaching them, <lb/>
            but that they may not always require to be taught ?</p>
          <p>14. I will venture to say that this sort of diligent exercise <lb/>
            will contribute more to the improvement of students than all <lb/>
            the treatises of all the rhetoricians that ever wrote; which <lb/>
            doubtless, however, are of considerable use, but their scope is <lb/>
            more general; and how indeed can they go into all kinds of <lb/>
            questions that arise almost every day? 15. So, though <pb n="117"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V .] </note> <lb/>
            certain general precepts are given in the military art, it wit <lb/>
            yet be of far more advantage to know what plan any leader <lb/>
            has adopted wisely or imprudently, and in what place or at <lb/>
            what time; for in almost every art precepts are of much less <lb/>
            avail than practical experiments. 16. Shall a teacher declaim <lb/>
            that he may be a model to his hearers, and will not Cicero <lb/>
            and Demosthenes, if read, profit them more ? Shall a pupil <lb/>
            if he commits faults in declaiming, be corrected before the <lb/>
            rest, and will it not be more serviceable to him to correct the <lb/>
            speech of another? Indisputably; and even more agreeable ; <lb/>
            for every one prefers that others' faults should be blamed <lb/>
            rather than his own. 17. Nor are there wanting more argu­ <lb/>
            ments for me to offer; but the advantage of this plan can <lb/>
            escape the observation of no one ; and I wish that there mas <lb/>
            not be so much unwillingness to adopt it as there will be <lb/>
            pleasure in having adopted it..</p>
          <p>18. If this method be followed there will remain a question <lb/>
            not very difficult to answer, which is, what authors ought to <lb/>
            be read by beginners? Some have recommended inferior <lb/>
            writers, as they thought them easier of comprehension ; others <lb/>
            have advocated the more florid kind of writers, as being better <lb/>
            adapted to nourish the minds of the young. 19. For my <lb/>
            part, I would have the best authors commenced at once, and <lb/>
            read always; but I would choose the clearest in style, and <lb/>
            most intelligible; recommending Livy, for instance, to be <lb/>
            read by boys rather than Sallust, who, however, is the greater <lb/>
            historian,! but to understand him there is need of some pro <lb/>
            ficiency. SO. Cicero, as it seems to me, is agreeable even to <lb/>
            beginners, and sufficiently intelligible, and may not only profit, <lb/>
            out even be loved; and next to Cicero, (as Livy ‡ advises,) <lb/>
            such authors as most resemble Cicero.</p>
          <p>21. There are two points in style on which I think that the <lb/>
            greatest caution should be used in respect to boys: one is <note type="footnote"> * Gesner very judiciously observes that fecisse should be inserted in <lb/>
            the text between quàm and non displicebit. </note><note type="footnote"> t There has been much discussion among critics as to whether hie <lb/>
            in hic historiæ major est auctor is to be referred to Sallust or Livy ; but <lb/>
            that it ought to be referred to Sallust, will not be doubted, as <lb/>
            Spalding observes, by any one who refers to Martial, xiv. 191; Veil. <lb/>
            Pat. ii. 36; Tacit. Ann. iii. 30 ; Sen. Rhet p. 274. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Quintilian repeats this advice of Livy in x. 1, 39, where he says <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.II </note> <lb/>
            that no master, from being too much an admirer of antiquity, <lb/>
            should allow them to harden, as it were, in the reading of the <lb/>
            Gracchi, Cato* and other like authors ; for they would thus <lb/>
            become uncouth and dry : since they cannot, as yet, under­ <lb/>
            stand their force of thought, and, content with adopting their <lb/>
            style, which, at the time it was written, was doubtless ex <lb/>
            cellent, but is quite unsuitable to our day, they will appear to <lb/>
            themselves to resemble those eminent men. 22. The other <lb/>
            point, which is the opposite of the former, is, lest, being <lb/>
            captivated with the flowers of modern affectation, they should <lb/>
            be so seduced by a corrupt kind of pleasure, as to love that <lb/>
            luscious manner of writing which is the more agreeable to the <lb/>
            minds of youth in proportion as it has more affinity with <lb/>
            fhem. 23. When their taste is formed, however, and out of <lb/>
            danger of being corrupted, I should recommend them to read <lb/>
            not only the ancients, (from whom if a solid and manly force <lb/>
            of thought be adopted, while the rust of a rude age is cleared <lb/>
            off, our present style will receive additional grace,) but also <lb/>
            the writers of the present day, in whom there is much merit. <lb/>
            24. For nature has not condemned us to stupidity, but we <lb/>
            ourselves have changed our mode of speaking, and have <lb/>
            indulged our fancies more than we ought; and thus the <lb/>
            ancients did not excel us so much in genius as in severity or <lb/>
            manner. It will be possible, therefore, to select from the <lb/>
            moderns many qualities for imitation, but care must be taken <lb/>
            that they be not contaminated with other qualities with which <lb/>
            they are mixed. Yet that there have been recently, and are <lb/>
            now, many writers whom we may imitate entirely, I would not <lb/>
            only allow, (for why should I not ?) but even affirm. 26. But <lb/>
            who they are it is not for everybody to decide. We may even <lb/>
            err with greater safety in regard to the ancients: and I would <lb/>
            therefore defer the reading of the moderns, that imitation may <lb/>
            not go before judgment. <note type="footnote"> * The speeches of the Gracchi are lost. Of the many bocks that <lb/>

          <p>In composition, the pupil should have but moderate assistanoe, not too <lb/>
            much or too little.</p>
          <p>1. THERE has been also a diversity of practice among <lb/>
            teachers in the following respect. Some of them, not con­ <lb/>
            fining themselves to giving directions as to the division of any <lb/>
            subject which they assigned their pupils for declamation, <lb/>
            developed it more fully by speaking on it themselves, and <lb/>
            amplified it not only with proofs but with appeals to the <lb/>
            feelings. 2. Others, giving merely the first outlines, ex­ <lb/>
            patiated after the declamations were composed, on whatever <lb/>
            points each pupil had omitted, and polished some passages <lb/>
            with no less care than they would have used if they had them­ <lb/>
            selves been rising to speak in public.</p>
          <p>Both methods are beneficial; and, therefore, for my own <lb/>
            part, I give no distinction to either of them above the other; <lb/>
            but, if it should be necessary to follow only one of the two, <lb/>
            it will be of greater service to point out the right way at first, <lb/>
            than to recall those who have gone astray from their errors; <lb/>
            a. first, because to the subsequent emendation they merely <lb/>
            listen, but the preliminary division they carry to their medita­ <lb/>
            tion and their composition ; and, secondly, because they more <lb/>
            willingly attend to one who gives directions than to one who <lb/>
            finds faults. Whatever pupils, too, are of a high spirit,- are <lb/>
            apt, especially in the present state of manners, to be angry at <lb/>
            admonition, and offer silent resistance to it. 4. Not that <lb/>
            faults are therefore to be less openly corrected; for regard is <lb/>
            to be had to the other pupils, who will think that whatever the <lb/>
            master has not amended is right. But both methods should <lb/>
            be united, and used as occasion may require. To beginners <lb/>
            should be given matter designed,! as it were, beforehand, in <lb/>
            proportion to the abilities of each. But when they shall <lb/>

            6. It is proper that they should sometimes be left to them <lb/>
            selves, lest, from the bad habit of being always led by the <lb/>
            efforts of others, they should lose all capacity of attempting <lb/>
            and producing anything for themselves. But when they seem <lb/>
            to judge pretty accurately of what ought to be said, the labour <lb/>
            of the teacher is almost at an end; though, should they still <lb/>
            commit errors, they must be again put under a guide. <lb/>
            7. Something of this kind we see birds practise, which divide <lb/>
            food, collected in their beaks, among their tender and helpless <lb/>
            young ones; but, when they seem sufficiently grown, teach <lb/>
            them, by degrees, to venture out of the nest, and flutter <lb/>
            round their place of abode, themselves leading the way ; and <lb/>
            at last leave their strength, when properly tried, to the open <lb/>
            sky and their own self-confidence.* <note type="footnote"> * Valerius Flaccus, vii. 375: <lb/>
            Qualis adhuc teneros supremum pallida foetus <lb/>
            Mater ab excelso produxit in aëra nido, <lb/>
            Hortaturque sequi, brevibusque insurgere pennis ; <lb/>
            Illos ccerulei primus ferit horror Olympi ; <lb/>
            J am que redire rogant, adsuetaque quæritur arbor. <lb/>
            As when the anxious dam her tender young <lb/>
            Leads from their lofty nest to loftier skies, <lb/>
            Bidding them follow her, and rise upborne <lb/>
            On half-grown wings; the blue expanse, first tried, <lb/>
            Strikes them with dread ; they, fluttering, chirp for leave <lb/>
            Back to return, and seek th' accustom'd tree. <lb/>
            Of which lines the germ, as Burmann remarks, is found in Ovid, <lb/>
            Met. vili. 213 : <lb/>

            Quæ teneram prolem produxit in aëra nido, <lb/>
            Hortaturque sequi. <lb/>
            The simile is very happily adopted by Goldsmith : <lb/>
            And as a bird each fond endearment tries, <lb/>
            To lure her new-Hedged offspring to the skies. </note> <pb n="121"/>

          <p>Pupils should not always declaim their own compositions, but some­ <lb/>
            times passages from eminent writers,</p>
          <p>1. ONE change, I think, should certainly be made in what <lb/>
            is customary with regard to the age of which we are speaking. <lb/>
            Pupils should not be obliged to learn by heart what they have <lb/>
            composed, and to repeat it, as is usual, on a certain day, a <lb/>
            task which it is fathers that principally exact, thinking that <lb/>
            their children then only study when they repeat frequent <lb/>
            declamations; whereas proficiency depends chiefly on the dili­ <lb/>
            gent cultivation of style. 2. For though 1 would wish boys <lb/>
            to compose, and to spend much time in that employment, yet, <lb/>
            as to learning by heart, I would rather recommend for that <lb/>
            purpose select passages from orations or histories, or any other <lb/>
            sort of writings deserving of such attention. 3. The memory <lb/>
            will thus be more efficiently exercised in mastering what is <lb/>
            another's than what is their own; and those who shall have <lb/>
            been practised in this more difficult kind of labour, will fix in <lb/>
            their minds, without trouble, what they themselves have <lb/>
            composed, as being more familiar* to them ; they will also <lb/>
            accustom themselves to the best compositions, and they will <lb/>
            always have in their memory something which they may <lb/>
            imitate, and will, even without being aware, re-produce that <lb/>
            fashion of style which they have deeply impressed upon their <lb/>
            minds. 4. They will have at command, moreover, an abun­ <lb/>
            dance of the best words, phrases, and figures, not sought for <lb/>
            the occasion, but offering themselves spontaneously, as it <lb/>
            were, from a store treasured within them. To this is added <lb/>
            the power of quoting the happy expressions of any author, <lb/>
            which is agreeable in common conversation, and useful in <lb/>
            pleading; for phrases which are not coined for the sake of the <lb/>
            cause in hand have the greater weight, and often gain us <lb/>
            more applause than if they were our own.</p>
          <p>5. Yet pupils should sometimes be permitted to recite what <lb/>
            they themselves have written, that they may reap the full <lb/>
            reward of their labour from that kind of applause which is most <note type="footnote"> * Spalding retains familiarius in his text, but has no doubt that <lb/>

          <p>Variety of talent and disposition in pupils requires variety of treat­ <lb/>
            ment, § 1—5. How far an inclination for any particular line of <lb/>
            study should be encouraged and cultivated, 6—15.</p>
          <p>1. IT is generally, and not without reason, regarded as an <lb/>
            excellent quality in a master to observe accurately the differ­ <lb/>
            ences of ability in those whom he has undertaken to instruct, <lb/>
            and to ascertain in what direction the nature of each particu­ <lb/>
            larly inclines him; for there is in talent an incredible variety; <lb/>
            nor are the forms of the mind fewer than those of the body. <lb/>
            2. This may be understood even from orators themselves, who <lb/>
            differ so much from each other in their style of speaking, that <lb/>
            no one is like another, though most of them have set them­ <lb/>
            selves to imitate those whom they admired. 3. It has also <lb/>
            been thought advantageous by most teachers to instruct each <lb/>
            pupil in such a manner as to cherish by learning the good <lb/>
            qualities inherited from nature, so that the powers may be <lb/>
            assisted in their progress towards the object to which they <lb/>
            chiefly direct themselves. As a master of palæstric exercises, <lb/>
            when he enters a gymnasium full of boys, is able, after trying <lb/>
            their strength and comprehension in every possible way, to <lb/>
            decide for what kind of exercise each ought to be trained ; <lb/>
            4. so a teacherf of eloquence, they say, when he has clearly <lb/>
            observed which boy's genius delights most in a concise and <note type="footnote"> * That is, the applause of their fellow students. If they merely <lb/>
            wrote, and did not recite, they would gain, as Spalding observes, the <lb/>
            commendation of the master only. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ita præceptorem.] The accusative depends on something under­ <lb/>

            polished manner of speaking, and which in a spirited, or <lb/>
            grave, or smooth, or rough, or brilliant, or elegant one, will so <lb/>
            accommodate his instructions to each, that he will be advanced <lb/>
            in that department in which he shows most ability; 5. because <lb/>
            nature attains far greater power when seconded by culture; <lb/>
            and he that is led contrary to nature, cannot make due pro­ <lb/>
            gress in the studies for which he is unfit, and makes those <lb/>
            talents, for the exercise of which he seemed born, weaker by <lb/>
            neglecting to cultivate them.</p>
          <p>6. This opinion seems to me (for to him that follows reason <lb/>
            there is free exercise of judgment even in opposition to <lb/>
            received persuasions) just only in part. To distinguish pecu­ <lb/>
            liarities of talent is absolutely necessary ; and to make choice <lb/>
            of particular studies to suit them, is what no man would dis­ <lb/>
            countenance. 7. For one youth will be fitter for the study of <lb/>
            history than another; one will be qualified for writing poetry, <lb/>
            another for the study of law, and some perhaps fit only to be <lb/>
            sent into the fields. The teacher of rhetoric will decide in <lb/>
            accordance with these peculiarities, just as the master of the <lb/>
            palæstra will make one of his pupils a runner, another a boxer, <lb/>
            another a wrestler, or fit him for any other of the exercises that <lb/>
            are practised at the sacred games.</p>
          <p>8. But he who is destined for public speaking must strive <lb/>
            to excel, not merely in one accomplishment, but in all the <lb/>
            accomplishments that are requisite for that art, even though <lb/>
            some of them may seem too difficult for him when he is learn­ <lb/>
            ing them; for instruction would be altogether superfluous if <lb/>
            the natural state of the mind were sufficient. 9. If a pupil <lb/>
            that is vitiated in taste, and turgid in his style, as many are, <lb/>
            is put under our care, shall we allow him to go on in his own <lb/>
            way ? Him that is dry and jejune in his manner, shall we not <lb/>
            nourish, and, as it were, clothe? For if it be necessary to <lb/>
            prune something away from certain pupils, why should it not <lb/>
            be allowable to add something to others ? 10. Yet I would not <lb/>
            fight against nature ; for I do not think that any good quality, <lb/>
            which is innate, should be detracted, but that whatever is <lb/>
            inactive or deficient should be invigorated or supplied. Was <lb/>
            that famous teacher Isocrates, whose writings are not stronger <lb/>
            proofs that he spoke well, than his scholars that he taught well, <lb/>
            inclined, when he formed such an opinion of Ephorus and <lb/>
            Theopompus as to say that “ the one wanted the rein and the <pb n="124"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. It </note> <lb/>
            other the spar,"* to think that the slowness in the dullti, and <lb/>
            the ardour in the more impetuous, were to be fostered by edu­ <lb/>
            cation ? On the contrary,† he thought that the qualities of <lb/>
            each ought to be mixed with those of the other. 12. We must <lb/>
            so far accommodate ourselves, however, to feeble intellects, <lb/>
            that they may be trained only to that to which nature invites <lb/>
            them ; for thus they will do with more success the only thing <lb/>
            which they can do. But if richer material fall into our hands, <lb/>
            from which we justly conceive hopes of a true orator,‡ no <lb/>
            rhetorical excellence must be left unstudied. 13. For though <lb/>
            such a genius be more inclined, as indeed it must be, to the <lb/>
            exercise of certain powers, yet it will not be averse to that of <lb/>
            others, and will render them, by study, equal to those in which <lb/>
            it naturally excelled; just as the skilful trainer in bodily <lb/>
            exercise, (that I may adhere to my former illustration,) will <lb/>
            not, if he undertakes to form a pancratiast, teach him to <lb/>
            strike with his fist or his heel only, or instruct him merely in <lb/>
            wrestling, or only in certain artifices of wrestling, but will <lb/>
            practise him in everything pertaining to the pancratiastic art.</p>
          <p>There may perhaps be some pupil unequal to some of these <lb/>
            exercises. He must then apply chiefly to that in which he <lb/>
            can succeed. 14. For two things are especially to be avoided; <lb/>
            one, to attempt what cannot be accomplished; and the other, <lb/>
            to divert a pupil from what he does well to something else for <lb/>
            which he is less qualified. But if he be capable of instruc­ <lb/>
            tion, the tutor, like Nicostratus whom we, when young, knew <lb/>
            at an advanced age, will bring to bear upon him every art of <lb/>
            instruction alike, and render him invincible, as Nicostratus <lb/>
            was in wrestling and boxing,§ for success in both of which con­ <note type="footnote"> * See Cic. de Oral. iii. 9 ; Brut. c. 56; also Quintil. x. 1, 74. Con­ <lb/>

            must such training, indeed, be pursued by the teacher of the <lb/>
            future orator! For it is not enough that he should speak <lb/>
            concisely, or artfully, or vehemently, any more than for a <lb/>
            singing master to excel in acute, or middle, or grave tones <lb/>
            only, or even in particular subdivisions of them: since elo­ <lb/>

          <p>1. HAVING spoken thus fully concerning the duties of <lb/>
            teachers, I give pupils, for the present, only this one admoni­ <lb/>
            tion, that they are to love their tutors not less than their studies, <lb/>
            and to regard them as parents, not indeed of their bodies, but <lb/>
            of their minds. 2. Such affection contributes greatly to im­ <lb/>
            provement, for pupils, under its influence, will not only listen <lb/>
            with pleasure, but will believe what is taught them, and will <lb/>
            desire to resemble their instructors. They will come together, <lb/>
            in assembling for school, with pleasure and cheerfulness; they <lb/>
            will not be angry when corrected, and will be delighted when <lb/>
            praised; and they will strive, by their devotion to study, to be­ <lb/>
            come as dear as possible to the master. 3. For as it is the <lb/>
            duty of preceptors to teach, so it is that of pupils to show <lb/>
            themselves teachable; neither of these duties, else, will be of <lb/>
            avail without the other. And as the generation of man is <lb/>
            effected by both parents, and as you will in vain scatter seed, <lb/>
            unless the furrowed ground, previously softened, cherish it, <lb/>

          <p>Remarks on declamations, § 1, 2. Injudiciousness in the choice 01 <lb/>
            subjects has been an obstruction to improvement in eloquence, <lb/>
            3—5. On what sort of subjects pupils may be permitted to <lb/>
            declaim, 6—8. What alterations should be made in the common <lb/>
            practice, 9—15.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN the pupil has been well instructed, and sufficiently <lb/>
            exercised, in these preliminary studies, which are not in them­ <lb/>
            selves inconsiderable, but members and portions, as it were, <unclear>o</unclear> <lb/>
            higher branches of learning, the time will have nearly arrived <lb/>
            for entering on deliberative and judicial subjects. But before <lb/>
            I proceed to speak of those matters, I must say a few words <lb/>
            on the art of declamation, which, though the most recently <lb/>
            invented* of all exercises, is indeed by far the most useful. <lb/>
            2. For it comprehends within itself all those exercises of which <lb/>
            I have been treating, and presents us with a very close resem­ <lb/>
            blance to reality; and it has been so much adopted, accordingly, <lb/>
            that it is thought by many sufficient of itself to form oratory, <lb/>
            since no excellence in continued speaking can be specified, <lb/>
            which is not found in this prelude t to speaking. 3. The <lb/>
            practice however has so degenerated through the fault of the <lb/>
            teachers, that the license and ignorance of declaimers have been <lb/>
            among the chief causes that have corrupted eloquence. But <lb/>
            of that which is good by nature we may surely make a good <lb/>
            use. 4. Let therefore the subjects themselves, which shall be <lb/>
            imagined, be as like as possible to truth; and let declamations <lb/>
            to the utmost extent that is practicable, imitate those plead­ <lb/>
            ings for which they were introduced as a preparation. 5. For <lb/>

            to his son, but concealed it from the public authorities, telling them <lb/>
            that they had to perform certain sacred rites. When the rites were <lb/>

            never suffer students to handle such topics as are above belief, <lb/>
            and (to say the truth) poetical, so that they may expatiate and <lb/>
            exult in their subject, and swell forth as it were into full <lb/>
            body ? t 6. It would indeed be best not to suffer them ; but <lb/>
            at least let not the subjects, if grand and turgid, appear also, <lb/>
            to him who regards them with severe judgment, foolish and <lb/>
            ridiculous; so that, if we must grant the use of such topics, let <lb/>
            the declaimer swell himself occasionally to the full, provided <lb/>
            he understands that, as four-footed animals, when they have <lb/>
            been blown with green fodder, are cured by losing blood, and <lb/>
            thus return to food suited to maintain their strength, so must <lb/>
            his turgidity t be diminished, and whatever corrupt humours he <lb/>
            has contracted be discharged, if he wishes to be healthy and <lb/>
            strong; for otherwise his empty swelling will be hampered§ at <lb/>
            the first attempt at any real pleading.</p>
          <p>7. Those, assuredly, who think that the whole exercise of <lb/>
            declaiming is altogether different from forensic pleading, do <lb/>
            not see even the reason for which that exercise was instituted. <lb/>
            8. For, if it is no preparation for the forum, it is merely like <lb/>
            theatrical ostentation, or insane raving. To what purpose is <lb/>
            it to instruct a judge, who has no existence ? To state a case <lb/>
            that all know to be fictitious ? To bring proofs of a point on <lb/>
            which no man will pronounce sentence ? This indeed is nothing <lb/>
            more than trifling ; but how ridiculous is it to excite our feel­ <lb/>
            ings, and to work upon an audience with anger and sorrow, <lb/>
            unless we are preparing ourselves by imitations of battle for <lb/>
            serious contests and a regular field? 9. Will there then be <note type="footnote">death. After the pestilence had subsided, the father was accused of <lb/>

            no difference, it may be asked, between the mode of speaking <lb/>
            at the bar, and mere exercise in declamation ? I answer, that <lb/>
            if we speak for the sake of improvement, there will be no <lb/>
            difference.I wish, too, that it were made a part of the exer­ <lb/>
            ciseto use names ; * that causes more complicated, and requir­ <lb/>
            inglonger pleadings, were invented; that we were less afraid of <lb/>
            words in daily use ; and that we were in the habit of mingling <lb/>
            jests with our declamation ; all which points, however we may <lb/>
            have been practised in the schools in other respects, find us <lb/>
            novices at the bar.</p>
          <p>10. But even if a declamation be composed merely for dis­ <lb/>
            play, we ought surely to exert our voice in some degreeto <lb/>
            please the audience. For even in those oratorical composi <lb/>
            tions, which are doubtless based in some degree upon truth, but <lb/>
            are adapted to please the multitude, (such as are the panegy­ <lb/>
            rics which we read, and all that epideictic kind of eloquence,) <lb/>
            it is allowable to use great elegance, and not only to acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge the efforts of art, (which ought generally to be concealed <lb/>
            in forensic pleadings,) but to display it to those who are called <lb/>
            together for the purpose of witnessing it. 12. Declamation <lb/>
            therefore, as it is an imitation of real pleadings and delibera <lb/>
            tions, ought closely to resemble reality, but, as it carries with <lb/>
            it something of ostentation, to clothe itself in a certain ele­ <lb/>
            gance. 13. Such is the practice of actors, who do not pro­ <lb/>
            nounce exactly as we speak in common conversation, for such <lb/>
            pronunciation would be devoid of art; nor do they depart far <lb/>
            from nature, as by such a fault imitation would be destroyed ; <lb/>
            but they exalt the simplicity of familiar discourse with a cer­ <lb/>
            tain scenic grace.</p>
          <p>14. However some inconveniences will attend us from the <lb/>
            nature of the subjects which we have imagined, especially as <lb/>
            many particulars in them are left uncertain, which we settle as <lb/>
            suits our purpose, as age, fortune, children, parents, strength, <lb/>
            laws, and manners of cities; and other things of a similar <lb/>
            kind. 15. Sometimes, too, we draw arguments from the very <lb/>
            faults of the imaginary causes. But on each of these points <note type="footnote"> * Which were not introduces in declamations; for pater, tyrannicida, <lb/>

            object of the work intended by us has regard to the forma <lb/>

          <p>Some think instruction in oratory unnecessary, § 1, 2. Boasts and <lb/>
            practices of the ignorant, 3—5. Some study only parts of their <lb/>
            speeches ; want of connexion in their matter, 6, 7.</p>
          <p>1. FROM this point, then, I am to enter upon that portion <lb/>
            of the art with which those who have omitted the preceding <lb/>
            portions usually commence. I see, however, that some will <lb/>
            oppose me at the very threshold; men who think that <lb/>
            eloquence has no need of rules of this kind, and who, satisfied <lb/>
            with their own natural ability, and the common methods of <lb/>
            teaching and exercise in the schools, even ridicule my dili­ <lb/>
            gence ; following the example of certain professors of great <lb/>
            reputation. It was one of those characters, I believe, who, <lb/>
            being asked what a figure and what a thought was, answered <lb/>
            that " he did not know, but that, if it had any relation to his <lb/>
            subject, it would be found in his declamation." 2. Another <lb/>
            of them replied to a person who asked him “whether he was a <lb/>
            follower of Theodorus or Apollodorus," "I am a prize <lb/>
            fighter."* Nor could be indeed have escaped an avowal of <lb/>
            his ignorance with greater wit. But such men, as they have <note type="footnote"> * Percontanti Theodoreus an Apollodoreus asset. Ego, inquit, parmu­ <lb/>
            larius sum.] Theodorus and Apollodorus were well-known rhetoricians, <lb/>
            often mentioned by Quintilian, and leaders of parties. That par­ <lb/>

            they either wait, often for some days,. looking at the ceiling <lb/>

            or, exciting themselves with inarticulate sounds, as with a <lb/>
            trumpet, they adapt the wildest gestures of body, not to the <lb/>
            utterance, but to the excogitation of words.]</p>
          <p>5. Some, before they have conceived any thoughts, fix upon <lb/>
            certain heads, under which something eloquent is to be <lb/>
            introduced; but, after modulating their words to themselves, <lb/>
            aloud and for a long time, they desert their proposed arrange­ <lb/>
            ment, from despairing of the possibility of forming any <lb/>
            connexion, and then turn to one train of ideas, and again to <lb/>
            another, all equally common and hackneyed. 6. Those how­ <lb/>
            ever who seem to have most method, do not bestow their <lb/>
            efforts on fictitious causes, but on common topics, in which <lb/>
            they do not direct their view to any certain object, but throw <lb/>
            out detached thoughts as they occur to them. 7. Hence it <lb/>
            happens that their speech, being unconnected and made up of <lb/>
            different pieces, cannot hang together, but is like the note­ <lb/>
            books of boys, in which they enter promiscuously whatever has <lb/>

          <p>Why the ignorant often seem to speak with more force than the <lb/>
            learned, § 1—3. They attack more boldly, and are less afraid of <lb/>
            failure, 4, 5. But they cannot choose judiciously, or prove with <lb/>
            effect, 6. Their thoughts sometimes striking, 7. Apparent dis <lb/>
            advantages of learned polish, 8. Unlearned speakers often <lb/>
            vigorous in delivery, 9, 10. Occasionally too much admired by <lb/>
            teachers of oratory, 11, 12.</p>
          <p>1. I MUST not forbear to acknowledge, however, that people <lb/>
            in general adopt the notion that the unlearned appear to speak <lb/>
            with more force than the learned. But this opinion has its <lb/>
            origin chiefly in the mistake of those who judge erroneously, <lb/>
            and who think that what has no art has the more energy; just <lb/>
            as if they should conceive it a greater proof of strength to <lb/>
            break through a door than to open it, to rupture a knot than <lb/>
            to untie it, to drag an animal than to lead it. 2. By such <lb/>
            persons a gladiator, who rushes to battle without any know­ <lb/>
            ledge of arms, and a wrestler, who struggles with the whole <lb/>
            force of his body to effect that which he has once attempted, is <lb/>
            called so much the braver; though the latter is often laid <lb/>
            prostrate by his own strength, and the other, however violent <lb/>
            his assault, is withstood by a gentle turn of his adversary's <lb/>
            wrist....</p>
          <p>3. But there are some things concerning this point that very <lb/>
            naturally deceive the unskilful; for division, though it is of <lb/>
            great consequence in pleadings, diminishes the appearance of <lb/>
            strength; what is rough is imagined more bulky than what is <lb/>
            polished; and objects when scattered are thought more <lb/>
            numerous than when they are ranged in order.</p>
          <p>4. There is also a certain affinity between particular excel­ <lb/>
            lences and faults, in consequence of which a railer passes for a <lb/>
            free speaker, a rash for a bold one, a prolix for a copious one. <lb/>
            But an ignorant pleader rails too openly and too frequently, to <lb/>
            the peril of the party whose cause he has undertaken, and <lb/>
            often to his own. 5. Yet this practice attracts the notice of <lb/>
            people to him, because they readily listen to what they would <lb/>
            not themselves utter.</p>
          <p>Such a speaker, too, is far from avoiding that venturesome­ <note type="footnote"> * Illum, vehementis impetûs, excipit adversarii mollis articulus.] " The <lb/>
            flexible joint of the adversary withstands him [ who is] of violent <lb/>
            assault; vehumentis impetûs being a genitive of quality. </note> <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <pb n="132"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. a </note> <lb/>
            ness which lies in mere expression,. and makes desperate <lb/>
            efforts; whence it may happen that he who is always seeking <lb/>
            something extravagant, may sometimes find something great; <lb/>
            but it happens only seldom, and does not compensate for <lb/>
            undoubted faults.</p>
          <p>6. It is on this account that unlearned speakers seem some­ <lb/>
            times to have greater copiousness of language, because they <lb/>
            pour forth every thing; while the learned use selection and <lb/>
            moderation. Besides, unlearned pleaders seldom adhere to <lb/>
            the object of proving what they have asserted; by this means <lb/>
            they avoid what appears to judges of bad taste the dryness of <lb/>
            questions and arguments, and seek nothing else but matter in <lb/>
            which they may please the ears of the court with senseless <lb/>
            gratifications.</p>
          <p>7. Their fine sentiments themselves, too, at which alone they <lb/>
            aim, are more striking when all around them is poor and <lb/>
            mean; as lights are most brilliant, not amidst shades as <lb/>
            Cicero says,t but amidst utter darkness. Let such speakers <lb/>
            therefore be called as ingenious as the world pleases, provided <lb/>
            it be granted that a man of real eloquence would receive the <lb/>
            praise given to them as an insult.</p>
          <p>8. Still it must be allowed that learning does take away <lb/>
            something, as the file takes something from rough metal, the <lb/>
            whetstone from blunt instruments, and age from wine ; but it <lb/>
            takes away what is faulty; and that which learning has <lb/>
            polished is less only because it is better.</p>
          <p>9. But such pleaders try by their delivery to gain the repu­ <lb/>
            tation of speaking with energy; for they bawl on every <lb/>
            occasion and bellow out every thing with uplifted hand, as <note type="footnote"> * Illud quoque alterum, quod est in elocutione ipsâ, periculum, minùs <lb/>
            vitat.] Spalding says that by alterum periculum is meant the other sense <lb/>
            of the word danger, that is, the figurative sense, it being used here <lb/>
            metaphorically, distinct from "verum periculwm,” real danger. He should <lb/>
            rather have said that we should understand Quintilian as referring to <lb/>
            one kind of periculum which lies in the speaker's matter or thoughts, <lb/>
            and which he incurs maledicendo, sect. 4 ; and another kind which lies <lb/>
            merely in his style of speaking, in elocutione ipsâ, in which he is always <lb/>
            aiming at something grand and striking. I translate the first by <lb/>

            they call it, raging like madmen with incessant action, panting <lb/>
            and swaggering, and with every kind of gesture and movement <lb/>
            of the head. 10. To clap the hands together, to stamp the <lb/>
            foot on the ground, to strike the thigh, the breast, and the <lb/>
            forehead with the hand, makes a wonderful impression on an <lb/>
            audience of the lower order, if while the polished speaker, as he <lb/>
            knows how to temper, to vary, and to arrange the several <lb/>
            parts of his speech, so in delivery he knows how to adapt his <lb/>
            action to every variety of complexion in what he utters; and, <lb/>
            if any rule appears to him deserving of constant attention, it <lb/>
            would be that he should prefer always to be and to seem <lb/>
            modest. But the other sort of speakers call that force which <lb/>
            ought rather to be called violence.</p>
          <p>11. But we may at times see not only pleaders, but, what is <lb/>
            far more disgraceful, teachers, who, after having had some <lb/>
            short practice in speaking, abandon all method and indulge in <lb/>
            every kind of irregularity as inclination prompts them, and call <lb/>
            those who have paid more regard to learning than themselves, <lb/>
            foolish, lifeless, timid, weak, and whatever other epithet of <lb/>
            reproach occurs to them. 12. Let me then congratulate them <lb/>
            as having become eloquent without labour, without method, <lb/>
            without study; but let me, as I have long withdrawn from the <lb/>
            duties of teaching and of speaking in the forum, because I <lb/>
            thought it most honourable to terminate my career while my <lb/>
            services were still desired, console my leisure in meditating <lb/>
            and composing precepts which I trust will be of use to young <lb/>

          <p>1. BUT let no man require from me such a system of <lb/>
            precepts as is laid down by most authors of books of rules, a <note type="footnote"> * Mirè ad pullatum circulum facit.] The colour or dirt of the toga, <lb/>
            and still more of the tunica, which many of the poor wore without <lb/>

            system in which I should have to make certain laws, fixed by <lb/>
            immutable necessity, for all students of eloquence, commencing <lb/>
            with the proœmium, and what must be the character of it, say­ <lb/>
            ing that the statement of facts must come next, and what rule <lb/>
            must be observed in stating them; that after this must como <lb/>
            the proposition, or as some have preferred to call it, the ex­ <lb/>
            cursion;* and then that there must be a a certain order oj <lb/>
            questions; adding also other precepts, which some speakers <lb/>
            observe as if it were unlawful to do otherwise, and as if they <lb/>
            were acting under orders; 2. for rhetoric would be a very <lb/>
            easy and small matter, if it could be included in one short <lb/>
            body of rules, but rules must generally be altered to suit <lb/>
            the nature of each individual case, the time, the occasion, and <lb/>
            necessity itself; consequently, one great quality in an orator <lb/>
            is discretion, because he must turn his thoughts in various <lb/>
            directions, according to the different bearings of his subject. <lb/>
            3. What if you should direct a general, that, whenever he draws <lb/>
            up his troops for battle, he must range his front in line, extend <lb/>
            his wings to the right and left, and station his cavalry to de­ <lb/>
            fend his flanks ? Such a method will perhaps be the best, as <lb/>
            often as it is practicable; but it will be subject to alteration <lb/>
            from the nature of the ground, if a hill come in the way, if a <lb/>
            river interpose, if obstruction be caused by declivities, woods, <lb/>
            or any other obstacles: 4. the character of the enemy, too, <lb/>
            may make a change necessary, or the nature of the contest in <lb/>
            which he has to engage; and he will have to fight, sometimes <lb/>
            with his troops in extended line, sometimes in the form of <lb/>
            wedges, and to employ, sometimes his auxiliaries, and seme­ <lb/>
            times his own legions; and sometimes it will be of advantage <lb/>
            to turn his back in pretended flight. 5. In like manner, <lb/>
            whether an exordium be necessary or superfluous, whether it <lb/>
            should be short or long, whether it should be wholly addressed <lb/>
            to the judge, or, by the aid of some figure of speech, directed <lb/>
            occasionally to others, whether the statement of facts should <lb/>
            be concise or copious, continuous or broken, in the order of <lb/>
            events or in any other, the nature of the causes themselves <lb/>
            must show. 6. The case is the same with regard to the order <lb/>
            of examination, since, in the same cause, one question may <lb/>
            often be of advantage to one side, and another question to the <lb/>
            other, to be asked first; for the precepts of oratory are not <note type="footnote"> # See b. iv. c. 3, 4. </note> <pb n="135"/>
            <note type="margin"> on. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            established by laws or public decrees, but whatever is con <lb/>
            tained in them was discovered by expediency. 7. Yet I shall <lb/>
            not deny that it is in general of service to attend to rules, or I <lb/>
            should not write any; but if expediency shall suggest any <lb/>
            thing at variance with them, we shall have to follow it <lb/>
            deserting the authority of teachers.</p>
          <p>8. For my part I shall, above all things, <lb/>
            Direct, enjoin, and o'er and o'er repeat,. <lb/>
            that an orator, in all his pleadings, should keep two things <lb/>
            in view, what is becoming, and what is expedient; but it <lb/>
            is frequently expedient, and sometimes becoming, to make <lb/>
            some deviations from the regular and settled order, as, in <lb/>
            statues and pictures, we see the dress, look, and attitude, <lb/>
            varied. 8. In a statue, exactly upright, there is but very <lb/>
            little gracefulness,† for the face will look straight foi <lb/>
            ward, the arms hang down, the feet will be joined, and the <lb/>
            whole figure, from top to toe, will be rigidity itself; but a <lb/>
            gentle bend, or, to use the expression, motion of the <lb/>
            body, gives a certain animation to figures. Accordingly, the <lb/>
            hands are not always placed in the same position, and a <lb/>
            thousand varieties are given to the countenance. 10. Some <lb/>
            figures are in a running or rushing posture, some are seated <lb/>
            or reclining, some are uncovered, and others veiled, some par­ <lb/>
            take of both conditions. What is more distorted and elaborate <lb/>
            than the Discobolus of Myron?‡ Yet if any one should find <lb/>
            fault with that figure for not being upright, would he not <lb/>
            prove himself void of all understanding of the art, in which <lb/>
            the very novelty and difficulty of the execution is what is most <lb/>
            deserving of praise? 11. Such graces and charms rhetorical <lb/>
            figures afford, both such as are in the thoughts and such as <lb/>
            lie in words, for they depart in some degree from the right <lb/>
            line, and exhibit the merit of deviation from common practice <lb/>
            12. The whole face is generally represented in a painting, yet <lb/>
            Apelles painted the figure of Antigonus with only one side of <note type="footnote"> * A verge from Virgil, Æn. iii. 486, Prœdicam, et repetens iterumque <lb/>

            his face towards the spectator, that its disfigurement from the <lb/>
            loss of an eye might be concealed. Are not some things, in <lb/>
            like manner, to be concealed in speaking, whether, it may be, <lb/>
            because they ought not to be told, or because they cannot be <lb/>
            expressed as they deserve? 13 It was in this way that <lb/>
            Timanthes, a painter, I believe, of Cythnus,* acted, in the <lb/>
            picture by which he carried off the prize from Colotes, of <lb/>
            Teium; for when, at the sacrifice of Iphigenia, he had repre­ <lb/>
            sented Calchas looking sorrowful, Ulysses more sorrowful, and <lb/>
            had given to Menelaus the utmost grief that his art could <lb/>
            depict, not knowing, as his power of representing feeling was <lb/>
            exhausted, how he could fitly paint the countenance of the <lb/>
            father, he threw a veil over his head, and left his grief to be <lb/>
            estimated by the spectator from his own heart. 14. To this <lb/>
            device is not the remark of Sallust somewhat similar, For I <lb/>
            think it better to say nothing concerning Carthage, than to say <lb/>
            but little? For these reasons it has always been customary <lb/>
            with me, to bind myself as little as possible to rules which the <lb/>
            Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαθολιϰά</foreign>, and which we, translating the word as <lb/>
            well as we can, term universalia or perpetualia, " general" or <lb/>
            " constant for rules are rarely found of such a nature, that <lb/>
            they may not be shaken in some part, or wholly overthrown.</p>
          <p>But of rules I shall speak more fully, and of each in its <lb/>
            own place. 15. In the mean time, I would not have young <lb/>
            men think themselves sufficiently accomplished, if they have <lb/>
            learned by art some one of those little books on rhetoric, <lb/>
            which are commonly handed about, and fancy that they are thus <lb/>
            safe under the decrees of theory. The art of speaking depends <lb/>
            on great labour constant study, varied exercise, repeated <note type="footnote"> * Timanthes, opinor, Cythnius.] See Plin. H. N. XXXV. 36; Cic. Orat, <lb/>
            c. 22; Val. Max. viii. 11, ext. But it has been justly observed that <lb/>
            the painter took the hint from Euripides, Iphig. AuL 1550. Spalding. <lb/>
            What Euripides says is, that Agamemnon, when he saw Iphigenia <lb/>
            going to be sacrificed, uttered a groan, and, turning away his head, shed <lb/>
            tears, veiling his face with his robe." Spalding remarks that the <lb/>
            doubt implied in opinor refers to the country of Timanthes, Quintilian <lb/>
            not being certain whether he was a Cythnian or not; though why <lb/>
            Quintilian should have been so anxious to avoid error about the <lb/>
            painters county, when he was merely making a passing observation <lb/>
            on his picture, it is not easy to say. For further particulars about <lb/>
            Timanthes and his painting, the reader may consult Smith's Dict. of <lb/>

            trials, the deepest sagacity, and the readiest judgment. 16 <lb/>
            But it is assisted by rules, provided that they point out a fair <lb/>
            road, and not one single wheel-rut, from which he who thinks it <lb/>
            unlawful to decline, must be contented with the slow progress <lb/>
            of those who walk on ropes. Accordingly, we often quit the <lb/>
            main road, (which has been formed perhaps by the labour of <lb/>
            an army,) being attracted by a shorter path; or if bridges, <lb/>
            broken down by torrents, have intersected the direct way, we <lb/>
            are compelled to go round about; and if the gate be stopped <lb/>
            up by flames, we shall have to force a way through the wall. <lb/>
            17. The work of eloquence is extensive and of infinite variety, <lb/>
            presenting something new almost daily; nor will all that is <lb/>
            possible ever have been said of it. But the precepts which <lb/>
            have been transmitted to us I will endeavour to set forth, con­ <lb/>
            sidering, at the same time, which of them are the most valua­ <lb/>
            ble, whether anything in them seems likely to be changed for <lb/>
            the better, and whether any additions may be made to them, <lb/>
            or anything taken from them.</p>

          <p>Of the term rhetoric or oratory, § 1—4. Heads under which QUiD <lb/>
            tilian considers the art of oratory, 5.</p>
          <p>1. SOME who have translated <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥητοριϰὴ</foreign> from Gree<foreign xml:lang="grc">κ</foreign> into <lb/>
            Latin, have called it ars oratoria and oratrix. I would not <lb/>
            deprive those writers of their due praise, for endeavouring to <lb/>
            add to the copiousness of the Latin language, but all Greek <lb/>
            words do not obey our will, in attempting to render them from <lb/>
            the Greek, as all our words, in like manner, do not obey that <lb/>
            of the Greeks, when they try to express something of ours in <lb/>
            their own tongue. 2. This translation is not less harsh than <lb/>
            the essentia and entia of Flavius,* for the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign> : nor is <note type="footnote"> * It is probable that he is the same person whom writers in general <lb/>
            call Papirius Fabianus, a contemporary of Seneca, a philosopher well <lb/>
            acquainted with the nature of things, as he is called by Plin. H. N. <lb/>
            XXXVI. 24. Both the Senecas, father and son, say a great deal of him, <lb/>
            the one in the Præf. Controv. ii. p. 132—134 ; the other in the Epist. <lb/>
            ad Lucil. 100. Spalding. But from Sen. Ep. 58, it appears, according <lb/>
            to the emendation of Muretus, now generally adopted, that Cicero had <lb/>
            previously used the word. Compare Quint. viii. 3, 53. </note> <pb n="138"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.U </note> <lb/>
            it indeed exact, for oratoria will be taken in the same sense at <lb/>
            elocutoria, oratrix as elocutrix, but the word rhetorice, or <lb/>
            which we are speaking, is the same sort of word as eloquentia, <lb/>
            and it is doubtless used in two senses by the Greeks. 3. In <lb/>
            one acceptation it is an adjective, ars rhetorica, as navis <lb/>
            piratica: in the other a substantive, like philosophia or ami­ <lb/>
            cilia. We wish it now to have the signification of a sub­ <lb/>
            stantive, just as <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραμματιϰὴ</foreign> is rendered by the substantive <lb/>
            literatura, not by literatrix, which would be similar to oratrix, <lb/>
            nor by literatoria, which would be similar to oratoria; but for <lb/>
            the word rhetorice, no equivalent Latin word has been found. <lb/>
            4. Let us not, however, dispute about the use of it, especially <lb/>
            as we must adopt many other Greek words; for if I may use <lb/>
            the terms physicus, musicus, geometres, I shall offer no un­ <lb/>
            seemly violence to them by attempting to turn them into <lb/>
            , Latin; and since Cicero himself uses a Greek title for the <lb/>
            books which he first wrote upon the art, we certainly need <lb/>
            be under no apprehension of appearing to have rashly trusted <lb/>
            the greatest of orators as to the name of his own art.</p>
          <p>RHETORIC, then, (for we shall henceforth use this term with­ <lb/>
            out dread of sarcastic objections,) will be best divided, in <lb/>
            opinion, in sueh a manner, that we may speak first of the art, <lb/>
            next of the artist, and then of the work. The art will be that <lb/>
            which ought to be attained by study, and is the knowledge how <lb/>
            to speak well. The artificer is he who has thoroughly acquired <lb/>
            the art, that is, the orator, whose business is to speak well. <lb/>
            The work is what is achieved by the artificer, that is, good <lb/>
            speaking. All these are to be considered under special heads ; <lb/>
            but of the particulars that are to follow, I shall speak in their <lb/>
            several places; at present I shall proceed to consider what <lb/>
            is to be said on the first general head. <pb n="139"/>

          <p>What rhetoric is, § 1, 2. To call it the power of persuading is to give <lb/>
            an insufficient definition of it, 3—9. To call it the power of per­ <lb/>
            suading by speech is not sufficient, 10, 11. Other definitions, 12— <lb/>
            23. That of Gorgias in Plato ; that of Plato or Socrates in the <lb/>
            Phædrus, 24—31. That of Cornelius Celsus, 32. Other defi. <lb/>
            nitions more approved by Quintilian, 33—37. Quintilian's own <lb/>
            definition, 38.</p>
          <p>1. FIRST of all, then, we have to consider what rhetoric is. <lb/>
            It is, indeed, defined in various ways; but its definition gives <lb/>
            rise chiefly to two considerations, for the dispute is, in general, <lb/>
            either concerning the quality of the thing itself ,or concerning <lb/>
            the comprehension of the terms in which it is defined. The <lb/>
            first and chief difference of opinion on the subject is, that <lb/>
            some think it possible even for bad men to have the name of <lb/>
            orators; while others (to whose opinion I attach myself) main­ <lb/>
            tain that the name, and the art of which we are speaking, can <lb/>
            be conceded only to good men.*</p>
          <p>2. Of those who separate the talent of speaking from the <lb/>
            greater and more desirable praise of a good life, some have <lb/>
            called rhetoric merely a power, some a science, but not a vir­ <lb/>
            tue,t some a habit, some an art, but having nothing in com­ <lb/>
            mon with science and virtue; some even an abuse of art, that <lb/>
            is, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαϰοτεχνία</foreign>.‡ 3. All these have generally supposed, that <lb/>
            the business of oratory lies either in persuading, or in speaking <lb/>
            in a manner adapted to persuade, for such art may be attained <lb/>
            by one who is far from being a good man. The most common <lb/>
            definition therefore is, that oratory is the power of persuading. <lb/>
            What I call a power, some call a faculty, and others a talent, <lb/>
            but that this discrepancy may be attended with no ambiguity, <note type="footnote"> * This was the opinion also of Cato the Censor, given in his bock <lb/>

            from the studious. Orator est, Marce fili, vir bonus dicendi peritus. <lb/>
            Antonius, in Cic. De Orat. ii. 20, distinguishes the orator from the good <lb/>

            Isocrates if the treatise on the art, which is in circulation <lb/>
            under his name, is really his.. That rhetorician, though he <lb/>
            had none of the feelings of those who defame the business of <lb/>
            the orator, gives too rash a definition of the art when he says, <lb/>
            “ That rhetoric is the worker of persuasion, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πειθου̃ς δημιουργός</foreign> <lb/>
            for I shall not allow myself to use the peculiar term t that <lb/>
            Ennius applles to Marcus Cethegus, SUADÆ medulla. 5. In <lb/>
            Plato too, Gorgias in the Dialogue inscribed with his name, <lb/>
            says almost the same thing; but Plato wishes it to be leceived <lb/>
            as the opinion of Gorgias, not as his own. Cicero in several <lb/>
            passages‡ of his writings, has said, that the duty of an orator <lb/>

            Phryne too, people think, was freed from peril, not by the <lb/>
            pleading of Hyperides, though it was admirable, but by the <lb/>
            exposure of her figure, which, otherwise most striking, he had <lb/>
            uncovered by opening her robe. If, then, all such things per­ <lb/>
            suade, the definition of which we have spoken is not satis­ <lb/>
            factory.</p>
          <p>10. Those, accordingly, have appeared to themselves more <lb/>
            exact, who, though they have the same general opinion as to <lb/>
            rhetoric, have pronounced it to be the power of persuading by <lb/>
            speaking. This definition Gorgias gives, in the Dialogue which <lb/>
            we have just mentioned, being forced to do so, as it were, by <lb/>
            Socrates. Theodectes, if the treatise on rhetoric, which is <lb/>
            inscribed with his name, is his, (or it may rather, perhaps, as <lb/>
            has been supposed, be the work of Aristotle,) does not dissent' <lb/>
            from Gorgias, for it is asserted in that book, that the object of <lb/>
            oratory is to lead men by speaking to that which the speaker <lb/>
            wishes. 11. But not even this definition is sufficiently com­ <lb/>
            prehensive ; for not only the orator, but others, as harlots, flat­ <lb/>
            terers, and seducers, † persuade, or lead to that which they <lb/>
            wish, by speaking. But the orator, on the contrary, does not <lb/>
            always persuade; so that sometimes this is not his peculiar <lb/>
            object; sometimes it is an object common to him with others, <lb/>
            who are very different from orators. 12. Yet Apollodorus <lb/>
            varies but little from this definition, as he says, that the first <lb/>
            and supreme object of judicial pleading is to persuade the <lb/>
            judge, and to lead him to whatever opinion the speaker may <lb/>
            wish, for he thus subjects the orator to the power of fortune, <lb/>
            so that, if he does not succeed in persuading, he cannot retain <lb/>
            the name of an orator. 13, Some, on the other hand, detach <lb/>
            themselves from all considerations as to the event, as Aristotle, <note type="footnote"> * When he was prætor in Spain he had put to death a body of <lb/>
            Lusitanians after pledging the public faith that their lives should be <lb/>

            who says, that oratory is the power of finding out whatever can <lb/>
            persuade in speaking .* But this definition has not only the <lb/>
            fault of which we have just spoken, but the additional one of <lb/>
            comprehending nothing but invention, which, without elocu­ <lb/>
            tion, cannot constitute oratory. 14. To Hermagoras, who says, <lb/>
            that the object of oratory is to speak persuasively, and to <lb/>
            others, who express themselves to the same purpose, though <lb/>
            not in the same words, but tell us that the object of oratory is <lb/>
            to say all that ought to be said in order to persuade, a suf­ <lb/>
            ficient answer was given when we showed that to persuade is <lb/>
            not the business of the orator only.</p>
          <p>^ 515. Various other opinions have been added to these, for <lb/>
            some have thought that oratory may be employed about all <lb/>
            subjects, others only about political affairs, but which of these <lb/>
            notions is nearer to truth, I shall inquire in that part of my <lb/>
            work which will be devoted to the question. 16. Aristotle <lb/>
            seems to have put everything in the power of oratory when he <lb/>
            says, that it is the power of saying† on every subject whatever <lb/>
            can be found to persuade: and such is the case with Pa­ <lb/>
            trocles,: who, indeed, does not add on every subject, but, as he <lb/>
            makes no exception, shows that his idea is the same, for he <lb/>
            calls oratory the power of finding whatever is persuasive in <lb/>
            speaking, both which definitions embrace invention alone. <lb/>
            Theodorus,§ in order to avoid this defect, decides oratory to <lb/>
            be the power of discovering and expressing, with elegance, <lb/>
            whatever is credible on any subject whatever. IT. But, while <lb/>
            one who is not an orator may find out what is credible as well <lb/>
            as what is persuasive, he, by adding on any subject whatever <lb/>
            grants more than the preceding makers of definitions, and <lb/>
            allows the title of a most honourable art to those who may <note type="footnote"> * Tov <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρη̃σαι</foreign> rb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνδεχόμενον πιθανον</foreign>.

            blies, and says that he treats both of what is just and what is <lb/>
            unjust; and Socrates allows him the art of persuading, but not <lb/>
            of teaching.</p>
          <p>19. Those who have not granted all subjects to the orator, <lb/>
            have made distinctions in their definitions, as they were neces­ <lb/>
            sitated, with more anxiety and verbosity. One of these is <lb/>
            Ariston, a disciple of Critolaus, the Peripatetic, whose defi­ <lb/>
            nition of oratory is, that it is the science of discovering and <lb/>
            expressing what ought to be said on political affairs, in language <lb/>
            adapted to persuade the people. SO He considers oratory a <lb/>
            science, because he is a Peripatetic, not a virtue, like the <lb/>
            Stoics,. but, in adding adapted to persuade the people, he <lb/>
            throws dishonour on the art of oratory, as if he thought it <lb/>
            unsuited to persuade the learned. But of all who think <lb/>
            that the orator is to discourse only on political questions, it <lb/>
            may be said, once for all, that many duties of the orator are <lb/>
            set aside by them; for instance, all laudatory speaking, which <lb/>
            is the third part of oratory.t 21. Theodorus, of Gadara, (to <lb/>
            proceed with those who have thought oratory an art, not a <lb/>
            virtue,) defines more cautiously, for he says, (let me borrow <lb/>
            the words of those who have translated his phraseology from <lb/>
            the Greek,) that oratory is an art that discovers, and judges, <lb/>
            and enunciates with suitable eloquence, according to the measure <lb/>
            of that which may be found adapted to persuading, in any sub­ <lb/>
            feet connected with political affairs. 22. Cornelius Celsus, in <lb/>
            like manner, says that the object of oratory is to speak per­ <lb/>
            suasively on doubtful and political matters. To these defi. <note type="footnote"> 0 Cicero, de Orate iiL 18, says that the Stoics alone, of all the philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, have called eloquence virtue and wisdom ; see also Acad. Quæst. <lb/>
            i. 2. The Stoics necessarily held this opinion, as they also gave <lb/>
            dialectics and physics the name of virtues, Cio. de Fin. ii. 21; and of <lb/>
            dialectics, taken in its widest sense, oratory or rhetoric may be considered <lb/>
            as a part. The Stoics, indeed, make the word 71the basis of all <lb/>
            their definitions of virtues; see Stob. Eclog. p. 167, ed. Antv. ; and <lb/>
            virtue itself is defined by Musonius Rufus, the master of Epictetus, as <lb/>
            Ynowledge not merely theoretical, but practical: Stob. Serai, p. 204, ed. <lb/>
            Tigur. If therefore the definition of eloquence in the text had pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded from a Stoic, and not a Peripatetic, he would have acknowledged <lb/>
            it to be a virtue by the very admission that it was knowledge. See c. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.II </note> <lb/>
            uitions there are some, not very dissimilar, given by others, <lb/>
            such as this: oratory is the power of judging and discoursing <lb/>
            on such civil questions as are submitted to it, with a certaid <lb/>
            persuasiveness, a certain action of the body, and a certain mode <lb/>
            of delivering what it expresses. 23. There are a thousand <lb/>
            other definitions, but either similar, or composed of similar <lb/>
            elements, which we shall notice when we come to treat upon <lb/>
            the subjects of oratory.</p>
          <p>Some have thought it neither a power, nor a science, nor an <lb/>
            art; Critolaus calls it the practice of speaking; (for such is <lb/>
            -the meaning of the word :) Athenseus,* the art of deceiv­ <lb/>
            ing.f 21. But most writers, satisfied with reading a few <lb/>
            passages from Plato's Gorgias, unskilfully extracted by their <lb/>
            predecessors, (for they neither consult the whole of that <lb/>
            dialogue, nor any of the other writings of Plato,) have fallen <lb/>
            into a very grave error, supposing that that philosopher enter­ <lb/>
            tained such an opinion as to think that oratory was not an art, <lb/>
            but a certain skilfulness in flattering and pleasing; 25. or, as <lb/>
            he says in another place, the simulation of one part of polity, <lb/>
            and the fourth sort of flattery, for he assigns two parts of <lb/>
            polity to the body, medicine, and, as they interpret it, exercise, <lb/>
            and two to the mind, law and justice, and then calls the art of <lb/>
            cooks the flattery or simulation of medicine, and the art of <lb/>
            dealers in slaves the simulation of the effects of exetcise, as <lb/>
            they produce a false complexion by paint and the appearance <lb/>
            of strength by unsolid fat; the simulation of legal science he <lb/>
            calls sophistry, and that of justice rhetoric. 26. All this is, <lb/>
            indeed, expressed in that Dialogue, and uttered by Socrates, <lb/>
            under whose person Plato seems to intimate what he thinks; <lb/>
            but some of his dialogues were composed merely to refute those <lb/>
            who argued on the other side, and are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑλεγϰτιϰοι</foreign> <lb/>
            others were written to teach, and are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δογματιϰοί</foreign> 27. <lb/>
            But Socrates, or Plato, thought that sort of oratory, which was <lb/>
            then practised, to be of a dogmatic character, for he speaks of <lb/>
            it as being <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατὰ του̃τον τὸν τόπον</foreign> Oil <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύμει̑ςπολιτεύεσε</foreign> § '' ac­ <lb/>

            and understands oratory of a sincere and honourable nature. <lb/>
            The dispute with Gorgias is accordingly thus terminated: " It" <lb/>
            is therefore necessary that the orator be a just man, and that <lb/>
            the just man should wish to do just things."* 28. When this­ <lb/>
            has been said, Gorgias is silent, but Polus resumes the subject, <lb/>
            who, from the ardour of youth, is somewhat inconsiderate, and <lb/>
            in reply to whom the remarks on simulation and flattery are <lb/>
            made. Callicles, who is even more vehement, speaks next, <lb/>
            but is reduced to the conclusion, that " he who would be a <lb/>
            true orator must be a just man, and must know what is just † <lb/>
            and it is therefore evident, that oratory was not considered by <lb/>
            Plato an evil, but that he thought true oratory could not be <lb/>
            attained by any but a just and good man. 29. In the Phædrus <lb/>
            he sets forth still more clearly, that the art cannot be fully <lb/>
            acquired without a knowledge of justice, an opinion to which I <lb/>
            also assent. Would Plato, if he had held any other senti­ <lb/>
            ments, have written the Defence of Socrates, and the Eulogy <lb/>
            of those who fell in defence of their country compositions <lb/>
            which are certainly work for the orator? 30. But he has <lb/>
            even inveighed against that class of men who used their <lb/>
            abilities in speaking for bad ends. Socrates also thought the <lb/>
            speech, which Lysias had written for him when accused, im­ <lb/>
            proper for him to use, though it was a general practice, at that <lb/>
            time, to compose for parties appearing before the judges <lb/>
            speeches which they themselves might deliver; and thus <lb/>
            an elusion of the law,§ by which one man was not allowed <lb/>
            to speak for another, was effected. 31. By Plato, also, <lb/>

            of the same opinion with those to whom I have just referred, <lb/>

            polity; Cicero calls it a part of civil polity ; and a knowledge <lb/>
            of civil polity, he thinks, is nothing less than wisdom itself. <lb/>
            Some have made it a part of philosophy, among whom is <lb/>
            Isocrates.* 34. With this character! of it, the definition that <lb/>
            oratory is the science of speaking well, agrees excellently, for <lb/>
            it embraces a the virtues of oratory at once, and includes also <lb/>
            tho character; of the true orator, as he cannot speak well <lb/>
            umlesshe be a good man. 35. To the same purpose is tho <lb/>
            definition of Chrysippus, derived from Cleanthes,‡ the science <lb/>
            of speaking properly. There are more definitions in the same <lb/>
            philosopher, but they relate rather to other § questions. A defi­ <lb/>
            nition framed in these terms, to persuade to what is necessary, <lb/>
            would convey the same notion, except that it makes the art <note type="footnote"> * This we may suppose to have been said in the lost treatise men­ <lb/>

            depend on the result. 30. Areus* defines oratory well, say <lb/>
            ing that it is to speak according to the excellence of speech <lb/>
            Those also exclude bad men from oratory who consider it as <lb/>
            the knowledge of civil duties, since they deem such knowledge <lb/>
            virtue; but they confine it within too narrow bounds, and to <lb/>
            political questions. Albutius,+ no obscure professor or author, <lb/>
            allows that it is the art of speaking well, but errs in giving it <lb/>
            limitations, adding, on political questions, and with probability, <lb/>
            of both which restrictions I have already disposed; those, too, <lb/>
            are men of good intention, who consider it the business of <lb/>
            oratory to think and speak rightly.</p>
          <p>37. These are almost all the most celebrated definitions, and <lb/>
            those about which there is the most controversy; for to <lb/>
            discuss all would neither be much to the purpose, nor would <lb/>
            be in my power; since a foolish desire, as I think, has pre <lb/>
            vailed among the writers of treatises on rhetoric, to define <lb/>
            nothing in the same terms that another had already used ; a <lb/>
            vain-glorious practice which shall be far from me. 38. For I <lb/>
            shall say, not what I shall invent, but what I shall approve; <lb/>
            as, for instance, that oratory is the art of speaking well; <lb/>
            since, when the best definition is found, he who seeks for <lb/>
            another must seek for a worse.</p>
          <p>This being admitted, it is evident at the same time what <lb/>
            object, what highest and ultimate end, oratory has ; that object <lb/>
            or end which is called in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλος</foreign> and to which every art <lb/>
            tends; for if oratory be the art of speaking well, its object and <lb/>
            ultimate end must be to speak well.</p>

          <p>Oratory said by some to be a pernicious art, because it may be <lb/>

            some are accustomed to declaim violently against it, and, what <lb/>
            is most ungenerous, to make use of the power of oratory to lay <lb/>
            accusations against oratory; 2. they say that eloquence is that <lb/>
            which saves the wicked from punishment; by the dishonesty oj <lb/>
            which the innocent are at times condemned; by which de­ <lb/>
            liberations are influenced to the worse; by which not only <lb/>
            popular seditions and tumults, but even inexpiable wars, are <lb/>
            excited ; and of which the efficacy is the greatest when it exerts <lb/>
            itself for falsehood against truth. 3. Even to Socrates, the comic <lb/>
            writers make it a reproach that he taught how to make the worse <lb/>
            reason appear the better; and Plato on his part says that <lb/>
            Tisias and Gorgias* professed the same art. 4. To these <lb/>
            they add examples from Greek and Roman history, and give a <lb/>
            list of persons who, by exerting such eloquence as was mis­ <lb/>
            chievous, not only to individuals but to communities, have <lb/>
            disturbed. or overthrown the constitutions of whole states; <lb/>
            asserting that eloquence on that account was banished from the <lb/>
            state of Lacedæmon, and that even at Athens, where the <lb/>
            orator was forbidden to move the passions, the powers of <lb/>
            eloquence were in a manner curtailed.</p>
          <p>5. Under such a mode of reasoning, neither will generals, <lb/>
            nor magistrates, nor medicine, nor even wisdom itself, be of <lb/>
            any utility; for Flaminius t was a general, and the Gracchi, <lb/>
            Saturnini, and Glauciæ were magistrates; in the hands of <lb/>
            physicians poisons have been found; and among those who <lb/>
            abuse the name of philosophers have been occasionally <lb/>
            detected the most horrible crimes. 6. We must reject food, <lb/>

            7. Will it be denied, however, that the blind Appius, by the <lb/>
            force of his eloquence, broke off a dishonourable treaty of peace <lb/>
            about to be concluded with Pyrrhus? Was not the divine <lb/>
            eloquence of Cicero, in opposition to the agrarian laws, even <lb/>
            popular?* Did it not quell the daring of Catiline, and gain. <lb/>
            in the toga, the honour of thanksgivings, the highest† that is <lb/>
            given to generals victorious in the field ? 8. Does not oratory <lb/>
            often free the alarmed minds of soldiers from fear and per­ <lb/>
            suade them, when they are going to face so many perils in <lb/>
            battle, that glory is better than life ? Nor indeed would the <lb/>
            Lacedæmoniaus and Athenians influence me more than the <lb/>
            people of Rome, among whom the highest respect has always <lb/>
            been paid to orators. 9. Nor do I think that founders of cities <lb/>
            would have induced their unsettled multitudes to form them­ <lb/>
            selves into communities by any other means than by the influ­ <lb/>
            ence of the art of speaking; ‡ nor would legislators, without the <lb/>
            utmost power of oratory, have prevailed on men to bind themselves <lb/>
            to submit to the dominion of law. 10. Even the very rules <lb/>
            for the conduct of life, beautiful as they are by nature, have <lb/>
            yet greater power in forming the mind when the radiance of <lb/>
            eloquence illumines the beauty of the precepts. Though the <lb/>
            weapons of eloquence, therefore, have effect in both directions, <lb/>
            it is not just that that should be accounted an evil which we <lb/>
            may use to a good purpose.</p>
          <p>II. But these points may perhaps be left to the considera­ <lb/>
            tion of those who think that the substance of eloquence lies <lb/>
            in the power to persuade. But if eloquence be the art of <lb/>
            speaking well, (the definition which I adopt,) so that a true <lb/>
            orator must be, above all, a good man. it must assuredly be <lb/>
            acknowledged that it is a useful art. 12. In truth, the <lb/>
            sovereign deity, the parent of all things, the architect of the <lb/>
            world, has distinguished man from other beings, such at least <lb/>
            as were to be mortal, by nothing more than by the faculty of <lb/>
            speech. 13. Bodily frames superior in size, in strength, in <lb/>

            creatures, and observe, too, that they have less need than we <lb/>
            have of external assistance. To walk, to feed themselves, <lb/>
            to swim over water, they learn, in less time than we can, from <lb/>
            nature herself, without the aid of any other teacher. 14. <lb/>
            Most of them, also, are equipped against cold by the produce <lb/>
            of their own bodies; weapons for their defence are born with <lb/>
            them; and their food lies before their faces; to supply all <lb/>
            which wants mankind have the greatest difficulty. The <lb/>
            divinity has therefore given us reason, superior to all other <lb/>
            qualities, and appointed us to be sharers of it with the im­ <lb/>
            mortal gods. 15. But reason could neither profit us so much, <lb/>
            nor manifest itself so plainly within us, if we could not express <lb/>
            by speech what we have conceived in our minds; a faculty <lb/>
            which we see wanting in other animals, far more than, to a <lb/>
            certain degree, understanding and reflection. 16. For to con­ <lb/>
            trive habitations, to construct nests, to bring up their young, <lb/>
            to hatch them.- to lay up provision for the winter, to produce <lb/>
            works inimitable by us, (as those of wax and honey,) is perhaps <lb/>
            a proof of some portion of reason ; but as, though they do such <lb/>
            things, they are without the faculty of speech, they are called <lb/>
            dumb and irrational. 17. Even to men, to whom speech has <lb/>
            been denied, of how little avail is divine reason ! If, therefore, <lb/>
            we have received from the gods nothing more valuable than <lb/>
            speech, what can we consider more deserving of cultivation <lb/>
            and exercise ? or in what can we more strongly desire to be <lb/>
            superior to other men, than in that by which man himself is <lb/>
            superior to other animals, especially as in no kind of exertion <lb/>
            does labour more plentifully bring its reward ? 18. This will <lb/>
            be so much the more evident, if we reflect from what origin, <lb/>
            and to what extent, the art of eloquence has advanced, and <lb/>
            how far it may still be improved. 19. For, not to mention <lb/>
            how beneficial it is, and how becoming in a man of virtue, to <lb/>
            defend his friends,. to direct a senate or people by his counsels, <lb/>
            or to lead an army to whatever enterprise he may desire, is it <lb/>

          <p>Oratory is manifestly an art, § 1—4. Yet some have denied that it is, <lb/>
            and said that its power is wholly from nature, 5—8. Examples <lb/>
            from other arts, 9, 10. Every one that speaks is not an orator, <lb/>
            11-] 3. Opinion of Aristotle, 14. Other charges against oratory • <lb/>
            that it has no peculiar subject or matter, and that it sometimes <lb/>
            deceives, 15—18. Refutation of these charges, 19—21. Unfairly <lb/>
            objected to it that it has no proper end, 22—26. Not pernicious <lb/>
            because it sometimes misleads, 27—29. Another objection, that <lb/>
            it may be exerted on either side of a question, and that it <lb/>
            contradicts itself; answered. 30—36. Oratory is sometimes <lb/>
            ignorant of the truth of what it asserts; but the same is the <lb/>
            case with other arts and sciences, 36—40. Confirmation of its <lb/>
            being an art, 41 —43.</p>
          <p>1. THERE would be no end if I should allow myself to ex­ <lb/>
            patiate, and indulge my inclination, on this head. Let us <lb/>
            proceed, therefore, to the question that follows, whether oratory <lb/>
            be an art. 2. That it is an art, every one of -those who have <lb/>
            given rules about eloquence has been so far from doubting, <lb/>
            that it is shown by the very titles of their books, that they are <lb/>
            written on the oratorical art; and Cicero also says, that what, <lb/>
            is called oratory is artificial eloquence. This distinction, it is <lb/>
            not only orators that have claimed for themselves, (since they <lb/>
            may be thought, perhaps, to have given their profession some­ <lb/>
            thing more than its due,) but the philosophers, the Stoics, and <lb/>
            most of the Peripatetics, agree with them. 3. For myself, I <lb/>
            confess, that I was in some doubt whether I should look upon <lb/>
            this part of the inquiry as necessary to be considered; for who <lb/>
            is so destitute, I will not say of learning, but of the common <lb/>
            understanding of mankind, as to imagine that the work of <lb/>
            building, or weaving, or moulding vessels out of clay, is an <lb/>
            art, but that oratory, the greatest and noblest of works, has <lb/>
            attained such a height of excellence without being an art ? <lb/>
            Those, indeed, who have maintained the contrary opinion, I <lb/>
            suppose not so much to have believed what they advanced, ad <lb/>
            to have been desirous of exercising their powers on a subject <pb n="152"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.II </note> <lb/>
            of difficulty, like Polycrates, when he eulogized Busiris and <lb/>
            Clytæmnestra; though he is said also to have written the <lb/>
            speech that was delivered against Socrates; nor would that in. <lb/>
            deed have been inconsistent with his other compositions.-</p>
          <p>5. Some will have oratory to be a natural talent, though <lb/>
            they do not deny that it may be assisted by art. Thus <lb/>
            Antonius, in Cicero de Oratore,t says that oratory is an effect <lb/>
            of observation, not an art; but this is not advanced that we <lb/>
            may receive it as true, but that the character of Antonius, an <lb/>
            orator who tried to conceal the art that he used, may be sup­ <lb/>
            ported. 6. But Lysias seems to have really entertained this <lb/>
            opinion; for which the argument is, that the ignorant, and <lb/>
            barbarians, and slaves, when they speak for themselves, say <lb/>
            something that resembles an exordium, they state facts, prove, <lb/>
            refute, and (adopting the form of a peroration) deprecate. <lb/>
            7. The supporters of this notion also avail themselves of certain <lb/>
            quibbles upon words, that nothing that proceeds from art was <lb/>
            before art, but that mankind have always been able to speak <lb/>
            for themselves and against others; that teachers of the art <lb/>
            appeared only in later times, and first of all about the age of <lb/>
            Tisias and Corax; ‡ that oratory was therefore before art, and <lb/>
            is consequently not an art. 8. As to the period, indeed, in <lb/>
            which the teaching of oratory commenced, I am not anxious <lb/>
            to inquire; we find Phoenix, however, in Homer, as an <lb/>
            instructor, not only in acting but in speaking, as well as <lb/>
            several other orators; we see all the varieties of eloquence in <lb/>
            the three generals, || and contests in eloquence proposed <lb/>

            It would even be sufficient for me to observe, that everything <lb/>
            which art has brought to perfection had its origin in nature, <lb/>
            else, from the number of the arts must be excluded medicine, <lb/>
            which resulted from the observation of what was beneficial or <lb/>
            detrimental to health, and which, as some think, consists <lb/>
            wholly in experiments, for somebody had, doubtless, bound up <lb/>
            a wound before the dressing of wounds became an art, and had <lb/>
            allayed fever by repose and abstinence, not because he saw <lb/>
            the reason of such regimen, but because the malady itself <lb/>
            drove him to it. 10. Else, too, architecture must not be con­ <lb/>
            sidered an art, for the first generation of men built cottages <lb/>
            without art; nor music, since singing and dancing, to some sort <lb/>
            of tune, are practised among all nations. 11. So, if any kind <lb/>
            of speaking whatever is to be called oratory, I will admit that <lb/>
            oratory existed before it was an art; but if every one that <lb/>
            speaks is not an orator, and if men in early times did not <lb/>
            speak as orators, our reasoners must confess that an orator is <lb/>
            formed by art, and did not exist before art. This being <lb/>
            admitted, another argument which they use is set aside, <lb/>
            namely, that that has no concern with art which a man who has <lb/>
            not learned it can do, but that men who have not learned <lb/>
            oratory can make speeches. 12. To support this argument <lb/>
            they observe, that Demades,* a waterman, and Æschines,† an <lb/>
            actor, were orators; but they are mistaken; for he who has <lb/>
            not learned to be an orator cannot properly be called one, and <lb/>
            it may be more justly said, that those men learned late in life, <lb/>
            than that they never learned at all; though Æschines, indeed; <lb/>
            had some introduction to learning in his youth as hisfather <lb/>
            was a teacher ; nor is It certain that Demades did not learn; <lb/>
            and he might, by constant practice in speaking, which is the <lb/>
            most efficient mode of learning, have made himself master of <lb/>
            all the power of language that he ever possessed. 13. But <lb/>
            we may safely say, that he would have been a better speaker <lb/>
            if he had learned, for he never ventured to write out his <lb/>
            speeches for publication,‡ though we know that he produced <lb/>
            considerable effectin delivering them.</p>

            variance with my opinion in his Gryllus;* but he has also <lb/>
            written three books on the art of rhetoric, in the first of which <lb/>
            he not only admits that it is an art, but allows it a connexion <lb/>
            with civil polity, as well as with logic.t 15. Critolaus,‡ and <lb/>
            Athenodorus, of Rhodes, have advanced many arguments on <lb/>
            the opposite side. Agnon,§ by the very title of his book, in <lb/>
            which he avows that he brings an accusation against rhetoric, <lb/>
            has deprived himself of all claim to be trusted.|| As to Epi­ <lb/>
            curus,¶ who shrunk from all learning, I am not at all <lb/>
            surprised at him.</p>
          <p>16. These reasoners say a great deal, but it is based upon <lb/>
            few arguments; I shall therefore reply to the strongest of <lb/>
            them in a very few words, that the discussion may not be <lb/>
            protracted to an infinite length. 17. Their first argument is <lb/>
            with regard to the subject or matter, “ for all arts," they say, <lb/>
            “ have some subject,” as is true, “ but that oratory has no pe­ <lb/>
            culiar subject,” an assertion which I shall subsequently prove <lb/>
            to be false. 18. The next argument is a more false charge, <lb/>
            for “ no art," they say, “ acquiesces in false conclusions, since <lb/>
            art cannot be founded but on perception, which is always <lb/>
            true; but that oratory adopts false conclusions, and is, conse­ <lb/>
            quently, not an art." 19. That oratory sometimes advances <lb/>
            what is false instead of what is true, I will admit, but I shall <lb/>
            not for that reason acknowledge that the speaker acquiesces in <lb/>
            false conclusions, for it is one thing for a matter to appear in <lb/>
            a certain light to a person himself, and another for the person <lb/>
            to make it appear in that light to others. A general often <lb/>
            employs false representations, as did Hannibal, when, being <lb/>
            hemmed in by Fabius, he tied faggots to the horns of oxen, <lb/>
            and set them on fire, and, driving the herd up the opposite <lb/>
            hills in the night, presented to the enemy the appearance of a <note type="footnote"> * The work is lost. Gryllus was the son of Xenophon, that was <lb/>

            written on Gryllus, even for the sake of pleasing his father. The <lb/>

            retiring army; but Hannibal merely deceived Fabius; he him­ <lb/>
            self knew very well what the reality was. SO. Theopompus, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmouian, when, on changing clothes with his wife, <lb/>
            he escaped from prison in the disguise of a woman, came to <lb/>
            no false conclusion concerning himself, though he conveyed a <lb/>
            false notion to his guards. So the orator, whenever he puts <lb/>
            what is false for what is true, knows that it is false, and that <lb/>
            he is stating it instead of truth; he adopts, therefore no false <lb/>
            conclusion himself, but merely misleads another. 21. Cicero, <lb/>
            when he threw a mist, as he boasts, over the eyes ofthe judges <lb/>
            in the cause of Cluentius, was not himself deprived of sight; <lb/>
            nor is a painter, when, by the power of his art, he makes us <lb/>
            fancy that some objects stand out in a picture, and others <lb/>
            recede, unaware that the objects are all on a flat surface./,</p>
          <p>22. But they allege also, that “ all arts have a certain de­ <lb/>
            finite end to which they are directed; but that in oratory there <lb/>
            is sometimes no end at all, and, at other times, the end which <lb/>
            is professed is not attained." They speak falsely, however, in <lb/>
            this respect likewise, for we have already shown, that oratory <lb/>
            has an end, and have stated what that end is, an end which <lb/>
            the true orator will always attain, for he will always speak <lb/>
            well. 23. The objection might, perhaps, hold good against <lb/>
            those who think that the end of oratory is to persuade, but my <lb/>
            orator and his art, as defined by me, do not depend upon the <lb/>
            result; he indeed who speaks directs his efforts towards vic­ <lb/>
            tory, but when he has spoken well, though he may not be <lb/>
            victorious, he has attained the full end of his art. 24. So a <lb/>
            pilot is desirous to gain the port with his vessel in safety, but <lb/>
            if he is carried away from it by a tempest, he will not be the <lb/>
            less a pilot, and will repeat the well-known saying, “ May I <lb/>
            but keep the helm right!"* 25. The physician makes the <lb/>
            health of the patient his object, but if, through the violence of <lb/>
            the disease, the intemperance of the sick person, or any other <lb/>
            circumstance, he does not effect his purpose, yet, if he has <note type="footnote"> * A proverbial expression, from the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθάν τὰν</foreign> vavv: a <lb/>
            portion of a prayer to Neptune : Grant, 0 Neptune, that I may guide <lb/>
            the ship right. Spalding refers to Cic. ad Q. Fr. i. 2; Ep. ad Div. xii. <lb/>
            25 ; Sen. Epist. 85 ; Aristid. in Rhod. 542 ed. Jebb; Stobæus. p. 577; <lb/>

            done everything according to rule, he has not lost sight of the <lb/>
            object of medicine. So it is the object of an orator to speak <lb/>
            well, for his art, as we shall soon show still more clearly, con­ <lb/>
            sists in the act, and not in the result. 26. That other allega­ <lb/>
            tion, which is frequently made, must accordingly be false also, <lb/>
            that an art knows when it has attained its end, but that oratory <lb/>
            does not know, for every speaker is aware when he has spoken <lb/>
            well.</p>
          <p>They also charge oratory with having recourse to vicious <lb/>
            means, which no true arts adopt, because it advances what is <lb/>
            false, and endeavours to excite the passions. 27. But neither <lb/>
            of those means is dishonourable, when it is used from a good <lb/>
            motive, and, consequently, cannot be vicious. To tell a false­ <lb/>
            hood is sometimes allowed, even to a wise man ;* and the <lb/>
            orator will be compelled to appeal to the feelings of the judges, <lb/>
            if they cannot otherwise be induced to favour the right side. <lb/>
            28. Unenlightened men sit as judges,! who must, at times, be <lb/>
            deceived, that they may not err in their decisions. If indeed <lb/>
            judges were wise men: if assemblies of the people, and every <lb/>
            sort of public council, consisted of wise men; if envy, favour, <lb/>
            prejudice, and false witnesses, had no influence, there would <lb/>
            be very little room for eloquence, which would be employed <lb/>
            almost wholly to give pleasure. 29. But as the minds of the <lb/>
            hearers waver, and truth is exposed to so many obstructions, <lb/>
            the orator must use artifice in his efforts, and adopt such means <lb/>
            as may promote his purpose, since he who has turned from the <lb/>
            right way cannot be brought back to it but by another turning,</p>
          <p>30. Some common sarcasms against oratory are drawn from <lb/>
            the charge, that orators speak on both sides of a question; <lb/>
            hence the remarks, that 44 no art contradicts itself but that <lb/>
            oratory contradicts itself;" that “ no art destroys what it has <lb/>
            itself done, but that this is the case with what oratory does <lb/>
            that " it teaches either what we ought to say, or what we <lb/>
            ought not to say, and that, in the one case, it cannot be an art. <lb/>
            because it teaches what is not to be said, and, in the other, it <lb/>
            cannot be an art, because, when it has taught what is to be <lb/>
            said, it teaches also what is directly opposed to it." 31. All <note type="footnote"> Cic. Off. ii. 14, 16, 17. </note><note type="footnote"> t The reader will remember that the judice. of the Romans were <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            these charges, it is evident, are applicable only to that species <lb/>
            of oratory which is repudiated by a good man and by virtue <lb/>
            herself; since, where the cause is unjust, there true oratory <lb/>
            has no place, so that it can hardly happen, even in the most <lb/>
            extraordinary'case, that a real orator, that is, a good man, will <lb/>
            speak on 'loth sides. 32. Yet, since it may happen, in the <lb/>
            course of Things, that just causes may, at times, lead two wise <lb/>
            men to take different sides, (for the Stoics think that wise men <lb/>
            may even contend with one another, if reason leads them <lb/>
            to do so,*) I will make some reply to the objections, and <lb/>
            in such a way that they shall be proved to be advanced <lb/>
            groundlessly, and directed only against such as allow the <lb/>
            name of orator to speakers of bad character. 33. For <lb/>
            oratory does not contradict itself; one cause is matched against <lb/>
            another cause, but not oratory against itself. If two men, <lb/>
            who have been taught the same accomplishment, contend <lb/>
            with one another, the accomplishment which they have been <lb/>
            taught will not, on that account, be proved not to be an art; <lb/>
            for, if such were the case, there could be no art in arms, be­ <lb/>
            cause gladiators, bred under the same master, are often <lb/>
            matched together; nor would there be any art in piloting a <lb/>
            ship, because, in naval engagements, pilot is often opposed to <lb/>
            pilot; nor in generalship, because general contends with <lb/>
            general. 34. Nor does oratory destroy what it has done, for <lb/>
            the orator does not overthrow the argument advanced by him­ <lb/>
            self, nor does oratory overthrow it, because, by those who <lb/>
            think that the end of oratory is to persuade, as well as by the <lb/>
            two wise men, whom, as I said before, some chance may have <lb/>
            opposed to one another, it is probability that is sought; and <lb/>
            if, of two things, one at length appears more probable than <lb/>
            the other, the more probable is not opposed to that which pre­ <lb/>
            viously appeared probable; for as that which is more white is <lb/>
            not adverse to that which is less white, nor that which is more <lb/>
            sweet contrary to that which is less sweet, so neither is that <lb/>
            which is more probable contrary to that which is less probable. <lb/>
            35. Nor does oratory ever teach what we ought not to say, or <note type="footnote"> * The Stoics were compelled to hold this opinion, for they said that <lb/>
            to govern a state was the business of a wise man, and yet could not <lb/>
            venture to affirm that a wise man was to be found in any particular <lb/>
            state only. I cannot at this moment, however, find any passage among <lb/>

            that which is contrary to what we ought to say, but that which <lb/>
            we ought to say in whatever cause we may take in hand. 36. <lb/>
            And truth, though generally, is not always to be defended; <lb/>
            the public good sometimes requires that a falsehood should be <lb/>
            supported..</p>
          <p>In Cicero's second book De Oratore,† are also advanced <lb/>
            the following objections: that art has place in things which <lb/>
            are known, but that the pleading of an orator depends on <lb/>
            opinion, not on knowledge, since he both addresses himself to <lb/>
            those who do not know, and sometimes says what he himself <lb/>
            does not know. 37. One of these points, whether the judges <lb/>
            have a knowledge of what is addressed to them, has nothing <lb/>
            o do with the art of the orator; to the other, that art has <lb/>
            place in things which are known, I must give some answer. <lb/>
            Oratory is the art of speaking well, and the orator knows how <lb/>
            to speak well. 38. But it is said, he does not know whether <lb/>
            what he says is true; neither do the philosophers, who say <lb/>
            that fire, or water, or the four elements, or indivisible atoms, <lb/>
            are the principles from which all things had their origin <lb/>
            know that what they say is true; nor do those who calculate <lb/>
            the distances of the stars, and the magnitudes of the sun and <lb/>
            the earth, yet every one of them calls his system an art;§ <lb/>
            but if their reasoning has such effect that they seem not to <lb/>
            imagine, but, from the force of their demonstrations, to know <lb/>
            what they assert, similar reasoning may have a similar effect <lb/>
            in the case of the orator. 39. But, it is further urged, he does <lb/>
            not know whether the cause which he advocates has truth on <lb/>
            its side; nor, I answer, does the physician know whether the <lb/>
            patient, who says that he has the head-ache, really has it, yet <lb/>
            he will treat him on the assumption that his assertion is true, <lb/>
            and medicine will surely be allowed to be an art. Need I aid, <lb/>
            that oratory does not always purpose to say what is true, but <lb/>
            does always purpose to say what is like truth ? but the orator <lb/>
            must know whether what he says is like truth or not. 40. <lb/>
            Those who are unfavourable to oratory add, that pleaders often <lb/>
            defend, in certain causes, that which they have assailed in <lb/>
            others; but this is the fault, not of the art, but of the parson. <note type="footnote"> * Compare c. 7, sect. 27, and sect. 27—29 of this chapter. </note><note type="footnote"> t C. 7.

            These are the principal charges that are brought against <lb/>
            oratory. There are others of less moment, but drawn from <lb/>
            the same sources.</p>
          <p>41. But that it is an art, may be proved in a very few <lb/>
            words; for whether, as Cleanthes maintained, an art is a <lb/>
            power working its effects by a course, that is by method, no man <lb/>
            will doubt that there is a certain course and method in <lb/>
            oratory; or whether that definition, approved by almost every­ <lb/>
            body, that an art consists of perceptions* consenting and co­ <lb/>
            operating to some end useful to life, be adopted also by us, we <lb/>
            have already shown that everything to which this definition <lb/>
            applies is to be found in oratory. 42. Need I show that it <lb/>
            depends on understanding and practice, like other arts? If <lb/>
            logic be an art, as is generally admitted, oratory must certainly <lb/>
            be an art, as it differs from logic rather in species than in <lb/>
            genus. Nor must we omit to observe that in whatever pursuit <lb/>
            one man may act according to a method, and another without <lb/>
            regard to that method, that pursuit is an art; and that in <lb/>
            whatever pursuit he who has learned succeeds better than he <lb/>
            who has not learned, that pursuit is an art.</p>
          <p>43. But, in the pursuit of oratory, not only will the learned <lb/>
            excel the unlearned, but the more learned will excel the less <lb/>
            learned; otherwise there would not be so many rules in it, <lb/>
            or so many great men to teach it. This ought to be acknow­ <lb/>
            edged by every one, and especially by me, who allow the <lb/>
            attainment of oratory only to the man of virtue.</p>

          <p>Arts or sciences are of three kinds; rhetoric is a practical art ot <lb/>
            science, § 1, 2. Partakes of the nature of arts of other kinds, 3—5.</p>
          <p>1. BUT as some arts consist merely in an insight into things, <lb/>
            that is, knowledge of them, and judgment concerning them, <lb/>
            such as astronomy, which requires no act, but is confined to <lb/>
            a mere understanding of the matters that form the subject <note type="footnote"> * Perceptionum.] From the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταλήψεις</foreign>, signifying "things <lb/>
            thoroughly comprehended and understood." </note> <pb n="160"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II </note> <lb/>
            of it (a sort of art which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωϱητιϰή</foreign>, "theoretic'*); <lb/>
            others in action, the object of which lies in the act, and is <lb/>
            fulfilled in it, leaving nothing produced from it (a sort of art <lb/>
            which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱαϰτιϰή</foreign>, "practic "). as dancing; 2. others in <lb/>
            production, which attain their end in the execution of the <lb/>
            work which is submitted to the eye (a sort which we call <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιητιϰή</foreign>, " productive"), as painting, we may pretty safely <lb/>
            determine that oratory consists in act, for it accomplishes in <lb/>
            the act all that it has to do. Such indeed has been the judg­ <lb/>
            ment pronounced upon it by every one.</p>
          <p>3. To me, however, it appears to partake greatly of the other <lb/>
            sort of arts; for the subject of it may sometimes be restricted <lb/>
            to contemplation ; since there will be oratory in an orator even <lb/>
            though he be silent; and if, either designedly, or from being <lb/>
            disabled by any accident, he has ceased to plead, he will not <lb/>
            cease to be an orator, more than a physician who has left off prac­ <lb/>
            tice ceases to a physician. 4. There is some enjoyment, and <lb/>
            perhaps the greatest of all enjoyments, in retired meditation , <lb/>
            and the pleasure derived from knowledge is pure when it is <lb/>
            withdrawn from action, that is, from toil, and enjoys the calm <lb/>
            contemplation of itself. 5. But oratory will also effect some­ <lb/>
            thing similar to a productive art in written speeches and histo­ <lb/>
            rical compositions, a kind of writings which we justly consider <lb/>
            as allied to oratory. Yet if it must be classed as one of the <lb/>
            three sorts of arts which I have mentioned, let it, as its per­ <lb/>
            formance consists chiefly in the mere act, and as it is most <lb/>
            frequently exhibited in act, be called an active, or a practical <lb/>
            art, for the one term is of the same signification as the other.</p>

          <p>Nature and art; nature contributes more to oratory, in students of <lb/>
            moderate ability, than art; in those of greater talent, art is of more <lb/>
            avail; an example.</p>
          <p>1. I AM aware that it is also a question whether nature or <lb/>
            learning contributes most to oratory. This inquiry, however, <note type="footnote"> * Such artes we call " sciences." The term art we distinguish from <lb/>
            science by applying it only to that which produces something, as <lb/>
            painting, architecture. </note> <pb n="161"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.XIX ] </note> <lb/>
            has no concern with the subject of my work; for a perfect <lb/>
            orator can be formed only with the aid of both; but I think it <lb/>
            of great importance how far we consider that there is a ques <lb/>
            tion* on the point. 2. If you suppose either to be independent <lb/>
            of the other, nature will be able to do much without learning, <lb/>
            but learning will be of no avail without the assistance of <lb/>
            nature. But if they be united in equal parts, I shall be <lb/>
            inclined to think that, when both are but moderate, the influ­ <lb/>
            ence of nature is nevertheless the greater; but finished orators, <lb/>
            I consider, owe more to learning than to nature. Thus the best <lb/>
            husbandman cannot improve soil of no fertility, while from fertile <lb/>
            ground something good will be produced even without the aid of <lb/>
            the husbandman; yet if the husbandman bestows his labour on <lb/>
            rich land, he will produce more effect than the goodness of the <lb/>
            soil of itself. 3. Had Praxiteles attempted to hew a statue out <lb/>
            of a millstone, I should have preferred to it an unhewn block <lb/>
            of Parian marble; t but if that statuary had fashioned the <lb/>
            marble, more value would have accrued to it from his work­ <lb/>
            manship than was in the marble itself. In a word, nature is <lb/>
            the material for learning; the one forms, and the other is <lb/>
            formed. Art can do nothing without material; material has <lb/>
            its value even independent of art; but perfection of art is or <lb/>
            more consequence than perfection of material.</p>

          <p>Whether rhetoric be a virtue, as some call it, § 1—4. Proofs of this, <lb/>
            according to the philosophers, 5—7. Other proofs, 8—10.</p>
          <p>1. IT is a question of a higher nature, whether oratory is to <lb/>
            be regarded as one of those indifferent arts, which deserve <lb/>
            neither praise nor blame in themselves, but become useful or <note type="footnote"> * Quam—quæstionem.] This is obscurely expressed, says Spalding; <lb/>
            but quam is equivalent to qualem, quàm late comprehensam. </note><note type="footnote"> t The lover of art will hardly agree with Quintilian. Spalding. <lb/>
            But, as Rollin observes, nothing could have been less suitable for <lb/>
            sculpture than the stone used for millstones ; and Quintilian might <lb/>
            suppose that it would have been impossible, even for a Praxiteles, to <lb/>
            have produced even a tolerable statue from it. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.II. </note> <lb/>
            otherwise according to the characters of those who practise <lb/>
            them; or whether it is, as many of the philosophers are of <lb/>
            opinion, a positive virtue.*</p>
          <p>2. The way, indeed, in which many have proceeded and still <lb/>
            proceed in the practice of speaking, I consider either as no art, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτεχνία</foreign>, as it is called, (for I see numbers rushing to speak <lb/>
            without rule or learning, just as impudence or hunger has <lb/>
            prompted them,) or as it were a bad art, which we term <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαϰοτεχνία</foreign>; for I imagine that there have been many who <lb/>
            have exerted, and that there are some who still exert, their <lb/>
            talent in speaking to the injury of mankind. 3. There is also <lb/>
            a kind of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ματαιοτεχνία</foreign>, a vain imitation of art, which indeed <lb/>
            has in itself neither good nor evil, but a mere frivolous exer­ <lb/>
            cise of skill, such as that of the man who sent grains of vetches, <lb/>
            shot from a distance in succession, and without missing, <lb/>
            through a needle, and whom Alexander, after witnessing his <lb/>
            dexterity, is said to have presented with a bushel of vetches; <lb/>
            which was indeed a most suitable reward for his performance.!</p>
          <p>4. To him I compare those who spend their time, with great <lb/>
            study and labour, in the composition of declamations, which <lb/>
            they strive to make as unlike as possible to anything that <lb/>
            happens in real life.</p>
          <p>But that oratory which I endeavour to teach, of which I con <lb/>
            ceive the idea in my mind, which is attainable only by a good <lb/>
            man, and which alone is true oratory, must be regarded as a virtue. <note type="footnote"> * See note on c. 15, sect. 20. " Virtues are distinguished by Aria­ <lb/>
            totle into two kinds, the intellectual, which are exerted in the discovery <lb/>
            of truth and the accomplishment of our objects, under which head <lb/>
            oratory may be included, as it is an art; and the moral, which influence <lb/>
            the will, actions, and conduct, under which head Quintilian shows that <lb/>
            oratory may also be ranked as a virtue. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> t It has been a question what sort of performance we should <lb/>
            conceive this man's to have been. Naudæus, or Naudé, in his Syn­ <lb/>
            tagma de Studio Liberali, cited by Bayle, Art. Macedonia, note S, says <lb/>
            that the man put a pea in his mouth, and, blowing it out, made it stick <lb/>
            upon the point of the needle. This interpretation is adopted by Bayle, <lb/>
            and by Spalding; by Bayle with the utmost confidence, and by <lb/>
            Spalding with some hesitation, for he admits that the verb interere is <lb/>
            hardly applicable to the fixing of peas on the point of a needle. For <lb/>
            my part, I consider that the expression inserere in acum wholly forbids <lb/>
            us to understand anything else than that the peas were driven through <lb/>
            the needle's eye. We may suppose it to have been a peculiar needle, <lb/>
            with a large eye, made for the purpose. How the peas were impelled, <lb/>
            Quintilian leaves us to conjecture. </note> <pb n="163"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XX.] </note> <lb/>
            5. This is an opinion which the philosophers support by many <lb/>
            subtle arguments, but which appears to me to be more clearly <lb/>
            established by the simpler mode of proof which follows, and <lb/>
            which is peculiarly my own. What is said by the philosophers <lb/>
            is this : If it is a quality of virtue to be consistent with itself <lb/>
            as to what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, <lb/>
            (that quality, namely, which is called prudence,) the same <lb/>
            quality will have its office as to what ought to be said or not to <lb/>
            be said. 6. And if there are virtues, for the generation of <lb/>
            which, even before we receive any instruction, certain princi­ <lb/>
            ples and seeds are given us by nature,. (as for that of justice, <lb/>
            of which some notion is manifested even in the most ignorant <lb/>
            and the most barbarous,) it is evident that we are so formed <lb/>
            originally as to be able to speak for ourselves, though not <lb/>
            indeed perfectly, yet in such a manner as to show that cer­ <lb/>
            tain seeds of the faculty of eloquence are in us. 7. But in <lb/>
            those arts which have no connexion with virtue, there is not <lb/>
            the same nature.t As there are two kinds of speech, there­ <lb/>
            fore, the continuous, which is called oratory, and the concise, <lb/>
            which is termed logic, (which Zeno thought so nearly connected <lb/>
            that he compared the one to a clenched fist, and the other to <lb/>
            an open hand,) if the art of disputation t be a virtue, there will <lb/>
            be no doubt of the virtue of that which is of so much more <lb/>
            noble and expansive a nature.</p>
          <p>But I wish the reader to understand this more fully and <lb/>
            plainly from what is done by oratory; for how will an orator <lb/>
            succeed in eulogy, unless he has a clear knowledge of what is <lb/>
            honourable and what is disgraceful ? Or in persuasion, unless <lb/>
            he understands what is advantageous ? Or in judicial pleadings, <lb/>
            unless he has a knowledge of justice? Does not oratory also de­ <lb/>
            mand fortitude, as the orator has often to speak in opposition to <lb/>
            the turbulent threats of the populace, often with perilous defiance <lb/>
            of powerful individuals, and sometimes, as on the trial of Milo, <note type="footnote"> * The Stoics and Academics said that the seeds of virtues were <lb/>
            innate in us, and that, if we would but suffer them to grow, they <lb/>
            would secure us a happy life. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> t I wish that he had given an illustration of this position. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Ars disputatrix.] That is, dialectics or logic. If mere dry logic <lb/>
            be a virtue, how much more will rich and forcible eloquence be a <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B II. </note> <lb/>
            amidst surrounding weapons of soldiers ? So that if oratory be <lb/>
            not a virtue, it cannot be perfect.*</p>
          <p>9. If, moreover, there is a sort of virtue in every species of <lb/>
            animals, in which it excels the rest, or the greater number, of <lb/>
            other animals, as force in the lion, and swiftness in the <lb/>
            horse, and it is certain that man excels other animals in reason <lb/>
            and speech, why should we not consider that the distinctive <lb/>
            virtue of man lies as much in eloquence as in reason ? <lb/>
            Crassus in Cicerot justly makes an assertion to this effect: <lb/>
            " For eloquence," says he, " is one of the most eminent vir­ <lb/>
            tues and Cicero himself, in his own character, both in his <lb/>
            epistles to Brutus,‡ and in many other passages of his writings,§ <lb/>
            calls eloquence a virtue.</p>
          <p>10. But, it may be alleged, a vicious man will sometimes pro­ <lb/>
            duce an exordium, a statement of facts, and a series of argu­ <lb/>
            ments, in such a way that nothing shall be desired in them. <lb/>
            So, we may answer, a robber will fight with great bravery, yet <lb/>
            fortitude will still be a virtue; and a dishonest slave will bear <lb/>
            torments without a groan, yet endurance of pain will still merit <lb/>
            its praise. Many other things of the same nature occur, but <lb/>
            from different principles of action. Let what I have said, <lb/>
            therefore, as to eloquence being a virtue, be sufficient, for of <lb/>
            its usefulness I have treated above. <note type="footnote"> * On the contrary, if oratory be perfect oratory, it must necessarily <lb/>

          <p>Orinions as to the subject of rhetoric, § 1—4. That of Quintilian, <lb/>
            which agrees with those of Plato and Cicero, 5, 6. Objections to <lb/>

            about their respective subjects, 12, 13. The orator not obliged to <lb/>

            the artists themselves, 16—19. The opinion of Quintilian sup­ <lb/>
            ported by those of other authors, 20—23.</p>
          <p>1. As to the material of oratory, some have said that it is <lb/>
            speech; an opinion which Gorgias in Plato* is represented as <lb/>
            holding. If this be understood in such a way that a discourse, <lb/>
            composed on any subject, is to be termed a speech, it is <lb/>
            not the material, but the work ; as the statue is the work of a <lb/>
            statuary; for speeches, like statues, are produced by art. But <lb/>
            if by this term we understand mere words, words are of no <lb/>
            effect without matter. 2. Some have said that the material <lb/>
            of oratory is persuasive arguments; which indeed are part of <lb/>
            its business, and are the produce of art, but require material <lb/>
            for their composition. Others say that its material is ques­ <lb/>
            tions of civil administration; an opinion which is wrong, not <lb/>
            as to the quality of the matter, but in the restriction attached ; <lb/>
            for such questions are the subject of oratory, but not the only <lb/>
            subject. 3. Some, as oratory is a virtue, say that the subject <lb/>
            of it is the whole of human life. Others, as no part of human <lb/>
            life is affected by every virtue, but most virtues are concerned <lb/>
            only with particular portions of life, (as justice, fortitude, <lb/>
            temperance, are regarded as confined to their proper duties <lb/>
            and their own limits,) say that oratory is to be restricted to <lb/>
            one special part, and assign to it the pragmatic department of <lb/>
            ethics, or that which relates to the transactions of civil life.†</p>
          <p>4. For my part, I consider, and not without authorities to <lb/>
            support me, that the material of oratory is everything that <lb/>
            may come before an orator for discussion. For Socrates in <lb/>
            Plato seems to say to Gorgias* that the matter of oratory is <note type="footnote"> * Plato Gorg. p. 449 E. </note><note type="footnote"> t Eique locwm in ethice negotialem assignamt, id est, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πραγματτικόν</foreign>.] <lb/>
            By pars negotialis he means that which relates to law proceedings, civil <lb/>
            and judicial causes. Turnebus. Or that which relates to the acts of <lb/>
            civil life, or the conduct of affairs in general. Capperonier. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Gorg. p. 449—454. </note> <pb n="166"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. It </note> <lb/>
            not in words but in things. In the Phædrus * he plainly shows <lb/>
            that oratory has place, not only in judicial proceedings and <lb/>
            political deliberations, but also in private and domestic mat­ <lb/>
            ters. Hence it is manifest that this was the opinion of Plato <lb/>
            himself, † 5. Cicero, 000, in one passage,‡ calls the material <lb/>
            of oratory the topics which are submitted to it for discussion, <lb/>
            but supposes that particular topics only are submitted to it. <lb/>
            But in another passage § he gives his opinion that an orator <lb/>
            has to speak upon all subjects, expressing himself in the <lb/>
            following words: "The art of the orator, however, and his <lb/>
            very profession of speaking well, seems to undertake and <lb/>
            promise that he will speak elegantly and copiously on what­ <lb/>
            ever subject may be proposed to him." 6. In a third passage,|| <lb/>
            also, he says: " But by an orator, whatever occurs in human <lb/>
            life (since it is on human life that an orator's attention is to <lb/>
            be fixed, as the matter that comes under his consideration) <lb/>
            ought to have been examined, heard of, read, discussed, <lb/>
            handled, and managed."</p>
          <p>7. But this material of oratory, as we define it, that is, the <lb/>
            subjects that come before it, some have at one time stigmatized <lb/>
            as indefinite,1f at another as not belonging to oratory, and have <lb/>
            called it, as thus characterised, an ars circumcurrens, an infinitely <lb/>
            discursive art, as discoursing on any kind of subject. 8. With <lb/>
            such as make these observations I have no great quarrel; for <lb/>
            they allow that oratory speaks on all matters, though they deny <lb/>
            that it has any pecular material, because its material is manifold. <lb/>
            9. But though the material be manifold, it is not infinite; and <lb/>
            other arts, of less consideration, deal with manifold material, <lb/>
            as architecture, for instance, for it has to do with everything <lb/>
            that is of use for building; and the art of engraving, which <lb/>
            works with gold, silver, brass, and iron. As to sculpture, it <lb/>
            extends itself, besides the metals which I have just named, <lb/>
            to wood, ivory, marble, glass, and jewels. 10. Nor will a topic <lb/>
            cease to belong to the orator because the professor of another <lb/>
            art may treat of it; for if I should ask what is the material of <note type="footnote">* P. 261 A. </note><note type="footnote"> t As being put into the mouth of Socrates. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ De Orat. i. 15; Inv, i. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> § De Orate i. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> || De Orate iii. 14. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ Infinitam.] Indefinite, indeterminate; because it represents oratory <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. XXI.] </note> <lb/>
            the statuary, the answer will be "brass;" or if I should ask <lb/>
            what is the material of the founder of vases, that is the worker <lb/>
            in the art which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλϰευτιϰή</foreign>, the reply would <lb/>
            also be " brass;" though vases differ very much from statues. <lb/>
            11. Nor ought medicine to lose the name of an art, because <lb/>
            anointing and exercise are common to it with the palæstra, or <lb/>
            because a knowledge of the quality of meats is common to it <lb/>
            with cookery.</p>
          <p>12. As to the objection which some make, that it is the <lb/>
            business of philosophy to discourse of what is good, useful, <lb/>
            and just, it makes nothing against me; for when they say a <lb/>
            philosopher, they mean a good man; and why then should I <lb/>
            be surprised that an orator, whom I consider to be also a good <lb/>
            man, should discourse upon the same subjects? 13. especially <lb/>
            when I have shown, in the preceding book,. that philosophers <lb/>
            have taken possession of this province because it was aban­ <lb/>
            doned by the orators, a province which had always belonged <lb/>
            to oratory, so that the philosophers are rather trespassing <lb/>
            upon our ground. Since it is the business of logic, too, to dis­ <lb/>
            cuss whatever comes before it, and logic is uncontinuous ora­ <lb/>
            tory, why may not the business of continuous oratory be <lb/>
            thought the same ?</p>
          <p>14. It is a remark constantly made by some, that an orator <lb/>
            must be skilled in all arts if he is to speak upon all subjects. I <lb/>
            might reply to this in the words of Cicero,! in whom I find <lb/>
            this passage: " In my opinion no man can become a thoroughly <lb/>
            accomplished orator, unless he shall have attained a knowledge <lb/>
            of every subject of importance, and of all the liberal arts;" but <lb/>
            for my argument it is sufficient that an orator be acquainted <lb/>
            with the subject on which he has to speak. 15. He has not <lb/>
            a knowledge of all causes, and yet he ought to be able to speak <lb/>
            upon all. On what causes, then, will he speak ? on such as he <lb/>
            has learned. The same will be the case also with regard to <lb/>
            the arts and sciences; those on which he shall have to speak <lb/>
            he will study for the occasion, and on those which be has <lb/>
            studied he will speak.</p>
          <p>16. What then, it may be said, will not a builder speak of <lb/>
            building, or a musician of music, better than an orator ? As­ <lb/>
            suredly he will speak better, if the orator does not know what <lb/>
            is the subject of inquiry in the case before him, with regard to <note type="footnote"> * Proœm. sect. 10 seqc. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Do Orat L 6. </note> <pb n="168"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.n. </note> <lb/>
            matters connected with those sciences. An ignorant and <lb/>
            illiterate person, appearing before a court, will plead his own <lb/>
            cause better than an orator who does not know what the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of dispute is; but an orator will express what he has <lb/>
            learned from the builder, or the musician, or from his client, <lb/>
            better than the person who has instructed him. 17. But the <lb/>
            builder will speak well on building, or the musician on music, <lb/>
            if any point in those arts shall require to be established by his <lb/>
            opinion; he will not be an orator, but he will perform his part <lb/>
            like an orator, as when an unprofessional person binds up a <lb/>
            wound, he will not be a surgeon, yet he will act as a surgeon.</p>
          <p>18. Do subjects of this kind never come to be mentioned in <lb/>
            panegyrical, or deliberative, or judicial oratory ? When it was <lb/>
            under deliberation, whether a harbour should be constructed <lb/>
            at Ostia,* were not orators called to deliver opinions on the <lb/>
            subject ? yet what was wanted was the professional knowledge <lb/>
            of the architect. 19. Does not the orator enter on the ques­ <lb/>
            tion, whether discolorations and tumours of the body are <lb/>
            symptoms of ill health or of poison?† yet such inquiries be­ <lb/>
            long to the profession of medicine? Will an orator never <lb/>
            have to speak of dimensions and numbers ? yet we may say <lb/>
            that such matters belong to mathematics; for my part, I <lb/>
            believe that any subject whatever may, by some chance, come <lb/>
            under the cognizance of the orator. If a matter does not come <lb/>
            under his cognizance, he will have no concern with it.</p>
          <p>20. Thus I have justly said, that the material of oratory is <lb/>
            everything that is brought under its notice for discussion, an <lb/>
            assertion which even our daily conversation supports, for <lb/>
            whenever we have any subject on which to speak, we often <lb/>
            signify by some prefatory remark, that the matter is laid <lb/>
            before us. 21. So much was Gorgias ‡ of opinion that an <lb/>
            orator must speak of everything, that he allowed himself to be <lb/>
            questioned by the people in his lecture-room, upon any sub­ <lb/>
            ject on which any one of them chose to interrogate him. <lb/>
            Hermagoras also, by saying, that " the matter of oratory lies <note type="footnote"> * See Suet. Claud. c. 20, where it is stated that the work had often <lb/>
            been contemplated by Julius Cæsar, but deferred from time to time on <lb/>

            in the cause and the questions * connected with it," compre <lb/>
            bends under it every subject that can possibly come before it <lb/>
            for discussion. 22. If indeed he supposed that the questions <lb/>
            do not belong to oratory, he is of a different opinion from me; <lb/>
            but if they do belong to oratory, I am supported by his <lb/>
            authority, for there is no subject that may not form part of a <lb/>
            cause or the questions connected with it. 23. Aristotle,! too, <lb/>
            by making three kinds of oratory, the judicial, the deliberative, <lb/>
            and the demonstrative, has put almost everything into the <lb/>
            hands of the orator, for there is no subject that may not enter <lb/>
            into one of the three kinds.</p>
          <p>24. An inquiry has been also started, though by a very few <lb/>
            writers, concerning the instrument of oratory. The instrument <lb/>
            I call that without which material cannot be fashioned and <lb/>
            adapted to the object which we wish to effect. But I consider <lb/>
            that it is not the art that requires the instrument, but the <lb/>
            artificer. Professional knowledge needs no tool, as it may be <lb/>
            complete though it produces nothing, but the artist must have <lb/>
            his tool, as the engraver his graving-instrument, and the <lb/>
            painter his pencils. I shall therefore reserve the consideration <lb/>
            of this point for that part of my work in which I intend to <lb/>
            speak of the orator. ‡ <note type="footnote"> * See iii. 5, 16 ; iii. 6, 2. The questions meant are general questions, <lb/>

          <p>Quintilian proposes to consider the various branches and precepts of <lb/>
            oratory more fully than they are generally set forth in treatises on <lb/>
            the art; a part of his work more desirable for students than <lb/>

            occur, 22.</p>
          <p>1. Since I have examined in the second book what oratory <lb/>
            is, und what is its object; since I have shown, as well as my <lb/>
            abilities allowed, that it is an art,* that it is useful,‡ and that <lb/>
            it is a virtue ;‡ and since I have put under its power every <lb/>
            subject § on which it may be necessary to speak, I shall now pro­ <lb/>
            ceed to show whence it had its origin,|| of what parts it consists,¶ <lb/>
            and how every department of it is to be contemplated.. and <lb/>
            treated; for most of the writers of books on the art have <lb/>
            stopped even short of these limits ;tt so that Apollodorus‡‡ <lb/>
            confined himself to judicial pleadings only.</p>
          <p>2. Nor am I ignorant that those who are studious of oratory <lb/>
            have desired to receive from me that part of my work, of which <lb/>
            this book proceeds to treat, more anxiously than any other; a <lb/>
            part which, though it will be the most difficult to myself, from <lb/>
            the necessity of examining a vast diversity of opinions, wil. <lb/>
            yet perhaps afford the least pleasure to mv readers, since it <note type="footnote"> * B ii. c.

            <note type="margin"> CH. I.] </note> <lb/>
            admits merely of a dry exposition of rules. 3. In other parts <lb/>
            I have endeavoured to introduce some little embellishment, <lb/>
            not with the view of displaying my own ability, (since for that <lb/>
            purpose a subject of more fertility might have been chosen,) but <lb/>
            in order that, by that means, I might more successfully attract <lb/>
            youth to the study of those matters which I thought necessary <lb/>
            for their improvement; if, possibly, being stimulated by some <lb/>
            pleasure in the reading, they might more willingly learn those <lb/>
            precepts of which I found that a bare and dry enumeration <lb/>
            might be repulsive to their minds, and offend their ears, <lb/>
            especially as they are grown so delicate. 4. It was with such <lb/>
            a view that Lucretius * said he put the precepts of philosophy <lb/>
            into verse; for he uses, as is well known, the following <lb/>
            simile <lb/>
            Ac veluti pueris absinthia tetra medentes <lb/>
            Quum dare conantur, prius oras pocula circum <lb/>
            Aspirant mellis dulci flavoque liquore : <lb/>
            " And as physicians, when they attempt to give bitter worm­ <lb/>
            wood to children, first tinge the rim round the cup with the <lb/>
            sweet and yellow liquid of honey," &amp;c. 5. But I fear that <lb/>
            this book may be thought to contain very little honey and a <lb/>
            great deal of wormwood, and may be more serviceable for <lb/>
            instruction than agreeable. I am afraid, too, that it may find <lb/>
            the less favour, as it will contain precepts not newly in­ <lb/>
            vented, for the most part, by me, but previously given by <lb/>
            others; and it may also meet with some who are of contrary <lb/>
            opinions, and who will be ready to assail it; because most <lb/>
            authors, though they have directed their steps to the same <lb/>
            point, have made different roads towards it, and each has <lb/>
            drawn his followers into his own. 6. Their adherents, more­ <lb/>
            over, approve whatever path they have pursued, and you will <lb/>
            not easily alter prepossessions that have been inculcated into <lb/>
            youth, for every one had rather have learned than learn.</p>
          <p>7. But there is, as will appear in the progress of the book, <lb/>
            an infinite diversity of opinions among authors; as some have <note type="footnote"> * B. i. v. 934; iv. 11. In the first of these passages, however, we <lb/>
            find Sed, and in the second Nam, instead of Ac, and, instead of <lb/>
            aspirant, contingent. Such variations have led to the supposition that <lb/>
            there were two editions of Lucretius's poem; see Spalding's note, and <lb/>
            the " Remarks" prefixed to my translation of Lucretius, p, vii viii. <lb/>
            Spalding observes that " aspirare mellis liquore" will be equivalent to <lb/>
            " odore et sapore mellis imbuere." </note> <pb n="172"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.III. </note> <lb/>
            added their own discoveries to what was previously rude and <lb/>
            imperfect, and then others, that they might seem to produce <lb/>
            something themselves, have even altered what was right. 8. <lb/>
            The first writer who, after those that the poets have mentioned, <lb/>
            touched at all upon oratory, is said to have been Empedocles,* <lb/>
            and the most ancient composers of rules on the art were Corax <lb/>
            and Tisias,t natives of Sicily; to whom succeeded a native of <lb/>
            the same island, Gorgias the Leontine, who, as is said, was a <lb/>
            pupil of Empedocles. 9. Gorgias, through the advantage of <lb/>
            a very long life, (for he lived a hundred and nine years,) <lb/>
            flourished as a contemporary with many rhetoricians; and was <lb/>
            thus a rival of those whom I have just named, and survived <lb/>
            even the age of Socrates. 10. At the same period with him <lb/>
            lived Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, Prodicus of Coos, Prota­ <lb/>
            goras of Abdera, (from whom Euathlus is said to have learned <lb/>
            the art of oratory, on which he published a treatise, for ten <lb/>
            thousand denarii,t) Hippias of Elis, and Alcidamus of Elæa, <lb/>
            whom Plato calls Palamedes; 11. There was also Antiphon, <lb/>
            (who was the first that wrote speeches § and who, besides, <lb/>
            composed a book of rules on rhetoric, and was thought to have <lb/>
            pleaded his own cause on a trial with great ability,) Polycrates, <lb/>
            by whom I have said || that a speech was written against <lb/>
            Socrates, and Theodorus of Byzantium, one of those whom <lb/>
            Plate ¶ calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογοδαίδαλοι</foreign>, " artificers in words." 12. Of these, <lb/>
            the first that treated general subjects were Protagoras, Gor­ <lb/>
            gias, Prodicus, and Thrasymachus. Cicero, in his Brutus,** <lb/>
            says that no composition, having any rhetorical embellishment, <lb/>
            was written before the time of Pericles, but that some pieces <lb/>
            of his were in circulation. For my part, I find nothing <note type="footnote"> * Movisse aliqua circa rhetoricen Empedocles dicitur.] '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εμπεδοκλέα</foreign> A <lb/>

            most famous of the pupils of Gorgias was Isocrates; though <lb/>
            authors, indeed, are not agreed as to who was his master; I, <lb/>
            however, trust to Aristotle t on that point. 14. From this <lb/>
            time different roads, as it were, began to be formed; for the <lb/>
            disciples of Isocrates were eminent in every department of <lb/>
            learning; and, when he was grown old, (he lived to complete <lb/>
            his ninety-eighth year,) Aristotle began to teach the art of <lb/>
            oratory in his afternoon lessons,‡ frequently parodying, as is <lb/>
            said, the well-known verse from the tragedy of Philoctetes, <lb/>
            thus: <figure type="illustration">

               <lb/>
              " It is disgraceful to be silent, and to allow Isocrates to speak." <lb/>
              A treatise on the art of oratory was published by each of them; <note type="footnote"> * See xii. 2, 42 ; 10, 49; where Quintilian positively asserts that no <lb/>

              Crit. Or. Gr. p. 38, brings plenty of authorities to support that <lb/>
              assertion, though Cicero (Brut. c. 7, and de Orat. ii. 22) seems to have <lb/>
              had greater faith in the genuineness of the writings circulated under <lb/>
              the name of Pericles. Could the genuine writings of Pericles have been <lb/>

              same time lived Theodectes, of whose work I have already <lb/>
              spoken. 15. Theophrastus, also, a disciple of Aristotle, wrote <lb/>
              very carefully on rhetoric; and since that time the philoso­ <lb/>
              phers, especially the leaders of the Stoics and Peripatetics, <lb/>
              have paid even greater attention to the subject than the <lb/>
              rhetoricians. 16. Hermagoras then made, as it were, a way <lb/>
              for himself, which most orators have followed; but Athenæus* <lb/>
              appears to have been most nearly his equal and rival. After­ <lb/>
              wards Apollonius Molon, Areus,† Cæcilius, and Dionysius of <lb/>
              Halicarnassus, wrote much upon the art. IT. But the two <lb/>
              that attracted most attention to themselves were Apollodorus <lb/>
              of Pergamus, who was the teacher of Cæsar Augustus at Apol­ <lb/>
              lonia, and Theodorus of Gadara, who preferred to be called a <lb/>
              native of Rhodes, and whose lectures Tiberius Cæsar, when he <lb/>
              retired into that island, is said to have constantly attended. <lb/>
              18. These two rhetoricians taught different systems, and <lb/>
              their followers were thence called Apollodoreans and Theo­ <lb/>
              doreans,‡ after the manner of those who devote themselves to <lb/>
              certain sects in philosophy. But the doctrines of Apollodorus <lb/>

          <p>Of the origin of oratory, § 1, 2. Nature and art, 3. Objection to <lb/>
            Cicero'is notion, 4.</p>
          <p>1. THE question, what is the origin of oratory, need not <lb/>
            detain us long; for who can doubt that men, as soon as they <lb/>
            were produced, received language from nature herself, the <lb/>
            parent of all things, (which was at least the commencement of <lb/>
            oratory,) and that utility brought improvement to it, and <lb/>
            method and exercise perfection? 2. Nor do I see why some <lb/>
            should think that accuracy in speaking had its rise from the <lb/>
            circumstance that those, who were brought into any danger by <lb/>
            accusation, set themselves to speak with more than ordinary <lb/>
            care for the purpose of defending themselves.. This, even if <lb/>
            a more honourable cause, is not necessarily the first; especially <lb/>
            as accusation goes before defence; unless any person would <lb/>
            say that a sword was forged by one who prepared steel for his <lb/>
            own defence earlier than by one who designed it for the <lb/>
            destruction of another.</p>
          <p>It was therefore nature that gave origin to speech ; and <lb/>
            observation that gave origin to art; for as, in regard to medi <note type="footnote"> * I have not found in any writer an express assertion to this effect. <lb/>
            Spalding. </note> <pb n="177"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.III.] </note> <lb/>
            ciue, when people saw that some things were wholesome and <lb/>
            others unwholesome, they established an art by observing their <lb/>
            different properties, so, with respect to speaking, when they <lb/>
            found some things useful and others useless, they marked <lb/>
            them for imitation or avoidance; other people added other <lb/>
            things to the list according to their nature; these observations <lb/>
            were confirmed by experience; and every one then taught what <lb/>
            he knew. 4. Cicero,* indeed, has attributed the origin of­ <lb/>
            eloquence to founders of cities and to legislators; in whom <lb/>
            there certainly must have been some power of speaking; but <lb/>
            why he should regard this as the very origin of oratory, I do <lb/>
            not see; as there are nations at this day without any fixed <lb/>
            settlements, without cities, and without laws, and yet men <lb/>
            who are born among them discharge the duties of ambassadors, <lb/>
            make accusations and defences, and think that one person <lb/>
            speaks better than another.</p>

          <p>Divisions of the art of Oratory, § 1— 3. Various opinions respecting <lb/>
            them, 4, 5. Cicero's not always the same, 6, 7. Opinions of some <lb/>
            Greek writers, 8, 9. Of the order of the division or parts, 10. <lb/>
            Whether they should be called parts, or works, or elements, 11.</p>
          <p>1. THE whole art of oratory, as the most and greatest <lb/>
            writers have taught, consists of five parts, invention arrange- <lb/>
            merit, expression, memory, and delivery oraction; for the last <lb/>
            is designated by either of these terms. But every speech, by <lb/>
            which any purpose is expressed, must of necessity consist of <lb/>
            both matter and words; 2. and, if it is short, and included <lb/>
            in one sentence, it may perhaps call for no. further considera­ <lb/>
            tion ; but a speech of greater length requires attention to a <lb/>
            greater number of particulars; for it is not only of consequence <lb/>
            what we say, and how we say it, but also where we say it; <lb/>
            there is need therefore also for arrangement. But we cannot <lb/>
            say everything that our subject demands, nor everything in its <lb/>
            proper place, without the assistance of memory, which will <lb/>
            accordingly constitute a fourth part. 3. And a delivery which <lb/>
            is unbecoming either as to voice or gesture, vitiates, and <note type="footnote"> * De Orat. i. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            almost renders <unclear>ineffectual</unclear>,all those other requisites o <lb/>
            eloquence; and to delivery therefore must necessarily be <lb/>
            assigned the fifth place.</p>
          <p>4. Nor are some writers, among whom is Albutius,* to be <lb/>
            be regarded, who admit only the first three parts, because <lb/>
            memory, they say, and delivery, (on which we shall give <lb/>
            directions in the proper place,t) come from nature, not from <lb/>
            art. Thracymachus,‡ however, was of the same opinion as far <lb/>
            as concerns delivery. 6. To-these some have added a sixth <lb/>
            part, by subjoining judgment to invention, as it is our first <lb/>
            business to invent, and then to judge. For my part, I do not <lb/>
            consider that he who has not judged has invented; for a <lb/>
            person is not said to have invented contradictory or foolish <lb/>
            arguments, or such as are of equal value to himself and his <lb/>
            adversary, but not to have avoided them. 6. Cicero, indeed, <lb/>
            in his Rhetorica,§ has included judgment under invention; <lb/>
            but, to me, judgment appears to be so mingled with the first <lb/>
            three parts (for there can neither be arrangement nor expression <lb/>
            without it), that I think even delivery greatly indebted to it. <lb/>
            7. This I would the more boldly affirm, as Cicero, in his Par­ <lb/>
            titiones Oratoriæ,|| arrives at the same five divisions of which <lb/>
            I have just spoken ; for, after first dividing oratory into twc <lb/>
            parts, invention and expression, he has put matter and arrange <lb/>
            ment under invention, and words and delivery under expression, <lb/>
            and has then made memory a fifth part, having a common <lb/>
            influence on all the rest, and being, as it were, the guardian of <lb/>
            them. He also says, in his books de Oratore,¶ that eloquence <lb/>
            consists of five divisions; and the opinions expressed in these <note type="footnote"> * Albutius Novariensis came to Rome in the reign of Augustus, <lb/>

            after having previously specified arrangement,! as if arrange­ <lb/>
            ment were anything else than the disposition of things in the <lb/>
            best possible order. Dion‡ has specified only invention and <lb/>
            arrangement, but has made each of them of two kinds, <lb/>
            relating to matter and to words; so that expression may be <lb/>
            included under invention, and delivery under arrangement; <lb/>
            to which parts a fifth, memory, must be added. The followers <lb/>
            of Theodorus, for the most part, distinguish invention into two <lb/>
            sorts, referring to matter and expression; and then add the <lb/>
            three other parts. 9. Hermagoras puts judgment, division <lb/>
            order, and whatever relates to expression, under economy, <lb/>
            which, being -a Greek term, taken from the care of domestic <lb/>
            affairs, and used in reference to this subject metaphorically, <lb/>
            has no Latin equivalent.</p>
          <p>10. There is also a question about the following point, <lb/>
            namely, that, in settling the order of the parts, some have <lb/>
            put memory after invention, some after arrangement. To me <lb/>
            the fourth place seems most suitable for it; for we must not <lb/>
            only retain in mind what we have imagined, in order to arrange <lb/>
            it, and what we have arranged in order to express it, but we <lb/>
            must also commit to memory what we have comprised in <lb/>
            words; since it is in the memory that everything that enters <lb/>
            into the composition of a speech is deposited.</p>
          <p>11. There have been also many writers inclined to think <lb/>
            that these divisions should not be called parts of the art of <lb/>
            oratory but duties of the orator, as it is the business of the <lb/>
            orator to invent, arrange, express, et cetera. 12. But if we coin­ <lb/>
            cide in this opinion, we shall leave nothing to art; for to speak <lb/>
            well is the duty of the orator, yet skill in speaking well <lb/>
            constitutes the art of oratory; or, as others express their <lb/>
            notions, it is the duty of the orator to persuade, yet the power <lb/>
            of persuading lies in bis art. Thus to invent arguments and <note type="footnote"> * Not less than those who are mentioned in sect. 5 as having intra <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. III </note> <lb/>
            arrange them are the duties of the orator; yet invention and <lb/>
            arrangement may be thought peculiar parts of the art of oratory.</p>
          <p>13. It is a point, too, about which many have disputed, <lb/>
            whether these are parts of the art of oratory or works of it, <lb/>
            OI (as Athenæus* thinks) elements of it, which the Greeks <lb/>
            call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτοιχε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">α</foreign>. But no one can properly call them elements; for <lb/>
            in that case they will be merely first principles, as water, or fire, <lb/>
            or matter, or indivisible atoms, are called the elements of the <lb/>
            world ; nor can they justly be named works, as they are not <lb/>
            performed by others, but perform something themselves. <lb/>
            14. They are therefor art; for as oratory consists of them, <lb/>
            and as a whole consists of parts, it is impossible that those <lb/>
            things of which the whole is composed can be anything else but <lb/>
            parts of that whole. Those who have called them works, ap­ <lb/>
            pear to me to have been moved by this consideration, that they <lb/>
            did not like, in making the other division of oratory, to adopt <lb/>
            the same term; for the parts of oratory, they said, were the <lb/>
            panegyrical, the deliberative, and the judicial. 15. But if these <lb/>
            are parts, they are parts of the matter rather than the art; for <lb/>
            in each of them is included the whole of oratory; since no one <lb/>
            of them can dispense with invention, arrangement, expression, <lb/>
            memory, and delivery. Some, therefore, have thought it better <lb/>
            to say that there are three kinds of oratory; but those whom <lb/>
            Cicero t has followed have given the most reasonable opinion, <lb/>
            namely, that there are three kinds of subjects for oratory.</p>

          <p>Whether there are three sorts of oratory, or more, § 1—3. Quintilian <lb/>
            adheres to the old opinion that there are but three; his reasons, <lb/>

          <p>1. BUT it is a question whether there are three or more. <lb/>
            Certainly almost all writers, at least those of the highest <lb/>
            authority among the ancients, have acquiesced in this tripartite <lb/>
            distinction, following the opinion of Aristotle, who merely calls <note type="footnote"> * IL 15, 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t De Orate i. 31 ; Top. c. 24. </note> <pb n="181"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. TV.J </note> <lb/>
            the deliberative by another name, concionalis, * " suitable for <lb/>
            addresses to public assemblies." 2. But a feeble attempt was <lb/>
            made at that time by some of the Greek writers, an attempt <lb/>
            which has since been noticed by Cicero in his books De Oratore <lb/>
            and is now almost forced upon us by the greatest author! <lb/>
            of our own day, to make it appear that there are not only <lb/>
            more kinds, but kinds almost innumerable. 3. Indeed, <lb/>
            if we distinguish praising and blaming in the third part of <lb/>
            oratory, in what kind of oratory shall we be said to employ <lb/>
            ourselves when we complain, console, appease, excite, alarm, <lb/>
            encourage, direct, explain obscure expressions, narrate, entreat, <lb/>
            offer thanks, congratulate, reproach, attack, describe, command, <lb/>
            retract, express wishes or opinions, and speak in a thousand <lb/>
            other ways ? 4. So that if I adhere to the opinion of the <lb/>
            ancients, I must, as it were, ask pardon for doing so, and must <lb/>
            inquire by what considerations they were induced to confine a <lb/>
            subject of such extent and variety within such narrow limits ? <lb/>
            5 Those who say that the ancients were in error, suppose that <lb/>
            they were led into it by the circumstance that they saw in <lb/>
            their time orators exerting themselves for the most part in these <lb/>
            three kinds only; for laudatory and vituperative speeches were <lb/>
            then written ; it was customary to pronounce funeral orations; <lb/>
            and a vast deal of labour was bestowed on deliberative and <lb/>
            judicial eloquence; so that the writers of books on the art <lb/>
            included in them the kinds of eloquence most in use as the <lb/>
            only kinds. 6. But those who defend the ancients, make three <lb/>
            sorts of hearers; one, who assemble only to be gratified; a <lb/>
            second, to listen to counsel; and a third, to form a judgment <lb/>
            on the points in debate. For myself, while I am searching <lb/>
            for all sorts of arguments in support of these various opinions, <lb/>
            it occurs to me that we might make only two kinds of oratory, <lb/>
            on this consideration, that all the business of an orator lies in <lb/>
            causes either judicial or extrajudicial. 7. Of matters in which <lb/>
            decision is sought from the opinion of a judge, the nature is <lb/>
            self-evident; those which are not referred to a judge, have respect <lb/>
            either to the past or to the future; the past we either praise <lb/>
            or blame; and about the future we deliberate. 8. We may <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δημηγορικόν</foreign>. Arist.

            <note type="margin"> [B. in. </note> <lb/>
            also add, that all subjects on which an orator has to speak <lb/>
            are either certain or doubtful; the certain he praises or <lb/>
            blames, according to the opinion which he forms of them ; of <lb/>
            the doubtful, some are left free for ourselves to choose how to <lb/>
            decide on them, and concerning these there must be delibera­ <lb/>
            tion; some are left to the judgment of others, and concerning <lb/>
            these there must be litigation.</p>
          <p>9. Anaximenes admitted only the general divisions of ju­ <lb/>
            dicial and deliberative, but said that there were seven species; <lb/>
            those, namely, of exhorting and dissuading, of praising and <lb/>
            blaming, of accusing and defending, and of examining, which <lb/>
            he calls the exetastic sort; but it is easy to see that the first <lb/>
            two of these species belong to the deliberative kind of oratory, <lb/>
            the two following to the epideictic, and the last three to the <lb/>
            judicial. 10. I pass over Protagoras, who thinks that the <lb/>
            only parts of oratory are those of interrogating, replying, com­ <lb/>
            manding, and intreating, which he calls Plato, in his <lb/>
            Sophistes,* has added to the judicial and deliberative a third <lb/>
            kind which he calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱοϬομιλητιϰόν</foreign>, and which we may allow <lb/>
            ourselves to call the sermocinatory sort, which is distinct from <lb/>
            the oratory of the forum, and suited to private discussions, and <lb/>
            of which the nature is the same as that of dialectics or logic <lb/>
            11. Isocrates † thought that praise and blame have a place in <lb/>
            every kind of oratory.</p>
          <p>To me it has appeared safest to follow the majority of <lb/>
            writers; and so reason seems to direct. 12. There is, then, <lb/>
            as I said, one kind of oratory in which praise and blame are <lb/>
            included, but which is called, from the better part of its office, <lb/>
            the panegyrical; others, however, term it the demonstrative or <lb/>
            epideictic. (Both names are thought to be derived from the <lb/>
            Greeks, who apply to those kinds the epithets <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲγϰωμιαστιϰὸν</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιδειϰτιϰόν</foreign>. 13. But the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιδειϰτιϰὸν</foreign> seems to me <lb/>
            to have the signification, not so much of demonstration as of <lb/>
            ostentation, and to differ very much from the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγϰωμια­ <lb/>
            στιϰόν</foreign>; for though it includes in it the laudatory kind of oratory, <lb/>
            it does not consist in that kind alone. 14. Would any one <lb/>
            deny that panegyrical speeches are of the epideictic kind ? Yet <lb/>
            they take the suasory form, and generally speak of the interests <lb/>
            of Greece. So that there are, indeed, three kinds of oratory; <note type="footnote"> * Ed. Steph. p. 222. </note><note type="footnote"> t See ii. 15, 4. </note> <pb n="183"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.V.] </note> <lb/>
            but in each of them part is devoted to the subject-matter, and <lb/>
            part to display. But perhaps our countrymen, when they <lb/>
            call a particular kind demonstrative, do not borrow the name <lb/>
            from the Greeks, but are simply led by the consideration that <lb/>
            praise and blame demonstrate what the exact nature of any­ <lb/>
            thing is.) 15. The second kind is the deliberative, and the third <lb/>
            the judicial. Other species will fall under these genera, not <lb/>
            will there be found any one species in which we shall not have <lb/>
            either to praise or to blame, to persuade or to dissuade, to enforce <lb/>
            a charge or to repel one ; while to conciliate, to state facts, to <lb/>
            inform, to exaggerate, to extenuate, and to influence the judgment <lb/>
            of the audience by exciting or allaying the passions, are corn <lb/>
            mon to every sort of oratory.</p>
          <p>16. I could not agree even with those, who, adopting, as ] <lb/>
            think, a division rather easy and specious than true, consider <lb/>
            that the matter of panegyrical eloquence concerns what is <lb/>
            honourable, that of deliberative what is expedient, and that of <lb/>
            judicial what is just; for all are supported, to a certain extent, <lb/>
            by aid one from another ; since in panegyric justice and expe­ <lb/>
            diency are considered, and in deliberations honour; and you <lb/>
            will rarely find a judicial pleading into some part of which <lb/>
            something of what I have just mentioned does not enter.</p>

          <p>Division into things and words: other divisions, § 1—3. Questions <lb/>

          <p>1. BUT every speech consists at once of that which is ex­ <lb/>
            pressed, and of that which expresses, that is, of matter and <lb/>
            words. Ability in speaking is produced by nature, art, and <lb/>
            practice ; to which some add a fourth requisite, namely imita­ <lb/>
            tion; which I include under art. 2. There are also three <lb/>
            objects which an orator must accomplish, to inform, to move, <lb/>
            to please ; for this is a clearer partition than that of those who <lb/>
            divide the whole of oratory into what concerns things and pas­ <lb/>
            sions;since both these will not always find a place in the subjects <pb n="184"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            of which we shall have to treat. Some subjects are altogether <lb/>
            unconnected with the pathetic, which, though it cannot make <lb/>
            room for itself everywhere, yet, wherever it forces an entrance, <lb/>
            produces a most powerful effect.</p>
          <p>3. The most eminent authors are of opinion that there are <lb/>
            some things in pleading that require proof, and others that do <lb/>
            not require it; and I agree with them. Some, however, as <lb/>
            Celsus, think that an orator will not speak on any subject <lb/>
            unless there be some question about it; but the majority of <lb/>
            authors, as well as the general division of oratory into three <lb/>
            kinds, are opposed to him; unless we say that to praise what <lb/>
            is acknowledged to be honourable, and to blame what is ad­ <lb/>
            mitted to be dishonourable, is no part of an orator's business.</p>
          <p>4. All writers admit, however, that questions depend on <lb/>
            what is written or what is not written. Questions about some­ <lb/>
            thing written concern legality ; those about something not writ­ <lb/>
            ten concern fact. Hermagoras, and those who follow him, call <lb/>
            the former kind legal questions, the latter rational questions, <lb/>
            using the terms <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομιϰὸν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογιϰόν</foreign>. 5. Those who make all <lb/>
            questions relate to things and words are of the same opinion.</p>
          <p>It is also agreed that questions are either indefinite or <lb/>
            definite. The indefinite are those which, without regard to per­ <lb/>
            sons, time, place, and other such circumstances, are argued <lb/>
            for or against. This sort of questions the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέϭεις</foreign>: <lb/>
            Cicero * propositions ; others general questions relating to civil <lb/>
            affairs; others questions suitable for philosophical discussion ; <lb/>
            while Athenæus makes them parts of the cause to be decided. <lb/>
            6. Cicerot distinguishes them into questions relating to know­ <lb/>
            ledge and to action; so that “ Is the world governed by <lb/>
            divine providence ?" will be a question of knowledge, " Ought <lb/>
            we to take part in the management of public affairs?" a <lb/>
            question of action. The former kind he subdivides into three <lb/>
            species, “ whether a thing is," “ what it is," and “ of what <lb/>
            nature it is;" for all these points may be unknown; the latter <lb/>
            kind into two, “ how we should obtain the thing in question," <lb/>
            and “ how we should use it."</p>
          <p>7. Definite questions embrace particular circumstances, per­ <lb/>
            sons, times, and other things; they are called by the Greeks <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">υποθέϭεις</foreign>: by our countrymen, causes. In these the whole <note type="footnote"> * See. it 1, 9. </note><note type="footnote"> t Topic, c. 21; Partit. Orate c. 18. </note> <pb n="185"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.V.] </note> <lb/>
            inquiry seems to be about things and persons. 8. The indefi­ <lb/>
            nite is always the more comprehensive; for from it comes the <lb/>
            definite. To make this plainer by an example, the question <lb/>
            “ whether a man should marry"* is indefinite; the question <lb/>
            As whether Cato should marry" is definite, and may accordingly <lb/>
            become the subject of a suasory speech. But even those <lb/>
            which have no allusion to particular persons are generally <lb/>
            referred to something; for “ ought we to take a share in the <lb/>
            government of our country?" is an abstract question, but <lb/>
            “ ought we to take a share in the government of it under a <lb/>
            tyranny ?" has reference to something definite. 9. Yet here <lb/>
            also there lies concealed, as it were, a person; for the word <lb/>
            tyranny doubles the question, and there is a tacit considera­ <lb/>
            tion of time and quality; yet you cannot properly call the <lb/>
            question a cause.</p>
          <p>Those questions which I call indefinite are also called <lb/>
            general; and, if this be a proper term, definite questions will <lb/>
            also be special. But in every special question is included the <lb/>
            general, as being antecedent. 10. In judicial causes, too, I <lb/>
            know not whether whatever comes under the question of <lb/>
            quality is not general: Milo killed Clodius: He was in the <lb/>
            right to kill a lier-in-wait : does not this question arise. <lb/>
            Whether it be right to kill a lier-in-wait ? In conjectural <lb/>
            matters, also, are not these questions general,t was hatred, <lb/>
            or covetousness, the cause of the crime ? Ought we to trust to <lb/>
            evidence extracted by torture ? Ought greater credit to be <lb/>
            given to witnesses or to arguments ? As to definitions, it is <lb/>
            certain that everything comprehended in them is expressed <lb/>
            generally.</p>
          <p>11. Some think that those questions which are limited to <lb/>
            particular persons and causes may sometimes be called theses, <lb/>
            if only put in a different way; so that, when Orestes is ac <lb/>
            cused, it is a cause, but when it is inquired whether Orestes <lb/>
            was justly acquitted, it is a thesis; of which sort also is the <lb/>
            question whether Cato was right in giving Marcia to Horten <lb/>
            sius ? These writers distinguish a thesis from a cause by <note type="footnote"> * II. 4, 24, 25. </note><note type="footnote"> t The principal question and status in conjectural causes, or those <lb/>

            some particular act.</p>
          <p>12. Some, however, think that the consideration of general <lb/>
            questions is useless to an orator, as it is of no profit for it to <lb/>
            be proved, they say, that we ought to marry, or that we should <lb/>
            take part in the government of the state, if we are hindered <lb/>
            from doing so by age or ill-health. But we cannot make the <lb/>
            same objection to all questions of the kind; as, for example, <lb/>
            to these : whether virtue is the chief good, and whether the <lb/>
            world is governed by divine providence. 13. Moreover, in <lb/>
            inquiries that relate to an individual, though it is not enough <lb/>
            to consider the general question, yet we cannot arrive at the <lb/>
            decision of the particular point without discussing the general <lb/>
            question first. For how will Cato consider whether he himself <lb/>
            ought to marry, unless it be first settled whether men ought to <lb/>
            marry at all ? Or how will it be inquired whether Cato ought <lb/>
            to marry Marcia, if it be not previously decided whether Cato <lb/>
            ought to take a wife ? 14. Yet there are books in circulation <lb/>
            under the name of Hermagoras, which support the opinion <lb/>
            that I am opposing; whether it be that the title is fictitious, <lb/>
            or whether it were another Hermagoras that wrote them; for <lb/>
            how can they be the productions of the same Hermagoras who <lb/>
            wrote so much and so admirably on this art, when, as is <lb/>
            evident, even from Cicero's first book on rhetoric,- he divided <lb/>
            the subject-matter of oratory into theses and causes ? a division <lb/>
            which Cicero himself condemns, contending that the thesis is <lb/>
            no concern of the orator's, and referring this kind of question <lb/>
            wholly to the philosophers. 15 But Cicero has relieved me <lb/>
            from all shame at differing with him, as he not only censures! <lb/>

            which he wrote De Oratore,§ and in his Topica,∥ directs us <lb/>
            to abstract the discussion from particular persons and oc­ <lb/>

            state of the question, it is the same with regard to every kind <lb/>
            of thesis as with regard to causes. To this is added that there <lb/>
            are some questions that concern matters absolutely, and others <lb/>
            that refer to something particular; of the former kind is <lb/>
            whether a man ought to marry; of the latter, whether an old <lb/>
            man ought to marry; of the former kind, is whether a man be <lb/>
            brave ; of the latter, whether he be braver than another man.</p>
          <p>17. Apollodorus, to adopt the translation of his disciple <lb/>
            Valgius,* defines a cause thus: The cause is the matter having <lb/>
            regard in all its parts to the question; or, the cause is the <lb/>
            matter of which the question is the object. He then gives this <lb/>
            definition of the matter: The matter is the combination of per­ <lb/>
            sons, places, times, motives, means, incidents, acts, instruments, <lb/>
            sayings, things written and not written. 18. For my part, I <lb/>
            here understand by the cause what the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόθεσις</foreign>, by <lb/>
            the matter what they term <foreign xml:lang="grc">πείϭταϭις</foreign>. But some writers have <lb/>
            defined the cause itself in the same way as Apollodorus de­ <lb/>
            fines the matter. Isocrates says that a cause is a definite <lb/>
            question relating to civil affairs, or a disputed point between a <lb/>
            definite number of persons. Cicero† speaks of it in these words: <lb/>
            A cause is determined by reference to certain persons, places, <lb/>
            times, actions, and events, depending for decision either en all <lb/>
            or the majority of them. <note type="footnote"> * See iii. 1, 18. </note><note type="footnote"> † <unclear>Topc</unclear>. 21, <unclear/></note> <pb n="188"/>

            three points above-mentioned, 88—90. In every simple cause <lb/>
            there is but one state, 91—93. In complex causes there are <lb/>
            several states, either of the same or of different kinds ; examples, <lb/>

          <p>1. SINCE every cause, therefore, is comprehended in some <lb/>
            state,* I think that before I proceed to specify how the several <lb/>
            kinds of causes are to be managed, I must consider that ques­ <lb/>
            tion which has reference to all of them alike, what is a state ? <lb/>
            as well as whence it is drawn,t and how many and what kinds <lb/>
            of states there are ? Some have been of opinion, however, that <lb/>
            all these questions concern only judicial matters; but, when I <note type="footnote"> • I was very much in doubt, for some time, what English word I <lb/>
            should adopt for status, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτάσις</foreign>, but being able to find no English <lb/>
            word exactly equivalent to it, I thought it best, on the whole, to take <lb/>
            the derivative from it, state, which, whenever it is used for status in <lb/>
            this chapter, I shall print in italics. The exact meaning of it the <lb/>
            learner will perhaps best understand from sect. 6, where it is said to <lb/>
            be, not the question itself, but the genus quæstionis, or " nature of the <lb/>
            question." See also sections 9, and 73—76. The " status,” says <lb/>

            have treated of all the three kinds of oratory, the result will <lb/>
            make their ignorance apparent. 2. What I call the state,' <lb/>
            some term the settlement ;* others the question; others that <lb/>
            which appears from the question ; and Theodorus styles it the <lb/>
            general head, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰεϕάλαιον γενιϰώτατον</foreign>, to which everything else <lb/>
            is referred. But though the names are different, the meaning <lb/>
            is the same; nor is it of any consequence to learners by what <lb/>
            term anything is distinguished, so that the thing itself be <lb/>
            clear. 3. The Greeks call the state <foreign xml:lang="grc">στάϭις</foreign> : a name which <lb/>
            they think was not first given it by Hermagoras, but, as some <lb/>
            suppose, by Naucratis,t a disciple of Isocrates, or, as others <lb/>
            imagine, by Zopyrus ‡ of Clazomense ; though even Æschines <lb/>
            appears to use the term in his oration against Ctesiphon § <lb/>
            when he intreats the judges not to allow Demosthenes to <lb/>
            wander from the subject, but to oblige him to speak directly <lb/>
            to the state of the case. 4. The name is said to be derived <lb/>
            either from the fact that in it lies the commencement of con­ <lb/>
            troversy in the cause, or that the cause rests on it.</p>
          <p>Such is the origin of its name; let us now consider what it <lb/>
            is. Some have defined the state to be the first conflict of <lb/>
            questions, who, I think, have conceived rightly, but have not <lb/>
            expressed themselves with sufficient judgment. 5. For the <lb/>
            state is not the first conflict; You have done, I have not done, <lb/>
            but that which results from the first conflict, that is, the <lb/>
            nature of the question, you have done; I have not done; <lb/>
            has he done ? rou have done this; I have not done this; <lb/>
            what has he done ? But as it appears from these examples, <lb/>
            that the first sort of question depends on conjecture, the <lb/>
            other on definition, and as it is on these points that each <lb/>
            side will insist, the question will be one either of a conjectural <lb/>
            or of definitive state. 6. Supposing a person should say, sound <lb/>
            is the concussion of two bodies, he would be in the wrong, I <note type="footnote"> * Constitutionem.] This term is used by Cicero de Inv. 1. 8 ; Script. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.III. </note> <lb/>
            think; for the sound is not the concussion, but the result of <lb/>
            the concussion. This is a mistake, however, of but trifling <lb/>
            consequence; for the meaning is understood in whatever way <lb/>
            it be expressed; but in regard to oratory, an error of vast im­ <lb/>
            portance has arisen among students who have imperfectly <lb/>
            understood their authors, and who, as they read the words <lb/>
            first conflict, thought that the state was always to be taken <lb/>
            from the first question; a supposition which is altogether un­ <lb/>
            founded. 7. For there is no question that has not its state; <lb/>
            since there is none that is not founded on assertion and de­ <lb/>
            nial ; but some questions form an integral part of causes, and <lb/>
            on these a decision must be pronounced; while others are <lb/>
            introduced from without, contributing something, however, <lb/>
            like auxiliaries, to the general strength of the cause; and it <lb/>
            then happens that there are said to be several questions in the <lb/>
            same suit. 8. Of these the least important often occupies <lb/>
            the first place; for it is a common artifice among us to aban­ <lb/>
            don those points in which we have least trust, after they have <lb/>
            been dwelt upon, sometimes conceding them as it were, of our <lb/>
            own accord, to the opposite side, and sometimes contenting <lb/>
            ourselves with making an ascent from them to stronger <lb/>
            grounds of argument.</p>
          <p>9. A simple cause, though it may be defended in various <lb/>
            ways, cannot contain more than one point on which a decision <lb/>
            is to be pronounced; and hence the state of the cause will be <lb/>
            that which the pleader regards as the chief object to be gained, <lb/>
            and the judge as the chief object of attention ; for it is on this <lb/>
            that the cause will take its stand. 10. But of questions there <lb/>
            may be different states ;* since, to make this plain by a very <lb/>
            short example, when the accused says, Even if I did it, I was <lb/>
            right in doing it, he makes the state that of quality ; but when <lb/>
            he adds, but I did not do it, he makes it that of conjecture. <lb/>
            But the defence, I have not done it, is always the stronger; <lb/>
            and therefore I shall consider the state as lying in that argu­ <lb/>
            ment which I should use if I were not allowed to use more <lb/>
            than one. 11. We therefore rightly say the first conflict of causes, <lb/>
            not of questions. Cicero, in pleading for Rabirius Postumus, <lb/>
            makes it his object, in the first part of his speech, to show <lb/>
            that the charge could not be brought against a Roman knight ;t <note type="footnote"> * Comp. sect. 21. </note><note type="footnote"> t The first part extends to the end of c. 7. Cicero maintains <unclear>fast</unclear> </note> <pb n="191"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.1 </note> <lb/>
            and, in the latter part, he asserts that no money came into his <lb/>
            client's hands; but I should say that the state lies in that <lb/>
            which is the stronger point. 12. Nor, in his speech for Milo, <lb/>
            should I consider that the struggle in the cause. commences <lb/>
            with those early questions which are introduced immediately <lb/>
            after the exordium,t but where he proceeds to prove, with his <lb/>
            whole strength, that Clodius was a lier-in-wait, and was there­ <lb/>
            fore justly put to death. And that which an orator ought to <lb/>
            settle in his mind before everything else, even though he pur­ <lb/>
            pose to offer many arguments in support of his cause, is what <lb/>
            he would wish to be most apparent to the judge. But though <lb/>
            this is the first thing to be considered, it does not follow that <lb/>
            it will be the first to be stated.</p>
          <p>13. Others have thought that the state is the first point of <lb/>
            opposition offered by the party against whom you are pleading; <lb/>
            an opinion which Cicero‡ expressed in the following words: <lb/>
            On which the defence first takes its stand, as if ready to grapple <lb/>
            with the opponent to overthrow him. Hence, again, rises <lb/>
            another question, whether he who replies always determines <lb/>
            the state. To this notion Cornelius Celsus is eminently <lb/>
            opposed, saying the state does not arise from him who denies, <lb/>
            but from him who supports his own assertion; as, for instance, <lb/>
            if an accused person denies that a man has been killed, the <lb/>
            state would come from the accuser, because he would proceed <lb/>
            to prove what he had affirmed; if the accused should say that <lb/>
            the man was lawfully killed, the state would come from him, <lb/>
            and the affirmation be on his side, the burden of proof being <lb/>
            transferred from one party to the other. 14. With that writer <lb/>
            I do not agree; for what is said in contradiction to him is <lb/>
            nearer the truth, that there is no point of dispute if the party <lb/>
            with whom you are going to law makes no reply, and that <lb/>
            accordingly the state proceeds from the respondent. 15. Ir <lb/>
            my own opinion, however, the case happens sometimes one <lb/>
            way and sometimes another, varying according to the nature <lb/>
            of the cause; because the affirmation may be thought some­ <note type="footnote">by the Julian law de repetundis an action could not be brought against <lb/>

            rather the plaintiff that uses conjecture; (some, moved by this <lb/>
            consideration, have said that the state proceeding from <lb/>
            the defendant is a negative state;) and in a syllogism­ <lb/>
            the whole of the reasoning proceeds from him who affirms. <lb/>
            16. But because he who denies appears in those cases† also <lb/>
            to lay upon the opposite party the necessity of determining the <lb/>
            state, (for if he says, I have not done the deed, he will <lb/>
            oblige his opponent to use conjecture, and if he says My <lb/>
            opponent has not the law on his side, he will compel him to <lb/>
            have recourse to the syllogism,) let us grant that the state <lb/>
            proceeds from the defendant. Nevertheless, however, the <lb/>
            matter will come to the same thing, that sometimes the <lb/>
            plaintiff will determine the state, and sometimes the defendant. <lb/>
            17. For let this be the assertion of the accuser, You have <lb/>
            killed a man, if the accused deny the charge, it is the accused <lb/>
            that will determine the state ; but if he admits the truth of it, <lb/>
            but says that the man was an adulterer, and was lawfully <lb/>
            killed, (and it is certain that there is a law which gives per­ <lb/>
            mission to kill an adulterer,) then, unless the accuser makes <lb/>
            some reply, there will be no case. But if the accuser rejoins, <lb/>
            He was not an adulterer, refutation then commences on the <lb/>
            part of the accuser, and it is he that will determine the state ; <lb/>
            which will thus indeed have its origin in the first denial, but <lb/>
            that denial will be made by the accuser, not. by the accused. <lb/>
            18. It may happen, too, that the same question may make the <lb/>
            same person either accuser or accused; for instance, the law <lb/>
            says, "Let not him who has exercised the profession of an <lb/>
            actor sit in the first fourteen rows of seats but a man who <lb/>
            had appeared as an actor before the prætor in his garden, but <lb/>
            had not exhibited himself on the public stage, seated himself <note type="footnote"> * A syllogism is a status legalis, in which we bring under the meaning <lb/>

            Quintilian furnishes an example in b. vii c. 9.: if a man had killed his <lb/>
            mother, his accuser might use the syllogism against him in this way : <lb/>
            “ The law says, that he who kills his father is to be 3ewn up in a sack, <lb/>

            on one of those fourteen rows;. 19. the charge then brought <lb/>
            against him is, You have exercised the profession of an actor, <lb/>
            the denial is, I have not exercised it, and the question, What <lb/>
            it is to exercise the profession of an actor ? If he be accused <lb/>
            under the law respecting the theatre, the denial will proceed <lb/>
            from the accused; but if he be expelled from the theatre, and <lb/>
            demand reparation for unjust expulsion, the denial will be on the <lb/>
            part of the accuser. SO. But that which is laid down by the <lb/>
            majority of writers t will certainly be of more frequent occur­ <lb/>
            rence.</p>
          <p>Those have escaped these difficulties who have said that the <lb/>
            state is that which resuks from the affirmation and the denial; <lb/>
            as, You have done the deed, I have not done it, or I was right <lb/>
            in doing it. 21. Let us consider, however, whether that is the <lb/>
            state, or whether it is in that that the state lies. Hermagoras <lb/>
            calls that the state from which the matter in question is <lb/>
            understood, and to which also the proofs of each party are <lb/>
            directed as their object. My own opinion has always been, as <lb/>
            there are frequently different states of questions in a cause, to <lb/>
            regard that as the state of the cause which is the strongest <lb/>
            point in it, and on which the whole matter chiefly turns. If <lb/>
            any one profess to call this the general question, or the general <lb/>
            head, I shall not dispute with him on that point, (any more <lb/>
            than if he should invent yet another name by which the same <lb/>
            thing might be signified, although I know that many rhe­ <lb/>
            toricians have devoted whole volumes to this discussion,) but <lb/>
            I am satisfied to let it be called the state. 22. As there is the <lb/>
            greatest dissension among writers, however, on all other <lb/>
            matters, so, in regard to this, there appears to me to have <lb/>
            been extraordinary eagerness to advance different opinions ; <lb/>
            insomuch that it is neither agreed what number of states there <lb/>
            are, nor what are their names, nor which of them are general <lb/>
            and which special.</p>

            quantity, of which a twofold distinction has been made by later <lb/>
            writers, in reference to the questions “ how great?" and “ how <lb/>

            no case can occur that does not connect itself with some of <lb/>

            of opinion that there is in reality but one state, namely, the <lb/>
            conjectural; but who the rhetoricians that held this opinion <lb/>
            were, those authors have not told us, nor have I been able <lb/>
            anywhere to discover. They are said, however, to have formed <lb/>
            their notions on this ground, that our knowledge of everything <lb/>
            is the result of indications.* But from similar reasoning they <lb/>
            might say that the only state is that of quality, as a question <lb/>
            may always arise about the quality or nature of anything about <lb/>
            which we speak. 30. From either mode <unclear/> greatest con­ <lb/>
            fusion will result; nor will it make any difference, indeed, <lb/>
            whether we admit one kind of state only, or none at all, if all <lb/>
            causes are of the same nature. Conjecture is derived from <lb/>
            conjicere, " to throw together," that is, from making all our <lb/>
            reasonings converge towards truth; whence also interpreters <lb/>
            of dreams and omens are called conjectores, “ conjecturers." <lb/>
            But this sort of state has received various names, as will <lb/>
            appear from what follows.</p>
          <p>31. Some have made two kinds of states. Archidemus,t <lb/>
            for instance, admitted the conjectural and the definitive, ex­ <lb/>
            cluding that of quality ; because he thought that we imagine <lb/>
            about quality thus: ‡ "What. is unjust? what is iniquitous? <lb/>
            what is it to be disobedient ?" questions which he terms de <lb/>
            eodem et alio,§ " about identity and difference.” 32. With <lb/>
            this opinion theirs is at variance who would make indeed <lb/>
            two kinds of state, but one negative, and one juridical; the <lb/>
            negative is the same as that which we call the conjectural, <lb/>
            to which some have given the term negative absolutely, others <lb/>
            partially, because they considered that the accuser employs <lb/>
            conjecture, and the accused, denial. The juridical is that <lb/>
            which in Greek is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">διϰαιολογιϰός</foreign>, "treating of right." <lb/>
            33. But as quality is set aside by Archidemus, so by these <lb/>
            writers is rejected definition, which they make dependent on <note type="footnote"> * Signis.] See b. v. c. 3. But perhaps signa is used in a rather <lb/>

            the juridical state, and think that we must imagine “ whether <lb/>
            it is right that what is charged against a person should be <lb/>
            called sacrilege," for example, “ or theft, or madness." 34. <lb/>
            Of this opinion was Pamphilus,* but he distinguished quality <lb/>
            into several kinds.</p>
          <p>Many succeeding writers, altering only the names, have <lb/>
            divided states of causes into two kinds by saying that they are <lb/>
            either about something that is doubtful, or about something that <lb/>
            is certain ; for such indeed is the case; nor can it be other­ <lb/>
            wise than either certain that a thing has been done, or uncei <lb/>
            tain ; if it is uncertain, the state is conjectural; if it is certain, <lb/>
            there is room for other kinds of states. 35. Indeed, Apollodorus <lb/>
            says the same thing, when he observes that the question lies <lb/>
            either in things external,† by which conjecture is settled, or in <lb/>
            our own opinions; calling the former sort of questions <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱαγ­ <lb/>
            ματιϰόν</foreign>, " practical," the latter <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεϱι ἐννοιας</foreign>, “ dependent on <lb/>
            judgment.” Those also say the same who make the two kinds <lb/>
            of state, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπϱόληπτον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱοληπτιϰόν</foreign>,‡ dubious and presumptive, <lb/>
            the latter meaning what is evident. 36. Theodorus, too, <lb/>
            expresses himself similarly, as he thinks that the question is <lb/>
            either as to whether a thing has happened, or as to particulars <lb/>
            relating to what is admitted to have happened, that is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεϱι <lb/>
            οὐσιας ϰαι συμεηϰότων</foreign>. For in all these distinctions the first <lb/>
            kind of state belongs to conjecture, the second to other matters. <lb/>
            But these other matters Apollodorus makes to be two, quality <lb/>
            and de nomine, that is definition; Theodorus four, existence. <lb/>
            quality, quantity, and relation. 37. There are some also who <lb/>
            make the question de eodem et alio, “ about identity and differ­ <lb/>
            ence," belong sometimes to quality and sometimes to definition.</p>
          <p>Posidonius, too, ranges states of causes under two heads, <lb/>
            words and things. With respect to a word, he thinks that the <note type="footnote"> * Mentioned by Aristotle, Rhet. it 23. Whether he is the same that <lb/>

            who owns that he stole from it the money of a private indi­ <lb/>
            vidual, ie guilty of sacrilege. † Quality he divides into fact <lb/>
            and what is written; to what is written he assigns four legal <lb/>
            questions,‡ setting aside exception ;§ quantity and intention || <lb/>
            he puts under conjecture.¶</p>
          <p>39. There is also another method of division into two states, <lb/>
            which tells us that a question must relate either to substance <lb/>
            or to quality; and that quality is considered either in its <lb/>
            most general sense, or with regard to particulars.** 40. To <lb/>
            substance belongs conjecture; for inquiry may be made con­ <lb/>
            cerning *any. thing whether it has been, is, or will be;" and <note type="footnote"> * Questions as to the written letter of the law are quœstiones legale. <lb/>
            Questions as to other matters, not written, are decided by conjecture, <lb/>

            to the temple. See sect. 41 and 49. " This is an example much used <lb/>

            sometimes concerning the intention of it; and this method is <lb/>
            better than their's who have named the conjectural state a state <lb/>
            of fact, as if inquiry could be made only concerning the past <lb/>
            and concerning what has been done. 41. As to the considera <lb/>
            tion of quality in its most general sense, as " Whether that is <lb/>
            honourable which is everywhere commended," it rarely occurs in <lb/>
            judicial proceedings; but with reference to particulars, ques­ <lb/>
            tions arise either about some common term, as “ Whether he <lb/>
            has committed sacrilege who has stolen a private person’s <lb/>
            money from a temple," or about a cama given to some par­ <lb/>
            ticular act, when it is certain that an act has been done, and <lb/>
            there is no doubt what the act that has been done is. Under <lb/>
            this head are included all questions about what is honourable, <lb/>
            just, expedient. 42. In these states, too, are said to be com­ <lb/>
            prehended others, because quantity is sometimes referred to <lb/>
            conjecture, as in the question, " Is the sun greater than the <lb/>
            earth ? ” and sometimes to quality, as when it is asked, “ What <lb/>
            degree of punishment or reward it is just that some particular <lb/>
            individual should receive;” because, also, exception t has <lb/>
            relation to quality, and definition is concerned with ex­ <lb/>
            ception ; ‡ 43. and because, moreover, contradictory laws, and <lb/>
            the ratiocinutory state,§ that is, the syllogism, and questions <lb/>
            in general, regarding writings and the intention of the writer, <lb/>
            depend on considerations of equity ; (except that this last case <lb/>
            sometimes admits of conjecture, as when we inquire what the <lb/>
            legislator meant;) but ambiguity must necessarily be explained <lb/>
            by conjecture, because, as it is plain that the words may be <lb/>
            understood in two ways, the question is solely about the in­ <lb/>
            tention.</p>
          <p>44. By a great number of writers there are recognised three || <lb/>

            because they are called states by most writers, though some <lb/>
            would prefer that they should be called legal questions.</p>
          <p>47. Athenæus has made four states, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱοτϱεπτιϰὴο</foreign>r <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱοϱ­ <lb/>
            μητιϰὴ στάσις</foreign>, that is, the exhortative, which belongs properly <lb/>
            to the suasory ; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">συντελιϰὴ</foreign>, by which it appears from what <lb/>
            follows, rather than from the name itself, that the con­ <lb/>
            jectural is signified ; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπαλλαϰτιϰὴ</foreign>, (which is the definitive,) <lb/>
            for it consists in a change of terms ;* and the juridical, which <lb/>
            he distinguishes by the same Greek name t as other writers. <lb/>
            For there is, as I said,‡ great variation as to names. 48. There <lb/>
            are some who think the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπαλλαϰτιϰὴ στάσις</foreign> is the exceptional,§ <lb/>
            looking to the notion of change contained in the name <lb/>
            Others, as Cæcilius and Theon, have made the same number of <lb/>
            states, but of a different kind: Whether a thing is 1 what it is ? <lb/>
            of what species it is ? how great it is 1 49. Aristotle in his <lb/>
            Rhetoric|| [divides the whole matter into three parts: What <lb/>
            is true, what is to be sought or avoided, (which belongs to the <lb/>
            deliberative department of oratory,) and the consideration do <lb/>
            eadem atque alio, “about identity and difference;" but, by <lb/>
            division, he arrives at such a conclusion that he] thinks we <lb/>
            must examine, as to any thing, whether it is, of what nature <lb/>
            it is, how great it is, and of what parts it consists.¶ In one <lb/>
            place, however, he notices the force of definition, where he <lb/>
            says that some charges are thus met: “I have taken, but I <lb/>
            have not stolen; I struck, but I did nothing wrong." 50. Cicero <lb/>
            also in his books of rhetoric** had enumerated four states re­ <lb/>
            garding fact, name, kind, and action ; so that conjecture should <lb/>

          <p>61. Some writers on rhetoric have made five states, those of . <lb/>
            conjecture, definition, quality, quantity, and relation. Theo­ <lb/>
            dorus also, as I remarked,§ adopts the same number of general <lb/>
            heads, whether a thing is, what it is, of what species it is, how <lb/>
            great it is, and to what it has reference. The last he regards as <lb/>
            having most concern with comparison, since better and worse, <lb/>
            greater and less, are terms that have no meaning unless they <lb/>
            refer to something. 52. But relation, as I observed before,|| <lb/>
            affects questions of legal right, such as, " Has this man a right <lb/>
            to go to law ?" or “Is it fit that such a person should do such <lb/>
            a thing?" or “May he proceed against a particular person," or <lb/>
            " at a particular time," or "in a particular manner ?" for all <lb/>
            such inquiries must have reference to something.</p>
          <p>53. Others think that there are six states: conjecture, which <lb/>
            they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένεσις</foreign> :¶ quality, peculiarity, that is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδιότης</foreign> a term in <lb/>
            which definition is implied; quantity, which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀξια</foreign>;** <lb/>
            comparison; exception, for which, also, a new name, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετά</foreign>-J¡£'f'á.­ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">στασις</foreign>, has been found ; new, I mean, as applied to state, for <lb/>
            it had been previously used by Hermagoras in a different way, <lb/>
            to denote one of the various sorts of juridical questions.</p>
          <p>54. Others have been of opinion that there are seven ; by <lb/>
            whom neither exception, nor quantity, nor comparison were <lb/>
            admitted; but, in the place of those three, were substituted <lb/>

          <p>By some writers another distinction has been introduced, <lb/>
            that of giving the name of “ states " only to the status rationales, <lb/>
            and calling the status legales, as I said - before, “questions;” <lb/>
            as in the former the question is about fact, in the latter about <lb/>
            the written letter. Others, on the contrary, have preferred that <lb/>
            the status legales should be called “states," and the status <lb/>
            rationales " questions." 56. But others have thought that there <lb/>
            are only three status rationales, whether a thing is, what it is, <lb/>
            and of what kind it is ; Hermagoras is the only one who has <lb/>
            made four, conjecture, peculiarity, exception, quality, to <lb/>
            which latter he applies the expression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατὰ συμβεβηϰότα</foreign>, <lb/>
            “according to accidents," t adding as an explanation, “whether <lb/>
            it happen to a person to be good or bad.‡57. Quality he then <lb/>
            distinguishes into four species, as relating to things to be sought <lb/>
            or avoided, which fall under the deliberative department of <lb/>
            oratory; to persons, to whom the panegyrical kind applies ; to <lb/>
            things in general, a department which he calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱαγματιϰή</foreign>, and <lb/>
            in which the question is about things themselves, without any <lb/>
            reference to persons, as “whether he is free who is under trial <lb/>
            about his liberty; § whether riches beget pride; whether a <lb/>
            thing is just or good ;” and to judicial questions, in which <lb/>
            similar inquiries are made, but with regard to certain definite <lb/>
            persons; as, " whether a certain person acted justly or well in a <lb/>
            particular transaction ?" 68. Nor am I ignorant that in the first <lb/>
            book of Cicero|| on Rhetoric there is another explanation of the <lb/>
            part relating to things in general, as it is there said that “it is <lb/>
            the department in which it is considered what is right accord­ <lb/>
            ing to civil usage and according to equity ; a department with <lb/>

            dependent on reasoning, that of ambiguity, and that which <lb/>
            concerns contradictory laws. 62. Albutius,¶ adopting the <lb/>

            what I have said on this subject has exceeded due bounds.</p>
          <p>63. For myself, I confess that I am now inclined towards <lb/>
            an opinion somewhat different from that which I formerly <lb/>
            held; and perhaps it would be safest for me, if I regarded <lb/>
            only my own reputation, to make no change in that which <lb/>
            for many years I have not only thought but have sanctioned <lb/>
            with my approbation. 64. But I cannot endure to be guilty <lb/>
            of dissimulation in any point on which I give judgment, <lb/>
            especially in a work which I am composing with a view to <lb/>
            being of some profit to well-disposed young men; for Hippo­ <lb/>
            crates,* so celebrated in the art of medicine, is thought to have <lb/>
            acted most honourably in acknowledging some mistakes that he <lb/>
            had made, in order to prevent posterity from erring with him. <lb/>
            Cicero,! too, did not hesitate to condemn some of his published <lb/>
            works and others which he wrote afterwards, as his Catullus <lb/>
            and Lucullus, and those books on Rhetoric to which I just now <lb/>
            alluded. 65. For longer perseverance in study would be <lb/>
            superfluous, if we were not at liberty to find out something <lb/>
            better than what was advanced before. Nothing however of <lb/>
            what I then taught was useless, for what I shall now teach will <lb/>
            recur to the same principles, so that no one will repent of <lb/>
            having learned from me. All I intend to do, is to re-produce <lb/>
            the same materials, and to arrange them with somewhat better <lb/>
            effect. But I wish every one to be satisfied that I com­ <lb/>
            municate new light to others as soon as I have gained it <lb/>
            myself.</p>
          <p>66. According to the system of most authors, then, I ad <lb/>
            hered to three ratiocinatory states, those of conjecture, quality, <note type="footnote"> * Hippocrates, as he was dressing the wound of a man who had <lb/>
            been struck with a stone on the head, found that he had been deceived <lb/>
            with regard to the sutures of the skull, and confessed his mistake. <lb/>
            This is mentioned to his honour by Celsus, viii. 4, who contrasts his <lb/>
            noble-mindedness with the meanness of little men, who, quia nihil <lb/>

            produced another edition in four books, in which he made Varro tLe <lb/>

            and definition, and one legal.* These were my general states. <lb/>
            The legal I divided into five species, those relating to writing <lb/>
            and intention, contradictory laws, induction,† ambiguity, and <lb/>
            exception. 67. I now see that the fourth t of the general <lb/>
            states may be withdrawn from them; for the primary division is <lb/>
            sufficient, by which I pronounced § some states to be ratioci­ <lb/>
            natory, others legal; thus the fourth will not be a state, but a <lb/>
            species of question; otherwise it would be a ratiocinatory state. <lb/>
            68. From those also, which I called species, I withdrew ex­ <lb/>
            ception; having frequently indeed observed, (as all who listened <lb/>
            to my instructions can remember,) and having asserted even <lb/>
            in those lectures which were published without my consent.|| <lb/>
            (but in which I however included this remark,) that the state <lb/>
            of exception can scarcely be found in any cause so evidently <lb/>
            that some other may not seem to be rightly named in that <lb/>
            cause instead of it; and that in consequence that state had <lb/>
            by some writers been wholly set aside. 69. Yet I am not <lb/>
            ignorant that many cases are treated under this state of ex­ <lb/>
            ception, as in almost all causes in which a person is said to <lb/>
            have failed from irregularity in for .¶, such questions as these <lb/>
            arise : “Whether it was lawful for such a person to bring an <lb/>
            action at all, or against some other particular person, or before <lb/>
            some particular judge, or at some particular time," and what­ <lb/>
            ever other similar questions may be asked. 70. But persons, <lb/>
            times, suits, and other matters, are considered under the state <lb/>
            of exception for some pre-existent cause; so that the ques­ <lb/>
            tion lies, not in the state of exception itself, but in the cause <lb/>
            for which recourse is had of the state of exception. “You <note type="footnote"> * See a v. sect. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> t Collectivum statum. The same as the syllogismus. Compare <lb/>

            ought not to seek restitution of this deposit before the prætor, but <lb/>
            before the consuls; for the sum is too great to come under the <lb/>
            cognizance of the prætor;” the question then is, “whether the <lb/>
            sum is too great for the praetores cognizance;" and this is a <lb/>
            question as to fact. 71. 11 It is not lawful for you to proceed <lb/>
            against me, for you could not become agent for the opposite <lb/>
            party;" here the question for judgment is, " whether he could <lb/>
            become agent." “You ought not to have proceeded by inter­ <lb/>
            dict, but to have made a demand;" the matter in doubt is, <lb/>
            “whether the proceeding by interdict was right." 72. All <lb/>
            these points come under the head of legal questions. Do not <lb/>
            prescriptions,* also, (even those in which exception appears <lb/>
            most manifest,) lead to the same sorts of questions as those <lb/>
            laws under which the action is brought, so that the inquiry will <lb/>
            be either about the name of an act,f about what is written and <lb/>
            the intent of the writer, or about something to be settled by <lb/>
            argument. The state then springs from the question ; the <lb/>
            state of exception does not embrace the point for which the <lb/>
            pleader contends, but the question because of which he con­ <lb/>
            tends,‡ 73. This will be made plainer by an example: “You <lb/>
            have killed a man; I have not killed him ;” the question is <lb/>
            " whether the accused did kill the man," the state is the con­ <lb/>
            jectural.§ The following case is different: “I have a right to <lb/>
            proceed against you; you have not;” when the question will <lb/>
            be, “ whether he has a right," and hence the state; for whether. <lb/>
            he be allowed to have a right or not, belongs to the event, not <lb/>
            to the cause, and to that which the judge may decide, not to <lb/>
            that because of which he may give such decision. 74. This is <lb/>
            similar to it: “You deserve to be punished ; I do not deserve <lb/>
            to be punished;” the judge will see whether lie does deserve <lb/>
            to be punished; but here there will not be either question or <lb/>
            state; where then ? “You deserve to be punished, for you <lb/>
            have killed a man ; I have not killed a man:" here then is a <lb/>
            question whether he did kill a man?" "I ought to be <lb/>

            You have no right to proceed against me, because you are <lb/>
            infamous ;” here the question is " whether he is infamous," or <lb/>
            " whether an infamous man has a right to proceed against <lb/>
            another t" and here are both questions and states.† The kind <lb/>
            of cause ‡ is therefore exceptional, like the comparative, and <lb/>
            that of recrimination.</p>
          <p>76. But, you will say, “I have a right; you have not," is <lb/>
            similar to “you have killed; I did right in killing;" I do not <lb/>
            deny that it is so; but this does not make a state; for these <lb/>
            are not propositions, (if they were, the cause would receive no <lb/>
            explanation from them,) as propositions must be accompanied <lb/>
            with reasons. “Horatius committed a crime, for he killed his <lb/>
            sister; he committed no crime, for he ha d a right to kill her <lb/>
            who mourned at the death of an enemy;" the question here <lb/>
            will be, “whether this was a sufficient reason for killing her <lb/>
            and thus the state will be that of quality. 77. In like manner <lb/>
            with regard to exception: “You have no right to disin­ <lb/>
            herit § your son, for an infamous person is not allowed to <lb/>
            engage in any legal process; I have a right, for disinheriting <lb/>
            is not a legal process;" the question is, “what is a legal pro­ <lb/>
            cess?” here we shall use definition;|| “you are not allowed to <lb/>
            disinherit;" here will be the syllogism.¶ The case will be <lb/>
            similar with regard to all matters concerning the ratiocinatory <lb/>
            and legal states. 78. I am not unaware, however, that some <lb/>
            have included exception under the ratiocinatory kind of <lb/>
            states, in this way: “I have killed a man, but by order of the <lb/>
            emperor;” “I gave up the offerings in the temple to a tyrant, <lb/>

            that is, it was not my fault, but the fault of those circum­ <lb/>
            stances. 79. From these authors I differ still more widely ;* for <lb/>
            it is not the act that is brought under the exceptional state, <lb/>
            but the cause of the act, as happens indeed in almost every <lb/>
            defence; and besides, he who adopts such a mode of defence, <lb/>
            does not depart from the state of quality, t for he says that he <lb/>
            himself is free from blame; so that two kinds of quality ‡ are <lb/>
            rather to be distinguished; one, by which the act and the <lb/>
            accused party, the other, by which the accused only, is de­ <lb/>
            fended.§</p>
          <p>80. We must therefore adhere to those writers whose- au­ <lb/>
            thority Cicero|| has followed, and who say that there are three <lb/>
            points about which there is a question in every cause; whether <lb/>
            a thing is,¶ what it is,** and of what species it is;†† a distinc­ <lb/>
            tion which even nature herself teaches us; for there must first <lb/>
            of all be something which is the object of the question ; con­ <lb/>
            cerning which it certainly cannot be determined what and of <lb/>
            what species it is, until it be settled that it really exists ; and <lb/>
            this, therefore, is the first question. 81, But as to that which <lb/>
            is proved to exist, it does not immediately appear what it is. <lb/>
            When this point is also decided, there remains, last of all, the <lb/>
            quality; and, when all these particulars are settled, nothing <lb/>

            will not be without advantage. Let students learn, therefore, <lb/>
            before all, that there are four modes of proceeding in every <lb/>
            cause; which four modes he who is going to plead ought to. <lb/>
            make it his first business to consider. For, to begin first of <lb/>
            all with the defendant, by far the strongest mode of defence is, <lb/>
            if the charge which is made can be denied;- the next, if an act <lb/>
            of the kind charged against the accused can be said not to have <lb/>
            been done ;† the third, and most honourable, if what is done is <lb/>
            proved to have been justly done.‡ If we cannot command <lb/>
            these methods, the last and only mode of defence is that of <lb/>
            eluding an accusation, which can neither be denied nor com­ <lb/>
            bated, by the aid of some point of law, so as make it appear <lb/>
            that the action has not been brought in due legal form. 84. <lb/>
            Hence arise questions referring either to the general action <lb/>
            or to exception ;§ for there are some things objectionable in <lb/>
            their own nature, yet allowed by law, as it was permitted, <lb/>
            for instance, by the twelve tables, that the body of a debtor <lb/>
            might be divided among his creditors ;ll but public feeling has <lb/>
            set aside that law; and some things may be equitable in them­ <lb/>
            selves, but prohibited by law, as liberty in making wills...</p>
          <p>85. By the accuser nothing more is to be kept in view than <lb/>
            that he must prove that something was done ; that a particular <lb/>
            thing was done; that it was done wrongfully; and that he <lb/>

          <p>86. These plans, as it were, and forms, of proceeding, which <lb/>
            I then called general states, resolve themselves, as I showed,t <lb/>
            into two general kinds, the one dependent on reasoning, the <lb/>
            other on legality. The one dependent on reasoning is the <lb/>
            more simple, as it consists merely in the contemplation of the <lb/>
            nature of things; and it is sufficient, therefore, in respect to <lb/>
            it, to mention conjecture, definition, quality. 87. Of legal <lb/>
            questions there must necessarily be more species, as laws are <lb/>
            numerous, and have various forms. We rest on the words of <lb/>
            one law, and on the spirit of another; when we find no law <lb/>
            ready to support us, we press some one into our service; we <lb/>
            compare some, one with another; we interpret some in a <lb/>
            manner different from that in which they are usually under­ <lb/>
            stood. 88. Thus from those three states ‡ spring the follow­ <lb/>
            ing resemblances as it were of states, sometimes simple, <lb/>
            sometimes mixed,§ yet always wearing their own peculiar <lb/>
            appearance, as that which refers to what is written and what is <lb/>
            intended, which, without doubt, is included under quality or <lb/>
            conjecture; that which is treated by syllogism, which has <lb/>
            regard especially to quality; that which respects contradictory <lb/>
            laws, which belongs to the same states as what is written and <lb/>
            what is intended; and that referring to ambiguity, which is <lb/>
            always settled by conjecture 89. Definition also is common <lb/>
            to both kinds || of questions, those which depend on the con­ <lb/>
            sideration of matters of fact, and those which are to be decided <lb/>
            by adherence to the written letter.</p>
          <p>All these questions, though they fall under those three <lb/>

            But I shall speak of particular questions when I proceed to treat <lb/>
            of the rules for division.-</p>
          <p>This is agreed among all writers, that in every simple cause <lb/>
            there is but one single state ;† but that many questions, which, <lb/>
            as secondary points, are referred to that in which the main <lb/>
            point for judgment is contained, may be comprised in one and <lb/>
            the same cause; (92. I also think that it is sometimes doubtful <lb/>
            what state we ought to adopt, as many means of defence are <lb/>
            employed against one accusation; and as it is said with regard <lb/>
            to the colour ‡ of a statement of facts, that that is the best <lb/>
            which a speaker can best maintain, so it may be said in this <lb/>
            case also, that that state should be chosen, in support of which <lb/>
            the orator can put forth most strength; 93. and accordingly, <lb/>
            in settling a mode of defence for Milo, one course found favour <lb/>
            with Cicero, when he pleaded the cause, and another with <lb/>
            Brutus, when he composed a speech for Milo by way of exer­ <lb/>

            killed a bad citizen;) 94. but that in complex causes two or <lb/>
            three states may be found, either of different kinds, as when a <lb/>
            person denies that he did one thing,- and maintains that he <lb/>
            was in the right in doing another,† or of the same kind, as <lb/>
            when a person denies two charges, or all the charges brought <lb/>
            against him. 95. This happens, also, when there is a question <lb/>
            about some one thing which several persons are trying to <lb/>
            obtain, either all relying on the same kind of claim, as that of <lb/>
            relationship; or some on one kind and some on another, as <lb/>
            some on a will and some on relationship. But whenever there <lb/>
            are several claimants, and one kind of defence is made against <lb/>
            one and another against another, there must necessarily be <lb/>
            several kinds of slates; as in the following subject of contro­ <lb/>
            versy, the law standing thus: 96. Let wills made according to <lb/>
            the laws be valid. Let the children of intestate parents be heirs. <lb/>
            Let a disinherited son possess none of his father's property. ‡ <lb/>
            Let an illegitimate son, if born before one that is legitimate, be <lb/>
            to his father as legitimate ; if born after, only as a citizen.§ Let <lb/>
            it be lawful for every father to give his son in adoption. Let it <lb/>
            be lawful for every son given in adoption to return into his own <lb/>
            family if his natural father dies without children. 97. A. <lb/>
            father, who, having two sons, had allowed one to be adopted <lb/>
            by another man, and had disinherited the other, had after­ <lb/>
            wards an illegitimate son, and then, after appointing the dis­ <lb/>
            inherited son his heir, died. All the three laid claim to the <lb/>

            98. To him who was named as heir in the will was opposed <lb/>
            the law, Let a disinherited son possess none of his father s pro­ <lb/>
            perty, and hence arose the state referring to what is written <lb/>
            and what is intended, it being inquired “whether he could <lb/>
            inherit in any way? whether according to the intention of the <lb/>
            father? whether as being named as heir in the will?" As to <lb/>
            the illegitimate son, there arise two considerations, that he was <lb/>
            born after the legitimate sons, and was not born before a <lb/>
            legitimate one. 99. The first consideration goes into the syl­ <lb/>
            logism† or inference, “ whether sons alienated from the family‡ <lb/>
            are in the same condition as if they had never been born ?"§ <lb/>
            The other is that regarding what is written and what is in­ <lb/>
            tended; for it is admitted that he was not born before a legiti­ <lb/>
            mate son; but he will rest his cause on the intention of the <lb/>
            law, which he will say was, that an illegitimate son, born when <lb/>
            there was no longer a legitimate son in the family, should be <lb/>
            considered as legitimate. 100. He will also set aside the <lb/>
            written letter of the law, by saying that "it is certainly no <lb/>
            detriment to an illegitimate son if a legitimate one was not <lb/>
            born after him,” and will insist on this argument: Suppose <lb/>
            that an illegitimate son only be born; in what relation will he <lb/>
            stand to his father ? only as a citizen ? Yet he will not be born <lb/>
            after a legitimate son. Will he be as a son in every respect ? <lb/>
            yet he will not be born before a legitimate one. If, therefore, we <lb/>
            can conclude nothing from the words of the laC, we must take <lb/>
            our stand on the intention of it. 101. Nor let it perplex any <lb/>

            him who is named as heir in the will, “Though it be lawful <lb/>
            for you to return, I am still heir;" and the state will be the <lb/>
            same- as in regard to the claim of the disinherited son; for <lb/>
            the question is " whether a disinherited son can be heir <lb/>
            102. In the next place, it will be said by both, (as well by the <lb/>
            one who is named heir as by the illegitimate one,) " It is not <lb/>
            lawful for you to return into the family, for our father did not <lb/>
            lie without children." But, in saying this, each of the two <lb/>
            will rest his case on his own peculiar ground; for the disin­ <lb/>
            herited son will assert, “ that a disinherited son is also one of <lb/>
            the children," and will draw a proof of his assertion from the <lb/>
            very law by which it is pretended that he is set aside; as it <lb/>
            would be superfluous, be would say, for a disinherited son to <lb/>
            be forbidden to inherit the property of his father, if be were to <lb/>
            be accounted as a stranger, but, as he would have been, by his <lb/>
            right as a son, the heir of his father if he had died without a <lb/>
            will, the law is now brought against him, which, however, does <lb/>
            not prevent him from being a son, but from being an heir. <lb/>
            The state, then, will be that of definition: the question, <lb/>
            " what is a son ?" 103. The illegitimate son, on his part, will <lb/>
            allege that his father did not die without children, resting on <lb/>
            the same arguments which he used in making his claim at <lb/>
            first, to show that he was a son ; unless he also have recourse <lb/>
            to the state of definition, and ask, “whether illegitimate chil­ <lb/>
            dren are not children ?" There will thus be in this one cause <lb/>
            either two special legal states, those of the letter and intention <lb/>
            and the syllogism, besides one of definition, or those three <lb/>
            which are the only† real and natural states, that of conjecture, <lb/>
            with regard to the writing and intention of the writer, that of <lb/>
            quality in the syllogism,‡ and that of definition, which suf­ <lb/>
            ficiently explains itself.</p>
          <p>In every kind of legal controversy, too, must be compre­ <lb/>
            bended a cause, a matter for judgment, and the containing <lb/>
            point,§ for there is nothing brought into question in which <note type="footnote"> * Namely, de scripto et voluntate.

          <p>Of panegyric or laudatory eloquence; not wholly distinct from prac­ <lb/>
            tical discussion, § 1, 2. An orator does not always speak on <lb/>
            doubtful points, 3, 4. Panegyric sometimes requires proof and <lb/>
            defence, and very frequently amplification, 5, 6. Praise of the <lb/>
            gods, 7—9. Praise of men more varied, 10, 11. Men extolled <lb/>
            for personal endowments and fortunate circumstances, 12—14. <lb/>
            For mental qualifications, 15, 16. For memorials which they <lb/>
            leave of themselves, 17, 18. In censure the case is reversed, 19— <lb/>
            21. On praise of the living, 22. It makes a difference where a <lb/>
            panegyric is delivered, 23, 24. Advantage may be taken by the <lb/>
            orator of the proximity of certain virtues to certain vices, 25. <lb/>
            Praise of cities, places, public works, 26, 27. What state most <lb/>
            prevailed in this department of oratory, 28.</p>
          <p>1. I SHALL commence with that species of oratory which is <lb/>
            devoted to praise and censure. This species Aristotle, and <lb/>
            Theophrastus who follows him, seem to have excluded alto­ <lb/>
            gether from the practical department of speaking,‡ and to <lb/>
            have considered that its only object is to please the audience <lb/>
            an object which is indeed intimated by its name epideictic from <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲπιδείχνυμι</foreign>, to display. 2. But the usage of the Romans has <lb/>
            given it a place in civil transactions; for funeral orations are <lb/>
            often a duty attached to some public office, and are frequently <lb/>
            assigned to the magistrates by a decree of the senate ; and to <lb/>
            commend or censure a witness is not without effect on the <note type="footnote">and of the greatest efficiency for obtaining it, especially on the side of <lb/>
            the plaintiff. Capperonier. See c. 11, sect. 4—10. </note><note type="footnote"> * C. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> † See the end of c. 3, and the whole of c. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Opposing the epideictio, as being for display, to the pragmatic, or <lb/>

            result of trials; while it is lawful, also, to produce panegyrists <lb/>
            on behalf of accused persons ;* and the written compositions <lb/>
            published against Cicero's competitors,† against Lucius Piso, <lb/>
            Clodius, and Curio, are full of invective, and yet were received <lb/>
            as opinions in the senate. 3. But I do not deny that some <lb/>
            discourses of this kind have been composed merely for osten­ <lb/>
            tation, as those in praise of the gods, and of the heroes of <lb/>
            former times; a fact by which a question noticed above‡ is <lb/>
            solved, and by which it is shown that those were mistaken who <lb/>
            thought that an orator would never speak on any but doubtful <lb/>
            subjects. 4. Are the praises of Jupiter Capitolinus, a perpetual <lb/>
            subject at the sacred contests, doubtful ? Or are they not <lb/>
            treated in oratorical style ?</p>
          <p>But as panegyric which is employed for practical purposes, <lb/>
            requires proof, so that which is composed for display, calls <lb/>
            sometimes for some semblance of proof; 5. as the orator who <lb/>
            should say that Romulus was the son of Mars, and was nursed <lb/>
            by a she-wolf, would offer in proof of his celestial origin, the <lb/>
            the arguments that, being thrown into a running stream, he <lb/>
            could not be drowned; that he had such success in all his <lb/>
            undertakings, that it is not incredible that he was sprung from <lb/>
            the god who presides over war; and that the people of those <lb/>
            times had no doubt that he was even received into heaven. <lb/>
            6. But some particulars in such subjects will be treated as if <lb/>
            they required defence; as in a panegyric on Hercules, the <lb/>
            orator would perhaps apologize for his change of dress with the <lb/>
            queen of Lydia, and the tasks, as we are told, imposed upon <lb/>
            him. But the peculiar business of panegyric is to amplify and <lb/>
            embellish its subjects.</p>
          <p>This kind of eloquence is devoted chiefly to gods or men; <lb/>
            though it is sometimes employed about animals and things in <lb/>
            animate. 7. In praising the gods, we shall, in the first place <note type="footnote"> * If a man, for instance, was publicly accused, and had previously <lb/>
            governed a province well, ten deputies might be sent from it to appear <lb/>

            from Marseilles and Narbonne to speak in praise of Fonteius. Turne­ <lb/>

            of Asconius Pedianus on that oration. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ C. 5, sect. 3. </note> <pb n="220"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            express a general veneration for the majesty of their nature, <lb/>
            and shall then eulogize the peculiar power of each, and such of <lb/>
            their inventions as have conferred benefit on mankind. 8. In <lb/>
            regard to Jupiter, for instance, his power in ruling all things <lb/>
            is to be extolled ; in regard to Mars, his supremacy in war; in <lb/>
            regard to Neptune, his command of the sea. In respect to <lb/>
            inventions, we extol, in praising Minerva, that of the arts; in <lb/>
            praising Mercury, that of letters; in praising Apollo, that of <lb/>
            medicine ; in praising Ceres, that of corn; in praising Bacchus, <lb/>
            that of wine. Whatever exploits, also, antiquity has recorded <lb/>
            as performed by them, are to receive their encomium. Parent­ <lb/>
            age, too, is a subject of panegyric in regard to the gods, as <lb/>
            when any one is a son of Jupiter; antiquity, as to those who <lb/>
            were sprung from Chaos ; and offspring, as Apollo and Diana <lb/>
            are an honour to Latona. 9. We may make it a subject of <lb/>
            praise to some that they were born immortal; and to others, <lb/>
            that they attained immortality by their merits; a kind of glory <lb/>
            which the piety of our own emperor has made an honour to the <lb/>
            present age.</p>
          <p>10. The praise of men is more varied. First of all it is <lb/>
            distinguished with respect to time, that which was before them, <lb/>
            and that in which thev themselves lived; and, in regard to those <lb/>
            who are dead, that also which followed their death. Ante­ <lb/>
            cedent to the birth of a man will be his country, parents, and <lb/>
            ancestors, to whom we may refer in two ways; for it will be <lb/>
            honourable to them either to have equalled the nobility of their <lb/>
            forefathers, or to have ennobled a humble origin by their <lb/>
            achievements. 11. Other subjects for eulogy may also sometimes <lb/>
            be found in the time that preceded a man's birth ; such as <lb/>
            occurrences, for example, that denoted his future eminence by <lb/>
            prophetic indications or auguries; as the oracles are said to <lb/>
            have foretold that the son of Thetis would be greater than his <lb/>
            father. 12. The praises of a man personally should be de­ <lb/>
            rived from the qualities of his mind, body, or external circum <lb/>
            stances. The merits of corporeal and accidental advantages <lb/>
            are of less weight than those of the mind, and may be treated <lb/>
            in many ways. Sometimes we celebrate beauty and strength <lb/>
            with honour of words, as Homer extols them in his Agamem. <lb/>
            non and Achilles. Sometimes comparative weakness may <lb/>
            contribute much to our admiration, as when Homer says that <lb/>
            Tydeus was small of stature, yet a warrior. 13. Fortune, too, <pb n="221"/>
             <note type="margin">on vn.] </note> <lb/>
            gives dignity, as in kings and princes; for in their condition <lb/>
            there is the ampler field for displaying merit; and among <lb/>
            people of other conditions, the less resources a person has, the <lb/>
            greater honour he acquires by making a praiseworthy use of <lb/>
            them. All advantages, indeed, which are external to us, and <lb/>
            which have fallen to us accidentally, are not subjects of praise <lb/>
            to a man merely because he possessed them, but only in case <lb/>
            he employed them to good purpose. 14. For wealth, and <lb/>
            power, and influence, as they offer most opportunities for good <lb/>
            or evil, afford the surest test of our morals; since we are sure <lb/>
            to be either better for them or worse.</p>
          <p>15. Praise of the good qualities of the mind is always just; <lb/>
            but more than one way may be pursued in the treatment of it; <lb/>
            for sometimes it is more honourable to follow the progress of a <lb/>
            person's life and the order of his actions; so that his natural <lb/>
            genius, shown in his early years, may be first commended, then <lb/>
            his advancement in learning, and then his course of conduct, <lb/>
            including not only what he did, but what he said; sometimes <lb/>
            it will be better to divide our praises among the several kinds <lb/>
            of virtues fortitude, justice, temperance, and others, and to <lb/>
            assign to each the honour of that which has been done under <lb/>
            its influence. 16. Which of these two methods will be the <lb/>
            more eligible for us, we shall have to consider according to our <lb/>
            subject, keeping in mind, however, that the celebration of those <lb/>
            deeds is most pleasing to the audience which the object of our <lb/>
            praise is said to have been the first to do, or to have done <lb/>
            alone, or with the aid of but few supporters; and whatever else <lb/>
            he may have effected beyond hope or expectation, and especially <lb/>
            what he has done for the good of others rather than for his <lb/>
            own.</p>
          <p>17. Of the time which follows the death of persons, it is not <lb/>
            always in our power to treat; not only because we sometimes <lb/>
            praise them while they are still living, but because few occa­ <lb/>
            sions offer on which divine honours, or public decrees, or <lb/>
            statues erected at the expense of the state, can be celebrated. <lb/>
            18. Among such subjects for eulogy, I would reckon monu­ <lb/>
            ments of genius, which may be admired through all ages ; for <lb/>
            some, like Menander,* have obtained more justice from the <lb/>
            judgment of posterity than from that of their contemporaries. <lb/>
            Children reflect glory upon their parents, cities on their <note type="footnote"> * The comic poet. See x. 1, 72 ; Aul. Gell. xvii. 4. </note> <pb n="222"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.III </note> <lb/>
            founders, laws on those who have made them, arts on their <lb/>
            inventors; and institutions also on their authors, as it was <lb/>
            appointed by Numa, for instance, that we should worship the <lb/>
            gods, and by Publicola that the consuls should lower the fasces <lb/>
            before the people.</p>
          <p>[9. The same method will be observed in censure, but so as <lb/>
            to set things in a different light; for meanness of origin has <lb/>
            been a dishonour to many ; and nobility itself has rendered <lb/>
            others more conspicuous and more odious for their vices. To <lb/>
            some, as is said to have been the case with Paris, mischief <lb/>
            which it was foretold they should cause, has produced dislike ; <lb/>
            on others, as Thersites and Irus, deformity of person, or mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, has thrown contempt. In regard to others, good <lb/>
            qualities corrupted by vices, have rendered them hateful; <lb/>
            thus we find Nireus represented by the poets as cowardly, and <lb/>
            Pleisthenes * as debauched. 20. Of the mind, too, there are as <lb/>
            many vices as virtues; and both, as in panegyric, may be <lb/>
            treated in two ways. On some men ignominy has been <lb/>
            thrown after death; as on Mælius, whose house was levelled <lb/>
            with the ground, and Marcus Manlius, whose prænomen was <lb/>
            not allowed to be borne by his posterity. 21. Of the vicious, <lb/>
            also, we hate even the parents. To founders of cities it is an <lb/>
            opprobrium to have drawn together a people noxious to those <lb/>
            around them; as was the case with the original author t of <lb/>
            the Jewish superstition ; so the laws of the Gracchi brought <lb/>
            odium on their name; and any example of vice given to posterity <lb/>
            disgraces its author, as that of the obscenity which a Persian is <lb/>
            said to have first ventured to practise with a woman of Samos.‡ <lb/>
            22. With respect to the living, also, the judgments formed of <lb/>
            them by others are proofs of their character ; and the honour <lb/>
            or dishonour shown to them proves the orator's eulogy or cen­ <lb/>
            sure to be just.</p>
          <p>23. But Aristotle thinks it of importance to the orator to <note type="footnote"> * It is uncertain who Pleisthenes was, or whether the reading be <lb/>
            sound. Some would read Cleisthenes, who is mentioned as an effemi­ <lb/>
            nate and licentious man by Aristophanes, RaiL 57, and 425 ; and by <lb/>
            Suidas. </note><note type="footnote"> t Gesner and Spalding rightly suppose that Moses is meant, not <lb/>
            Christ, as some have imagined; for Quintilian must surely have <lb/>
            known, as Gesner remarks, that the origin of the Jews was of earlier <lb/>
            date than the time of Christ. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Of this no mention is found elsewhere. Spalding. </note> <pb n="223"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            consider the place in which anything is to be commended or <lb/>
            censured ; for it makes a great difference what the manners of <lb/>
            the audience are, and what opinions are publicly entertained <lb/>
            among them ; as they will be most willing to believe that the <lb/>
            virtues which they approve are in him who is eulogized, or <lb/>
            that the vices which they hate are in him whom we censure. <lb/>
            Thus the judgment formed by the orator as to the effect of his <lb/>
            speech, even before the delivery of it, will be pretty certain. <lb/>
            24. Some praise of his audience, too, should always be <lb/>
            mingled with his remarks, (for it makes them favourably dis­ <lb/>
            posed towards him,) and, whenever it is possible, should be so <lb/>
            introduced as to strengthen his cause. A panegyric on literary <lb/>
            studies will be received with less honour at Sparta than <lb/>
            at Athens; a panegyric on patience and fortitude with <lb/>
            greater. Among some people it is honourable to live by <lb/>
            plunder -; among others to respect the laws. Frugality would <lb/>
            perhaps have been an object of hatred with the Sybarites; <lb/>
            luxury would have been the greatest of crimes among the <lb/>
            ancient Romans. 25. Similar diversity is found in individuals. <lb/>
            A judge is most favourable to a pleader when he thinks that <lb/>
            his sentiments coincide with his own. Aristotle also directs, <lb/>
            (a precept which Cornelius Celsus has since carried almost to <lb/>
            excess,) that, as there is a certain proximity of virtues and <lb/>
            vices, we should sometimes avail ourselves of words that <lb/>
            approach each other in sense, so as, for instance, to call a <lb/>
            person brave instead of rash, liberal instead of prodigal, frugal <lb/>
            instead of avaricious; or, on the contrary, the vice may be <lb/>
            put for the virtue. This is an artifice, however, which a true <lb/>
            orator, that is, a good man, will never adopt, unless he happen <lb/>
            of to be led to it by a notion promoting the public good.</p>
          <p>26. Cities are eulogized in the same way as persons ; for their <lb/>
            founder is to be considered as their parent; and antiquity con­ <lb/>
            fers much dignity on their inhabitants; as we see in regard to <lb/>
            people who are said to be sprung from the soil of their country. <lb/>
            In their transactions there are the same virtues and vices as <lb/>
            in the conduct of individuals. Some have peculiar advantages <lb/>
            to be noticed, as in their situation or defences. Citizens may <lb/>
            be an honour to them, as children to parents.</p>
          <p>27. Encomiums may also be bestowed on public works, in <lb/>
            respect to which magnificence, utility, beauty, and the architect <note type="footnote"> * See Thueyd. i. 5; Herr. Odyss. iii. 71. </note> <pb n="224"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.III </note> <lb/>
            of them, are commonly considered. Magnificence, as in <lb/>
            temples ; utility, as in walls ; beauty, and the architect, in both.</p>
          <p>Panegyrics on places are also found ; as that on Sicily in <lb/>
            Cicero *; in which we regard, in like manner, beauty and <lb/>
            utility ; beauty in maritime regions, plains, and pleasant spots ; <lb/>
            utility, in respect to healthfulness or fertility of soil. There <lb/>
            is a kind of general praise, too, for honourable sayings or <lb/>
            actions. 28. There is praise, indeed, for things of every <lb/>
            kind; for eulogies have been written on sleep and death, and <lb/>
            by physicians on certain sorts of food.</p>
          <p>While I do not admit, therefore, that this laudatory depart­ <lb/>
            ment of oratory relates only to questions concerning what is <lb/>
            honourable, I think, at the same time, that it is chiefly com­ <lb/>
            prised under quality †; though certainly all three states ‡may <lb/>
            enter into this kind of composition, and Cicero§ has observed <lb/>
            that Caius Caesar has availed himself of them in his invective <lb/>
            on Cato. But the whole of panegyrical oratory bears some <lb/>
            resemblance to deliberative, because, for the most partt <lb/>
            which is recommended in the one is praised in the other.</p>

            by some authors wholly to matters of utility. If we ought to <lb/>
            follow one sole object in it, the opinion of Cicero * would have <lb/>
            greater weight with me, who thinks that this department of <lb/>
            speaking is chiefly occupied about what is honourable t. Nor <lb/>
            do I doubt, indeed, that those who adopt the former opinion, <lb/>
            consider, according to a very noble principle, that nothing is <lb/>
            advantageous but what is honourable. 2. This notion would <lb/>
            certainly be very just, if the resolutions of the good and wise <lb/>
            were always ready to support us. But in addressing the <lb/>
            unlearned, to whom our opinions must often be delivered, and <lb/>
            especially in haranguing the people, the majority of whom are <lb/>
            ignorant, the two must be kept distinct, ‡ and we must speak <lb/>
            more in conformity with ordinary apprehension. 3. For there <lb/>
            are many who, though they may consider an action to be honour­ <lb/>
            able, do not immediately allow it to be sufficiently advanta­ <lb/>
            geous, and, led by the prospect of advantage, approve what <lb/>
            they cannot doubt to be, highly dishonourable, as the treaty <lb/>
            with the Numantines § and the passing under the yoke at the <lb/>
            defile of Caudium.||</p>
          <p>4. Nor is it sufficient to include deliberative oratory ¶ in the <lb/>
            state of quality, in which is comprised the question of what is <lb/>
            honourable and what is useful; for often, in respect to these, <lb/>
            there is room for conjecture; at times some definition is to be <lb/>
            considered;** and occasionally, too, legal inquiries †† may occur, <lb/>
            especially in reference to private proceedings, if ever a doubt <lb/>
            arises whether a thing be lawful. Of conjecture I shall speak <lb/>
            more fully a little below. ‡ ‡ 5. As to definition, meanwhile, there <lb/>
            is this question in Demosthenes, " Whether Philip should give <lb/>
            or restore §§ Halonnesus to the Athenians ?" and in Cicero, in <note type="footnote"> * De Orate ii. 82. </note><note type="footnote"> + Dignitate.] That is, honestate. Capperonier. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ We must not speak of that which is honourable as being neces­ <lb/>

            his Philippics, " What is a tumult ?"* Is there not, too, the <lb/>
            question, similar to those in judicial causes, about the statue of <lb/>
            Servius Sulpicius, " whether statues are to be erected to those <lb/>
            only who perish on an embassy by the sword ? "† 6. The delibe­ <lb/>
            rative department of oratory, therefore, (which is also called the <lb/>
            suasory,) while it consults concerning the future, inquires also <lb/>
            into the past. It has two objects, to persuade and to dissuade.</p>
          <p>An exordium, such as is usual in judicial pleadings, it does <lb/>
            not require; because whoever consults an orator is already <lb/>
            well-disposed to hear him. Yet the commencement, whatever <lb/>
            it be, ought to have some resemblance to an exordium ; for we <lb/>
            must not begin abruptly, or with whatever we may fancy, <lb/>
            because in every subject there is something naturally first. <lb/>
            7. In speaking before the senate, and, indeed, before the <lb/>
            people, the same object is to be kept in view as in addressing <lb/>
            judges, namely, that of securing the goodwill of the majority of <lb/>
            those to whom we speak. Nor is this to be thought surprising, <lb/>
            when the favour of the audience is sought even in pane­ <lb/>
            gyrics, where the purpose is not to attain any advantage, <lb/>
            but merely to bestow praise. 8. Aristotle indeed, and not <lb/>
            without reason, thinks that we may often commence, in <lb/>
            deliberative speeches, with an allusion to ourselves, or to the <lb/>
            character of him who differs in opinion from us; borrowing <lb/>
            this method, as it were, from judicial pleadings ; sometimes in <lb/>
            such a manner, that our subject may be made to appear of <lb/>
            less or greater importance than our audience imagine it.‡ 9. <lb/>
            In panegyrics, he thinks that the exordium may be allowed <lb/>
            the utmost latitude; since it is sometimes taken from something <lb/>
            foreign to the subject, as Isocrates has taken his in his oration in <lb/>
            praise of Helen ;§ or from something bordering on the subject, <note type="footnote">ejected from it, but, when the Athenians asked for possession of it, he <lb/>
            refused to give it them, saying that it was his own. The speech <lb/>
            exhorts the Athenians not <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαμάνειν αύτήν, άλλ' άπολαμανειν</foreign>, not <lb/>
            to receive it as given, but as restored to them." Libanius's Argument <lb/>

            as the same orator, in his Panegyric, complains that If more <lb/>
            honour is paid to the good qualities of the body than to those <lb/>
            of the mind and as Gorgias, in his oration at the Olympic <lb/>
            games, extols those who first instituted such meetings. <lb/>
            Sallust, following, doubtless, the example of these orators, <lb/>
            has commenced his histories of the Jugurthine War and the <lb/>
            Conspiracy of Catiline with introductions having no relation to <lb/>
            his narratives. 10. But I am now to speak of deliberative <lb/>
            oratory, in which, even when we adopt an exordium, we ought <lb/>
            to content ourselves with one that is short. resembling asit <lb/>
            were an initial chapter or statement.</p>
          <p>AS To a Regular statement of facts, a private subject of dis­ <lb/>
            cussion will never require it, at least a statement of the matter <lb/>
            on which an opinion is to be given ; for no man is ignorant of <lb/>
            the particulars on which he consults others. 11. Statements, <lb/>
            however, of many external circumstances relative to the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of deliberation may be introduced. In deliberative <lb/>
            addresses to the people a statement setting forth the orde. <lb/>
            of circumstances is indispensable. 12. Deliberative oratory <lb/>
            requires appeals to the feelings more than any other kind of <lb/>
            eloquence ; for indignation is often to be kindled and allayed; <lb/>
            and the minds of the audience are to be moved to fear. eager­ <lb/>
            ness. hatred, benevolence. Sometimes, too, pity is to be <lb/>
            exited, whether we have, for example, torecommend that aid <lb/>
            be given to a besieged town, or whether we be called upon to <lb/>
            lament the overthrow of a people in alliance with us.</p>
          <p>18. But what is of most weight in deliberative speeches is <lb/>
            authority in the speaker; for he who desires everybody to <lb/>
            Trust to his opinion about what is expedient and honourable, <lb/>
            ought to be, and to be esteemed, a man of the greatest <lb/>
            judgment and probity. In judicial pleadings it is commonly <lb/>
            thought allowable for a man to indulge, in some degree, his <lb/>
            own feelings ; but every one supposes that counsel is given by <lb/>
            a speaker in accordance with his moral principles.</p>
          <p>14. Most of the Greek rhetoricians have been of opinion <lb/>
            that the business of all this kind of oratory is with addresses <lb/>
            to the multitude, and have confined it wholly to affairs of <lb/>
            government. Even Cicero * considers it chiefly with reference <note type="footnote"> sophists, who used to treat of absurd and trifling matters in their <lb/>
            speeches. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> * Do Orat. ii. 81—83. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>

            to that department, and accordingly says that for those who <lb/>
            are to give advice concerning peace, war, levies of troops, <lb/>
            public works, or revenues, the two things chiefly to be known <lb/>
            are the resources and the manners of the people whom they <lb/>
            address ; so that his arguments may be derived at once from the <lb/>
            particular circumstances and from the character of his hearers. <lb/>
            15. To me it appears that there is greater variety in this field <lb/>
            of eloquence; for the classes of persons who consult, and the <lb/>
            kinds of advice that may be given, are extremely numerous. <lb/>
            In persuading and dissuading, then, three particulars are <lb/>
            chiefly to be regarded : what is the subject of deliberation; who <lb/>
            those that deliberate are; and what is the character of him <lb/>
            that would influence their deliberations.</p>
          <p>16. As to that which is the subject of deliberation, it is either <lb/>
            certain that it may be carried into effect, or uncertain. If it <lb/>
            be uncertain, its uncertainty will be the sole point for conside­ <lb/>
            ration, or, I should say, the chief point, for it will often happen <lb/>
            that we shall assert, first of all, that a thing, even if it could <lb/>
            be done, ought not to be done, and, next, that it cannot be <lb/>
            done. But when the question is respecting something uncer­ <lb/>
            tain, the point is conjectural,* as whether the Isthmus can be <lb/>
            cut through, or the Pontine marshes drained, † or a harbour <lb/>
            made at Ostia ?‡ Or whether Alexander was likely to find <lb/>
            lands beyond the ocean?|| 17. But even in regard to things <lb/>
            which are acknowledged to be practicable, there will some­ <lb/>
            times be room for conjecture: as if it were inquired, for <lb/>
            instance, whether it would ever happen that the Romans would <lb/>
            subdue Carthage; ; whether Hannibal would return if Scipio <lb/>
            transported his army into Africa; whether the Samnites would <lb/>
            keep faith if the Romans were to lay down their arms.§ As to <lb/>
            some things, too, it is credible both that they can be done, <lb/>
            and that they will be done, but at some other time, or in some <lb/>
            other place, or in some other manner.</p>
          <p>18. Where there is no place for conjecture other points are <note type="footnote"> * Conjectura est.] That is, status conjecturalis, or facti quœstio. Cap­ <lb/>

            to be regarded. In the first place the deliberation will be <lb/>
            held, either on account of the matter itself, on which opinions <lb/>
            are asked, or on account of some extrinsic reasons that affect <lb/>
            it. The senate deliberates, for example, with regard to <lb/>
            the matter itself, when they consider whether they shall <lb/>
            vote pay for the army.* 19. This is a simple question. <lb/>
            Reasons are adduced for doing a thing, as when the <lb/>
            senate deliberates whether they shall deliver up the Fabii <lb/>
            to the Gauls threatening war;† or for not doing it, as when <lb/>
            Julius Cæsar deliberates whether he shall persist in marching <lb/>
            into Germany, when his soldiers were everywhere making <lb/>
            their wills.‡ 20. These two questions offer more than one point <lb/>
            for consideration ; for as to the former, the reason for delibe­ <lb/>
            rating is, that the Gauls are threatening war, but a question <lb/>
            may also be raised, whether even, without such threatening, <lb/>
            those ought not to have been given up, who, being sent as ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors, had engaged in battle contrary to law, and had killed <lb/>
            the king § to whom they had received communications ? 21. <lb/>
            As to the other subject, Caesar would, doubtless, not have deli­ <lb/>
            berated at all, if it had not been for the consternation of his <lb/>
            troops ; yet there is room for inquiring whether, independently <lb/>
            of that circumstance, it would have been proper for him to pro­ <lb/>
            ceed into Germany. But we must always speak first on that <lb/>
            point which might be a subject for deliberation even if other <lb/>
            circumstances were detached from it.</p>
          <p>22. Some have thought that the topics for persuasion are <lb/>
            the three considerations what is honourable, what is useful, <lb/>
            and what is necessary. For the introduction of the third <lb/>
            I find no motive;|| for, when any force oppresses us, it <lb/>
            may be necessary for us to suffer something, but certainly not <lb/>
            to do anything ; but it is about doing that deliberation is con­ <lb/>
            cerned. 23. Or if they call that necessity to which men are <lb/>
            driven by the fear of some greater evil, the question respect­ <note type="footnote"> *Livy, v. 59, relates that the senate decreed pay for the soldiers <lb/>

            ing it will be one of expediency; as if the inhabitants of a <lb/>

            of water and provisions, deliberate about surrendering to, the <lb/>

            to destruction. In fact, the Saguutines * did not surrender, nor <lb/>
            those who were surrounded in the vessel of Opitergium.† 24. In <lb/>
            such circumstances, therefore, the question will be either con­ <lb/>
            cerning expediency, alone, or there will be hesitation between <lb/>
            what is expedient and what is honourable. But, it may be <lb/>
            said, if a man wishes to have children, he is under the neces­ <lb/>
            sity of taking a wife. Doubtless ; but he who wishes to have <lb/>
            children must first be convinced that he ought to take a wife; <lb/>
            25. and consequently there appears to me to be no place for <lb/>
            deliberation when there is necessity, any more than when it is <lb/>
            settled that a thing cannot be done; for all deliberation is <lb/>
            about something doubtful. Those, therefore, have made a better <lb/>
            distinction who have called the third head <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνατόν</foreign>, which our <lb/>
            countrymen term possibile, " possibility and though our Latin <lb/>
            term may seem uncouth, yet it is the only one to be found</p>
          <p>26. That these three considerations do not enter into every <lb/>
            subject of deliberation is too evident to make it necessary for <lb/>
            me to demonstrate. Yet by most writers the number is <lb/>
            increased; for things are reckoned by them as general con­ <lb/>
            siderations which are but special objects for notice; since what <lb/>
            is lawful, just, pious, equitable, and merciful, (mansuetum, for <lb/>
            so they interpret <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἥμεξον</foreign>,) and whatever else may be added <lb/>
            )f a similar character, may be included under what is honour­ <lb/>
            able. 27. Whether, again, a thing be easy, important, plea­ <lb/>
            sant, or free from danger, belongs to the consideration of <lb/>
            expediency. These particular points for consideration arise <lb/>
            from what is said in reply to us by our opponents : It is indeed <lb/>
            expedient, but it is difficult, of little importance, unpleasant, <lb/>
            and dangerous. 28. Yet some think that deliberation at times <lb/>
            occurs concerning agreeableness merely; as when a consulta­ <lb/>
            tion is held about the erection of a theatre, or the institution <note type="footnote"> *Liv. xxi. 14 ; Sil. Ital. ii. 696. </note><note type="footnote"> t See Flor. ii. 33; Lucan, iv. 462 seqq. They put one another to <lb/>
            death. </note> <pb n="231"/>
            <note type="margin"> On. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            of games; but I do not suppose that any man is so totally <lb/>
            given up to pleasure as to look in a subject for deliberation to <lb/>
            nothing but gratification. 29. For there must always be some­ <lb/>
            thing that should be thought of higher consideration ; as in <lb/>
            regard to games, the honour of the gods; in regard to the erec­ <lb/>
            tion of a theatre, useful relaxation from labour, and the unbe­ <lb/>
            coming and inconvenient contention for places among the <lb/>
            crowd, if there should be no theatre; and religion, at the same <lb/>
            time, will have its place in the consideration, as we may call <lb/>
            the theatre a temple, as it were, for the festival solemnized <lb/>
            there to the gods.</p>
          <p>30. Often, too, we say that advantage is to be disregarded, <lb/>
            in order that we may do what is honourable; (as when we <lb/>
            counsel the people of Opitergium not to surrender themselves <lb/>
            to the enemy, though they will perish unless they do so ;) and <lb/>
            sometimes we may have occasion to set what is honourable <lb/>
            below what is advantageous; (as when we advise, as in the <lb/>
            second Punic war, that the slaves should be armed ;*) 31. <lb/>
            though even in the latter case we must not altogether admit <lb/>
            that the proceeding is dishonourable; (for we may say that all <lb/>
            men are free by nature, and are formed of the same matter, <lb/>
            and that some even of the slaves may be descended from <lb/>
            noble ancestors;) and, in the former case, when the danger is <lb/>
            evident, other considerations may be alleged, as we may assert <lb/>
            that, if they surrender, they may perish even more cruelly, <lb/>
            should the enemy, for instance, not keep their word, or should <lb/>
            Cæsar, as is more probable, obtain the superiority. 32. But <lb/>
            considerations which are so much opposed to one another, are <lb/>
            frequently softened by some alteration in the words; for expe­ <lb/>
            diency itself is altogether set at nought by that sect t who say <lb/>
            not only that what is honourable is always preferable to what <lb/>
            is expedient, but that nothing can even be expedient which is <lb/>
            not honourable; while, on the other hand, what we call <lb/>
            honourable, another sect ‡ calls vain, ostentatious, foolish, and <lb/>
            more commendable in words than in reality.</p>
          <p>33. Nor is what is advantageous compared only with what <lb/>
            is disadvantageous, but things that are advantageous or disad­ <lb/>
            vantageous are compared with one another; as when we try to <note type="footnote"> * After the battle of Cannæ: Florus, ii. 6; Livy, XXII 57. </note><note type="footnote"> + The Stoics. Gallœus. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The Epicureans. Gallœus. </note> <pb n="232"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IIL </note> <lb/>
            determine, of two advantageous measures, which is the mure <lb/>
            advantageous, or of two that are disadvantageous, which is the <lb/>
            less so. The difficulty may be still increased ; for sometimes <lb/>
            three subjects for deliberation may present themselves ; as <lb/>
            when Pompey deliberated* whether he should betake himself <lb/>
            to Parthia. or Africa, or Egypt. Thus it is not only inquired <lb/>
            which of two courses is preferable, but which is the most eligi <lb/>
            ble of three. 34. In questions of this kind, there will never <lb/>
            occur any doubt as to a matter which is every way in our <lb/>
            favour; for when there is no room for speaking against a <lb/>
            measure what motive can there be for hesitating about it ? <lb/>
            Thus every subject for deliberation is generally nothing else <lb/>
            but a subject for comparison ; and we must consider, both <lb/>
            what ice would attain and by what means, so that we may form <lb/>
            an estimate whether there is greater advantage in that which we <lb/>
            pursue, or greater disadvantage in the means by which we pursue it. <lb/>
            35. A question of advantage may also have reference to time: <lb/>
            it is expedient, but not now ; or to place: not here; or to per­ <lb/>
            sons : not for us, or against those ; or to a particular mode of <lb/>
            proceeding: not thus ; or to measure: not to so great a degree.</p>
          <p>But we have still more frequently to take persons! into con­ <lb/>
            sideration, with a view to what may be becoming; a point <lb/>
            which is to be regarded in respect not only to ourselves but to <lb/>
            those also who consult us. 36. Though examples, therefore, <lb/>
            are of the utmost effect in deliberative oratory, because men <lb/>
            are most easily led to consent to any measure by instances of <lb/>
            similar proceedings, yet it makes a great difference whose <lb/>
            authority is adduced, and to whom it is recommended ; for the <lb/>
            feelings of those who listen to deliberative speeches are <lb/>
            various. 37. Our audience may be also of two kinds; for <lb/>
            those who consult us, are either many, or single individuals; <lb/>
            and, as to each, distinctions are to be made; since, with regard <lb/>
            to a number of persons, it makes a great difference whether they <lb/>
            are a senate, or a people, whether Romans, or Fidenates, whether <lb/>
            Greeks, or Barbarians ; and, in respect to individuals, whether <lb/>
            we recommend that public offices should be sought by Cato or <lb/>
            by Caius Marius, and whether Scipio the elder, or Fabius con <note type="footnote"> * After the battle of Pharsalia ; see Plutarch. Vit. Pomp.; Lucan, <lb/>
            VIII. 256 seqq. </note><note type="footnote"> t He now enters on the second part of the division which he mads <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH.VIII. </note> <lb/>
            suit with us on the mode of conducting a war.* 38. We must <lb/>
            in like manner look to sex, dignity, and age. But it is the <lb/>
            character of our hearers that should lead us to make the chief <lb/>
            difference in our addresses to them. To recommend honour­ <lb/>
            able measures to those who are honourable is extremely easy ; <lb/>
            but if we ever have occasion to enforce a right course of con­ <lb/>
            duct on the unprincipled, we must be careful not to reproach <lb/>
            them with the opposite nature of their life. 39. The minds <lb/>
            of such an audience are to be influenced, not by dissertations <lb/>
            on the nature of virtue, for which they have no regard, but by <lb/>
            allusions to honour, and to the opinion of others, and if such <lb/>
            arguments to their vanity do not move them, by showing <lb/>
            the advantage likely to follow from what you advise, or rather <lb/>
            perhaps, and with more effect, by showing them how much is <lb/>
            to be dreaded if they act otherwise. 40. For besides the fact <lb/>
            that minds of the lightest principles are most easily alarmed, <lb/>
            I know not whether the fear of evil has not naturally more <lb/>
            influence with the majority of mankind than the hope of good ; <lb/>
            to whom also the knowledge of what is vicious comes with <lb/>
            greater facility than the knowledge of that which is virtuous. <lb/>
            41. Sometimes also actions which are scarcely honourable are <lb/>
            recommended to the good ; and to those of a rather opposite <lb/>
            character are proposed measures in which nothing but the <lb/>
            advantage of those who seek the advice is regarded.</p>
          <p>I am well aware what sort of reflection may at once occur <lb/>
            to the reader of this passage. "Is this, then," he may ask, <lb/>
            " the practice that you recommend ?f and do you think it <lb/>
            right?" 42. Cicero might absolve me, who writes in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing manner to Brutus,‡ (after mentioning many courses of <lb/>
            conduct which might be fairly recommended to Cæsar,§) <lb/>
            should I act as an honest man, if I should recommend these <lb/>
            measures ? Certainly not; for the proper object of an adviser <lb/>
            is the advantage of him whom he advises. But the measures <lb/>
            are right. Who says otherwise ? But in giving advice there is <note type="footnote"> * In Livy, XXXVIII. 40, Scipio and Fabius deliberate an the mode of <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.III. </note> <lb/>
            not always room for what is right. As this question, however, <lb/>
            is of a deeper nature, and does not concern deliberative <lb/>
            speeches only, the subject is reserved by me for my twelfth <lb/>
            book,. which will be my last. 43. I should not wish anything <lb/>
            to be done dishonourably ;† and, in the meantime, let these <lb/>
            questions be considered to belong at least to the exercises of <lb/>
            the schools; for the nature of what is bad should be known, <lb/>
            that we may the better support what is good.</p>
          <p>44. If any one, however, recommend to a good man any­ <lb/>
            thing not quite honourable, let him remember not to recom­ <lb/>
            mend it as dishonourable, in the manner in which some <lb/>
            declaimers urge Sextus Pompey to engage in piracy, for the <lb/>
            very reason that it is nefarious and cruel; but some palliation <lb/>
            must be thrown over what is disgraceful, even in addressing <lb/>
            the immoral. 45. It is in this way that Catiline speaks in <lb/>
            Sallust, ‡ so that he seems to rush daringly into a heinous <lb/>
            enterprise, not through want of regard for honesty, but <lb/>
            through indignation. It is thus also that Atreus speaks in <lb/>
            Varius: § <lb/>
            " I now endure gross wickedness, and now <lb/>
            I'm forc'd to act it."</p>
          <p>How much more then is this pretension to honour to be <lb/>
            maintained before those who have a real regard to their cha­ <lb/>
            racter ! 46. Accordingly, if we advise Cicero to implore the <lb/>
            mercy of Antony, or even to burn his Philippics, (supposing <lb/>
            such to be the condition on which Antony offers him life,||) we <lb/>
            shall not insist upon his love of life, (for if this has any influ. <lb/>
            ence on his mind, it will maintain that influence even though <lb/>
            we remain silent,) but we shall exhort him to preserve himself <lb/>
            for the service of his country. 47. He will have occasion for <lb/>
            such a pretext, that he may not be ashamed of his suppli­ <note type="footnote"> * See the whole of the twelfth chapter. </note><note type="footnote"> + Nee ego quicquam fieri turpiter velim.] Though a dishonourable <lb/>

            cations to Antony. Or if we advise Cams Cæsar* to assume <lb/>
            kingly power, we shall assert that the state cannot subsist but <lb/>
            under the rule of one master; for he who deliberates about a <lb/>
            criminal proceeding. seeks only how he may appear to do as <lb/>
            little wrong as possible.</p>
          <p>48. It is of much importance, also, what the character of <lb/>
            the adviser is; because, if his previous life has been illus­ <lb/>
            trious, or if the nobility of his birth, or his age or fortune, ex­ <lb/>
            cites expectation, care must be taken that what he says may <lb/>
            not be at variance with the dignity of him who says it; but <lb/>
            a character of a contrary nature requires a humbler tone; for <lb/>
            what is liberty in some, is, in others, called presumption; to <lb/>
            some their authority is sufficient support, while the force of <lb/>
            reason itself scarcely upholds others.</p>
          <p>49. In consequence prosopopeiæ t appear to me the most <lb/>
            difficult of all speeches of this kind; for in them the task of <lb/>
            sustaining a character is added to the other arduous points of <lb/>
            suasory eloquence. Cæsar, Cicero, and Cato, speaking on the <lb/>
            same subject, must each express himself differently. But <lb/>
            exercise in this department is extremely beneficial, both <lb/>
            because it requires double effort,‡ and because it greatly <lb/>
            improves the powers of those who would be poets or historians. <lb/>
            50. To orators it is even indispensable; for there are many <lb/>
            speeches composed by Greek and Latin orators for others to <lb/>
            use, to whose condition and character what was expressed in <lb/>
            them was to be adapted. Did Cicero think uniformly in the <lb/>
            same manner, or assume the same character, when he wrote <lb/>
            for Cneius Pompey, for Titus Ampius, and for others ? Did <lb/>
            he not rather, looking to the fortune, dignity, and actions of <lb/>
            each of them, express the very character of all to whom he <lb/>
            gave words, so that, though they spoke in a better style than <lb/>
            their own, they yet appeared to speak in their own persons ? <note type="footnote"> * Augustus. See the arguments used by Agrippa and Mæenas, to <lb/>

          <p>It ought, indeed, to be a chief object with declaimers to <lb/>
            consider what is suitable to different characters; for they <lb/>
            speak on but few subjects of controversy as advocates,! but <lb/>
            generally harangue in the character of sons, fathers, rich men, <lb/>
            old men, morose or good-natured persons, misers or super­ <lb/>
            stitious people, cowards or jesters; so that actors in comedy <lb/>
            have scarcely more parts to master on the stage than they <lb/>
            have in the schools. 52. All these representations of charac­ <lb/>
            ters may be regarded as prosopopeiœ, which I include under <lb/>
            deliberative orations, because they differ from them in nothing <lb/>
            but the personation of a character, though this is sometimes <lb/>
            introduced into those deliberative subjects, which, taken from <lb/>
            history, are conducted under the real names of the speakers. <lb/>
            53. Nor am I ignorant that poetical and historical prosopopeiœ <lb/>
            are sometimes given in the schools by way of exercise; as the <lb/>
            pleading of Priam before Achilles, or the address of Sylla to <lb/>
            the people on laying down the dictatorship. But these will <lb/>
            fall under some of the three heads into which I have divided <lb/>
            causes; for we have to intreat, to make declarations, to give <lb/>
            reasons, and to do other things of which I have spoken above,‡ <lb/>
            in various forms and as the subject may require, both in the <lb/>
            judicial, and in the deliberative, and in the demonstrative, <lb/>
            kind of oratory. 54. But in all these § we very often utter <lb/>
            fictitious speeches attributed to characters which we ourselves <lb/>

            schools, which approach nearer to the judicial than the delibe­ <lb/>
            rative kind of oratory, and which are indeed compounded of <lb/>
            the two; as when a discussion is held before Cæsar about the <lb/>
            punishment of Theodotus; † for it consists of an accusation and <lb/>
            a defence, which are the proper parts of judicial pleadings. <lb/>
            56. But the question of expediency also enters into it; it is in­ <lb/>
            quired whether it was to the advantage of Cæsar that Pompey <lb/>
            was killed; whether war is to be apprehended from the king if <lb/>
            Theodotus be put to death; whether such war would not be <lb/>
            embarrassing and dangerous at the present time, and likely to be <lb/>
            of long duration. 57. Considerations also arise about the <lb/>
            honourableness of the proceeding: as whether it would be <lb/>
            becoming in Cæsar to avenge Pompey; whether it was to be <lb/>
            apprehended that he would injure the cause of his party, if he <lb/>
            should confess that Pompey was undeserving of death. 58. De­ <lb/>
            liberations on such questions may occur even in real causes. ‡</p>
          <p>There has, however, prevailed among most declaimers, in <lb/>
            regard to deliberative speeches, an error that has not been <lb/>
            without its consequences; for they have imagined that the <lb/>
            deliberative style of speaking is different from the judicial, and <lb/>
            indeed altogether opposed to it; and they have accordingly <lb/>
            affected abrupt commencements, a kind of oratory always <lb/>
            vehement, and a liberal embellishment, as they call it,§ in <lb/>

            forsooth, for deliberative than for judicial subjects. 59. For <lb/>
            my part, though I do not see that there is any need for a <lb/>
            regular exordium in deliberative speeches for the reasons <lb/>
            which I have previously stated,* I still do not understand <lb/>
            why we should commence with furious exclamation; for he who <lb/>
            is asked his opinion on a question proposed, does not, if he is <lb/>
            a man of sense, begin immediately to cry out, but endeavours <lb/>
            to gain the confidence of those who consult him by a modest <lb/>
            and rational entrance on the subject. 60. Or why should the <lb/>
            style of the speaker be like a torrent, and uniformly vehe­ <lb/>
            ment, when counsel requires in the most eminent degree <lb/>
            moderation and calm reasoning? I admit that, in judicial <lb/>
            pleadings, the tone of the speaker is often lowered in the <lb/>
            exordium, the statement of facts, and the argumentative <lb/>
            portions, and that, if you take away these three parts, there <lb/>
            will remain something like the substance of which deliberative <lb/>
            orations consist, but that substance ought to be more calm, not <lb/>
            more violent and furious.</p>
          <p>61. As to grandeur of diction, it is not to be affected by <lb/>
            those who declaim deliberative speeches more than by <lb/>
            others ; but it comes more naturally to them; for to those who <lb/>
            imagine their own subjects, great personages are generally <lb/>
            most attractive, such as those of kings, princes, people, senates, <lb/>
            with important topics for discussion; and thus, when the style <lb/>
            is suited to the matter, it assumes a degree of magnificence <lb/>
            from it 62. With regard to real causes the case is different, <lb/>
            and therefore Theophrastus † has pronounced that the language <lb/>
            in all deliberative oratory should be free from every kind of <lb/>
            affectation; following in this respect the authority of his <lb/>
            master,! though he does not hesitate frequently to differ from <lb/>
            him ; 63. for Aristotle was of opinion § that the panegyrical <lb/>

            devoted wholly to display, and the latter requires art so as <lb/>
            even to deceive the hearers if expediency demands; but counsel <lb/>
            needs nothing but truth and prudence. 64. With these <lb/>
            critics in respect to panegyric, I agree; for all other writers <lb/>
            have expressed themselves of a similar opinion; but in judicial <lb/>
            and deliberative subjects I think that the manner of speaking <lb/>
            is to be adaptedto the matter, according to the nature of the <lb/>
            question that may be under consideration. 65. I see that the <lb/>
            Philippics of Demosthenes are distinguished by the same <lb/>
            merits as the speeches which he pronounced in judicial causes; <lb/>
            and the opinions of Cicero delivered in the senate, and his <lb/>
            speeches to the people, exhibit a splendour of eloquence not less <lb/>
            luminous than that which appears in his accusations and de­ <lb/>
            fences. Yet he speaks of the deliberative kind of oratory in <lb/>
            this way :* The language ought to be uniformly simple and <lb/>
            grave, and more distinguished for studied thoughts than for <lb/>
            studied phraseology. 66. That there is no kind of oratory <lb/>
            to which the application of examples is more suitable, all <lb/>
            writers are justly agreed, as the future seems for the most <lb/>
            part to correspond to the past, and experience is regarded as <lb/>
            some attestation to reason.</p>
          <p>67. As to shortness or length in such speeches, it depends, <lb/>
            not on the nature of the subject,† but on the compass of it; <lb/>
            for as in deliberations the question is generally more simple, <lb/>
            so in judicial affairs it is often of less extent.‡</p>
          <p>All these remarks he will find to be true, who shall prefer, <lb/>
            instead of growing grey over the treatises of the rhetoricians, <lb/>
            t to read, not speeches only, but also histories; for in history <lb/>
            the orations pronounced to the people, and the opinions de­ <lb/>
            livered in councils of state, generally afford examples of <lb/>
            persuasion and dissuasion. 68. He will find, too, that in <lb/>
            deliberative speeches the commencements are not abrupt; <lb/>
            that the diction in judicial pleadings is often more animated; <note type="footnote"> * Partition. Oratoriæ, c. 27 fin. </note><note type="footnote"> + Genere materiæ.] Whether it be demonstrative, deliberative, or <lb/>

          <p>Of judicial oratory; the departments of it often injudiciously increased; <lb/>
            the proper number is five, § 1—6. The order to be observed in <lb/>
            speaking and writing, 7—9.</p>
          <p>1. I AM now to speak of the judicial kind of oratory, which <lb/>
            is extremely varied, but lies in the two duties of attack and <lb/>
            defence The divisions of it, as most authors are of opinion, <lb/>
            are inve tne exordium, the statement of facts, the proof of <lb/>
            what we advance, the refutation of our adversary, and the <lb/>
            peroration. 2. To these some have added partition, proposition, <lb/>
            and digression; the first two of which evidently fall under <lb/>
            proof; for you must necessarily propose what you are going to <lb/>
            prove, as well as conclude after you have proved; and, if pro­ <lb/>
            position is a division of a cause, why is not also conclusion ?* As <lb/>
            for partition, it is only one of the duties of arrangement, which is <lb/>
            a portion of oratory in general, equally pervading all its parts and <lb/>
            the whole body of each, like invention and delivery. 3. We are. <lb/>
            therefore, not to consider partition as one division of a speech <note type="footnote"> * Which no writer on oratory has yet considered as a division of it <lb/>
            Spalding. </note> <pb n="241"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.IX.] </note> <lb/>
            taken as a whole, but as belonging to every single question in <lb/>
            it; for what question is there in which the orator may not <lb/>
            state what he is going to say in the first place, what in the <lb/>
            second, and what in the third; and this is the business of <lb/>
            partition. How ridiculous is it then, that each question <lb/>
            should be a species of proof, and that partition, which is <lb/>
            but a species of question, should be called a part of the <lb/>
            speech as a whole ? 4. But as for digression, or, what has <lb/>
            become a more common term, excessus, “ excursion," if it be <lb/>
            without the cause, it cannot be a part of the cause ; and, if it <lb/>
            be within the cause, it is an aid or ornament to the parts from <lb/>
            which it proceeds ; for if whatever is in the cause is to be <lb/>
            called a part of the cause, why is not every argument, com­ <lb/>
            parison, common place, address to the feelings, and example, <lb/>
            called a part of the cause ?</p>
          <p>6. I do not, however, agree with those who, like oe* <lb/>
            omit refutation, as comprehende. under proof; for proof <lb/>
            establlshes, refutation overthrows. Aristotle t also makes an <lb/>
            innovation to a certain degree, by placing next to the exordium, <lb/>
            not the statement of facts, but the proposition; but this he <lb/>
            does because he thinks the proposition the genus, and the <lb/>
            statement of facts the species ; and supposes that there is not <lb/>
            always a necessity for the first, but for the second always and <lb/>
            in all cases.</p>
          <p>6. But with regard to the divisions which I have made, it is <lb/>
            not to be understood that that which is to be delivered first is <lb/>
            necessarily to be contemplated first for we ought to consider, <lb/>
            before everything else, of what nature the cause is; what is <lb/>
            the question in it; what may profit or injure it ; next, what is <lb/>
            to be maintained or refuted; and then, how the statement of <lb/>
            facts should be made. 7. For the statement § is preparatory to <lb/>
            proof, and cannot be made to advantage, unless it be first <lb/>
            settled what it ought to promise as to proof. Last of all, it is <lb/>
            to be considered how the judge is to be conciliated; for, until <lb/>
            all the bearings of the cause be ascertained, we cannot know <lb/>
            what sort of feeling it is proper to excite in the judge, whether <note type="footnote"> * Rhet. ii. 26, 3 ; iiL 13, 4; 17, 14. </note><note type="footnote"> t Rhet. iii.

          <p>8, Yet, I do not, on these accounts, agree with those who <lb/>
            think that the exordium is to be written last ;* for though it <lb/>
            is proper that our materials should be collected, and that we <lb/>
            should settle what effect is to be produced by each particular, <lb/>
            before we begin to speak or write, yet we ought certainly to <lb/>
            begin with that which is naturally first. 9. No man begins <lb/>
            to paint a portraît, or mould a statue, with the feet; nor does <lb/>
            any art find its completion where the commencement ought <lb/>
            to be. Else what will be the case if we have no time to write <lb/>
            our speech ? Will not so preposterous a practice disappoint <lb/>
            us ? The orator's materials are, therefore, to be first contem. <lb/>
            plated in the order in which we direct,! and then to be written <lb/>

          <p>A cause rests either on one point of controversy, or on several; on <lb/>
            points of the same or of different kinds, § 1, 2. Comparison, <lb/>
            3, 4. We must first settle the kind of cause; what points are to <lb/>
            be considered next, 5.</p>
          <p>1. EVERY cause, in which there is one method for a plaintiff, <lb/>
            and another for a defendant, consists either in a controversy <lb/>
            about one charge or about several. The one is called simple, <lb/>
            the other complex. A question about a theft by itself , or an <lb/>
            act of adultery by itself is single and independent. When <lb/>
            there are several questions, they may be either of the same <lb/>
            kind, as in a charge of extortion ; or of different kinds, as in <lb/>
            a charge of sacrilege and homicide at the same time. This <lb/>
            union of charges does not now t occur in public trials, because <lb/>
            the prætor takes cognizance of each according to a fixed law, <lb/>
            but is frequent in the causes tried before the emperors and the <lb/>
            senate, and used to be common in those that came before the <lb/>
            people; and disputes between private individuals often require <note type="footnote"> * Antonius, in Cicero de Oratore, mentions this as his practice. </note><note type="footnote"> t Prœcipimus.] Ad ipsum Fabium pertinet.

            one judge to determine as to many different points of law. <lb/>
            2. Nor will there be more than two kinds of causes, even in <lb/>
            cases wnere one party prosecutes the same suit, and on the <lb/>
            same ground, against several; or two against one ; or several <lb/>
            against several; as we sometimes see occur in actions about <lb/>
            inheritances; because, though there be several parties, the <lb/>
            cause is still but one, unless indeed the condition. of the <lb/>
            parties give rise to distinct questions.</p>
          <p>3. There is, however, said to be a third kind, different from <lb/>
            these, called comparative; and some consideration with regard <lb/>
            to comparison frequently happens in some part of a cause ; as <lb/>
            when, in a case before the centumviri, there arises, after other <lb/>
            questions, one of this kind, which of two persons is better enti­ <lb/>
            tied to an inheritance ? But it seldom happens that trials are <lb/>
            appointed in the forum t merely for that object, and only in <lb/>
            cases of divination, which take place for the purpose of appoint­ <lb/>
            ing an accuser, or sometimes between informers to decide which <lb/>

          <p>4. To this number some have indeed added a fourth, called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντϰατηγοία</foreign>, “ recrimination," or mutual accusation; but <lb/>
            others think that this is comprehended under the comparative <lb/>
            kind; and the case of reciprocal suits t will be similar to it; a <lb/>
            case which happens very frequently; and if this ought also to be <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιϰατηγοία</foreign>, (for it has no proper appellation with us,) <lb/>
            there will be two kinds of it, one in which the parties bring <lb/>
            the same charge against each other ; the other in which they <lb/>
            bring different charges. The case is similar with regard to <lb/>

          <p>1. WHEN these matters are settled, Hermagoras thinks that <lb/>
            we must next consider what is the question, the mode of defence,§ <lb/>
            the point for judgment,|| the or point “containing” the <lb/>
            accusation, or, as some call it it, the firmamentum, or "founda­ <lb/>
            tion " of the cause.</p>
          <p>Question, in its more general sense, is understood to mean every­ <lb/>
            thing on which two or more plausible opinions maybe advanced. <lb/>
            2. But in regard to judicial matters, it is to be taken in two <lb/>
            senses; one, when we say that a cause involves several ques­ <lb/>
            tions, among which we include even those of least importance; <lb/>
            the other, when we mean the great question on which a cause <lb/>
            turns. It is of the second that I now speak, and it is from <lb/>
            this that the state has its origin: Has a thing been done ?** <lb/>
            What has been done ?tt Has it been justifiably done ?‡‡ 3 <lb/>
            These interrogatories Hermagoras, Apollodorus, and many <lb/>
            other writers, call properly questions; Theodorus, as I observed,§§ <note type="footnote"> * Status qualitatis. </note><note type="footnote"> t Status definitivus. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Status translativus. </note> <note type="footnote">§ Ratio.] "Moyen de defense.” Gedoyn.

            terms them general heads, and the minor questions, or those <lb/>
            dependent on them, special heads; as it admitted that one <lb/>
            question may arise from another question, and that a species. <lb/>
            may be divided into species. 4. This principal question of <lb/>
            all, then, they call the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξήτημα</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The mode of defence is that process by which what is <lb/>
            admitted to have been done is justified. To exemplify it, why <lb/>
            should I not use that instance which almost all writers have <lb/>
            adopted? Orestes killed his mother: this is admitted; he <lb/>
            says that he killed her justly : the state will then be that of <lb/>
            quality ; the question, Whether he killed her justly : the ground <lb/>
            of defence will be that Clytemnestra killed her husband, the <lb/>
            father of Orestes : this is called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴτιον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The point for judgment, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰινόμενον</foreign>, will be, in this case, <lb/>
            whether even a mother guilty of such a crime ought to be killed <lb/>
            by her son.</p>
          <p>5. Some have made a distinction between <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴτιον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτία</foreign>, <lb/>
            making the, first signify the cause for which a trial becomes <lb/>
            necessary, as the killing of Clytemnestra; the second, the <lb/>
            ground on which the deed is justified, as the killing of Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon. But such has been the disagreement as to the <lb/>
            sense of these words, that some call <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτία</foreign> the cause of the <lb/>
            trial, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴτιον</foreign> the cause of the deed, while others use them <lb/>
            in senses exactly contrary. Among the Latins some have <lb/>
            adopted the terms initium, “ commencement,” and ratio, <lb/>
            “ reason;” some include both under the same term. 6. <lb/>
            Cause also appears to arise from cause, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴτιον ἐξ αἰτίου</foreign>, as, <lb/>
            Clytemnestra killed Agamemnon because he had sacrificed their <lb/>
            common daughter, and brought home a captive as his concubine. <lb/>
            The same authors are of opinion that in one question there <lb/>
            may be several grounds of defence ; as, for example, if Orestes <lb/>
            adds another cause for having killed his mother, namely, that <lb/>
            he was forced to obey an oracle; and that, whatever number <lb/>
            of causes for the deed may be alleged, there are the same <lb/>
            number of points for judgment; as it will also be a point for <lb/>
            judgment whether he ought to have obeyed the oracle. 7. But <lb/>
            even one alleged cause for a deed may, as I conceive, give rise <lb/>
            to several questions and points for judgment; as in the case <note type="footnote"> * Logicians divide a species into individuals, but deny that it can <lb/>
            be divided into other species, unless it be put in the sense of genus, <lb/>
            .... in which sense Quintilian seems to use it nere. Regius. </note> <pb n="246"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. in. </note> <lb/>
            of the man, who, after he had killed his wife on catching her in <lb/>
            adultery, subsequently killed the adulterer, who at first escaped, <lb/>
            in the forum; for the alleged cause for the deed is but one, lie <lb/>
            was an adulterer; but several questions and points for judg­ <lb/>
            ment may arise, as whether it was lawful to kill him at that <lb/>
            time, or in that place. 8. But as, when there are several <lb/>
            questions, and all have their states, there is yet but one state <lb/>
            in the cause to which everything is referred, so there is but <lb/>
            one proper point for judgment, on which the decision is <lb/>
            pronounced.</p>
          <p>9. As to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνέχον</foreign>, (which, as I said, some call continens, <lb/>
            others firmamentum, and Cicero * the strongest argument of the <lb/>
            defender, and the fittest point for adjudication,) some regard <lb/>
            it as that after which nothing remains to be ascertained; some, <lb/>
            as that which is the strongest point for adjudication. 10. The <lb/>
            reason of the deed is not a point for consideration in all causes; <lb/>
            for what reason for the deed need be sought, when the deed is <lb/>
            altogether denied ? But when the reason of the deed is an <lb/>
            object of consideration, they deny that the ultimate point for <lb/>
            decision rests on the same ground as the first question ; an <lb/>
            observation which Cicero makes both in his Rhetorica t and <lb/>
            his Partitiones. 11. For, when it is said, It was done; it <lb/>
            was not done ; was it done ? the question rests on conjecture, <lb/>
            and the judication rests on the same ground as the question, <lb/>
            because the first question and the ultimate decision are about <lb/>
            the same point. But when it is said, Orestes killed his mother; <lb/>
            he killed her justly ; no, but unjustly ; did he kill her justly ? <lb/>
            the question rests on the consideration of quality; but this is <lb/>
            not yet the point for decision. When then will it be ? After <lb/>
            the statement, She had killed my father; but you ought not, <lb/>
            therefore, to have killed your mother; ought Orestes to have <lb/>
            killed her? here is the point for decision. 12. The funda­ <lb/>
            mental point of the defence I will give in the words of Cicero § <lb/>
            himself: “ if Orestes were inclined to say that the disposition <lb/>
            of his mother towards his father, towards himself and his <lb/>
            sisters, towards his kingdom, and towards the reputation of <lb/>
            his race and family, had been of such a nature that her children <lb/>
            felt of all people most obliged to inflict punishment on <lb/>
            her." 13. Others also use such examples as these : the law <lb/>
            says, let him who has exhausted his patrimony not be allowed <note type="footnote"> * Inv i. 14. </note><note type="footnote">t Inv. i 14. </note><note type="footnote">‡ a SO. </note><note type="footnote">§ Inv. i. 14. </note> <pb n="247"/>
            <note type="margin"> tHe XI.] </note> <lb/>
            to address the people; but the defendant exhausted his upon <lb/>
            public works; and the question then is, whether whoever has <lb/>
            exhausted his patrimony is not to be allowed ; and the point <lb/>
            for judgment, whether he who has exhausted his patrimony in <lb/>
            such a way is not to be allowed. 14. Or the case of the <lb/>
            Auruncan soldiery who killed the tribune Caius Lusius, when <lb/>
            he made dishonourable advances to him, in which the question <lb/>
            is, whether he killed him justly ; the ground of defence, that he <lb/>
            made dishonourable advances; the point for judgment, whether <lb/>
            it were lawful for a person to be killed uncondemned; whether <lb/>
            it were lawful for a tribune to be killed by a soldier.</p>
          <p>15. Some also regard the question, as in one state, and the point <lb/>
            for decision in another ; the question whether Milo did right in <lb/>
            killing Clodius, is in the state of quality;† the point for decision, <lb/>
            whether Clodius lay in waitfor Milo, is in the state of conjecture.‡ <lb/>
            16. They say also that a cause often strays into some matter <lb/>
            which does not properly belong to the question, and on which <lb/>
            the decision is pronounced. I am not at all of their opinion ; for <lb/>
            the question, for instance, whether every man who has exhausted <lb/>
            his patrimony is forbidden to address the people, must have its <lb/>
            decision ; and, therefore, the question and the point for decision <lb/>
            will not be different; but there will be more than one ques­ <lb/>
            tion, and more than one point for decision. 17. In the case of <lb/>
            Milo, too, is not the question of fact considered with reference <lb/>
            to the question of quality ? for if Clodius lay in wait, it follows <lb/>
            that he was justly killed. But when the cause goes into some <lb/>
            other matter, and recedes from the question which was first <lb/>
            proposed, the question will be in the state in which the point <lb/>
            for decision is.</p>
          <p>18. Respecting these matters even Cicero is in some degree at <lb/>
            variance with himself; for in his Rhetorica, as I said above,§ <lb/>
            he has followed Hermagoras; in his Topical he expresses <note type="footnote"> * The story is noticed by Cicero Pro Mil. c. 4, and Val. Max. vi. 1, <lb/>
            12, and is related at length by Plutarch in his Life of Marius. Plutarch <lb/>
            calls the soldier Trebonius; Valerius calls him Caius Plotius. It is <lb/>
            also mentioned in the third of the declamations attributed to Quin­ <lb/>
            tilian. Of what country the soldier was a native no other author <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[B.III. </note> <lb/>
            himself of opinion that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰινόμενον</foreign>, the point of judgment, is <lb/>
            the consideration arising from the state ; and in addressing Tre­ <lb/>
            batius, a lawyer of his time, he calls it the point about which <lb/>
            the discussion is, and terms the particulars in which that <lb/>
            point is contained continentia, the containing particulars;" <lb/>
            the firmamenta, " supports" as it were of the defence, without <lb/>
            which there would be no defence at all. 19. But in his Partitiones <lb/>
            Oratoriæ* he calls the firmamentum that which is opposed to <lb/>
            the defence; because the continens, the “ containing point," as it <lb/>
            is the first thing, is advanced by the accuser; while the ratio, <lb/>
            “ mode of defence," proceeds from the defendant; and from <lb/>
            the opposition of the ratio and firmamentum arises the question <lb/>
            for decision.</p>
          <p>Those authors, therefore, have settled the matter more <lb/>
            judiciously and concisely, who have made the state, and the <lb/>
            containing point, and the question for decision, to be all the <lb/>
            same, and have pronounced the containing point to be that <lb/>
            without which there would be no discussion. 20. In this <lb/>
            “containing point" they seem to me to have included both <lb/>
            allegations, that Orestes killed his mother, and that Clytem­ <lb/>
            nestra killed Agamemnon. The same writers think that the <lb/>
            state and the point for judgment always concur ; and indeed <lb/>
            any other opinion would have been at variance with their <lb/>
            views.</p>
          <p>21. But this studied subtilty about names of things is but <lb/>
            ostentatious labour, and has only been noticed by me that I <lb/>
            might not appear to have given too little consideration to the <lb/>
            work which I have taken in hand; but a master who teaches <lb/>
            without affectation need not split his mode of teaching into <lb/>
            such minute distinctions. 22. Excessive subdivision is a fault <lb/>
            into which many rhetoricians have fallen, and especially Her­ <lb/>
            magoras, a man otherwise of great sagacity, and deserving of <lb/>
            admi ration on many accounts, and censurable only for too <lb/>
            anxious diligence, so that even what we blame in him is not <lb/>
            unworthy of some degree of commendation. 23. But the way <lb/>
            which I follow is far shorter, and for that reason plainer, and <lb/>
            will neither fatigue the learner with long windings, nor ener <lb/>
            vate the body of his language by portioning it out into minute <lb/>
            particulars.† For he who sees what point it is that comes <note type="footnote"> * C. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> t A mixture of metaphors unusual with Quintilian. </note> <pb n="249"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.XI.] </note> <lb/>
            into controversy; what the opposite side wishes to do with <lb/>
            regard to it, and by what means; what his own side has to <lb/>
            do, (a particular especially to be regarded,) cannot be without <lb/>
            a full understanding of all the matters on which I have just <lb/>
            spoken. 24. Nor can there, we may say, be any person, not <lb/>
            utterly devoid of sense, and a stranger to all practice in <lb/>
            pleading, that does not know what it is that gives rise to a <lb/>
            discussion, (which is called by the rhetoricians the cause and <lb/>
            the containing point,) what is the question between two <lb/>
            parties, and on what point judgment must be given ; which <lb/>
            three things are indeed all the same; for the subject of the <lb/>
            question is that which comes into controversy, and judgment <lb/>
            is given respecting that which is the subject of the question.</p>
          <p>25. But we do not perpetually keep our attention fixed on <lb/>
            these matters, but, moved with the desire of obtaining praise <lb/>
            by whatever means, or carried away with the pleasure of <lb/>
            speaking, we allow ourselves to wander from our subject; since <lb/>
            matter without the cause is always more abundant than within <lb/>
            it, for in the controversy itself there is indeed comparatively <lb/>
            little, and everything else is beyond its limits ; and, in the one <lb/>
            case, we speak only of matters in which we have been in­ <lb/>
            structed, in the other, on whatever we please. 26. Nor is it <lb/>
            so much to be charged upon ourselves that we should discover <lb/>
            the question, the containing point, and the point for judgment, <lb/>
            (for to discover them is easy,) as that we should always look <lb/>
            steadily to our object, or at least, if we digress from it, should <lb/>
            recover sight of it, lest, while we are striving for applause, our <lb/>
            arms should drop from our grasp.</p>
          <p>27. The school of Theodorus, as I said,. distinguishes <lb/>
            every thing into heads ; under which term several particulars <lb/>
            are comprehended. Under the first only the main question, <lb/>
            the same as the state; under the next, other questions, which <lb/>
            refer to the main question ; under the third, the proposition <lb/>
            with its proofs. The word is used in the same sense in which <lb/>
            we say caput rei est, “ it is the head of the business;" in <lb/>
            Menander,* <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰεϕάλαιόν ἐστι</foreign>. But, in general, whatever is to be <lb/>

          <p>The grandsons of the sister of Domitian committed to the tuition of <lb/>
            Quintilian ; a new motive for care in composing his work. He <lb/>
            proceeds to speak of the exordium of a speech, the statement of <lb/>
            facts, the proof, the refutation of adverse allegations, and the <lb/>
            peroration.</p>
          <p>1. AFTER finishing, my dear Marcellus Victor, the third <lb/>
            book of the work dedicated to you, and completing about the <lb/>
            fourth part of my task, a motive for fresh diligence, and deeper <lb/>
            solicitude as to the judgment that I may deserve from the <lb/>
            public, have occurred to me. Hitherto we were but compar­ <lb/>
            ing studies, as it were, between ourselves; and if my method <lb/>
            of instruction was but little approved by others, I thought my­ <lb/>
            self likely to be quite contented with our domestic advantage, <lb/>
            deeming it sufficient to regulate the education of your son and <lb/>
            my own. 2. But since Domitian Augustus has vouchsafed <lb/>
            me the charge of his sister's grandsons,* I should not suffi­ <lb/>
            ciently feel the honour of his divine judgment,! if I were not <lb/>
            to estimate the greatness of my undertaking as proportioned <lb/>
            to this distinction. 3. For what pains can I spare in the culti­ <lb/>
            vation of the morals of youth, in order that the most upright <lb/>
            of censors ‡ may have reason to approve them ? Or in pro­ <lb/>
            moting their studies, that I may not be found to have disap­ <lb/>
            pointed, in this respect, the expectations of a prince most <lb/>
            eminent, not only in other accomplishments, but also in elo­ <lb/>
            quence? 4. And if no one is surprised that the greatest <note type="footnote"> * They were the sons of Flavius Clemens and Domitilla, the grand- <lb/>

            unknown. See Suet. Dom. c. 15; Dion. Cass. p. 1112, ed. Reim. <lb/>

            poets have often invoked the Muses, not only at the beginning <lb/>
            of their works, but, on advancing in their course, and arriving <lb/>
            at some point of great importance, have renewed their addresses, <lb/>
            and used as it were fresh solicitations, 5. I myself shall surely <lb/>
            be pardoned also, if I now do that which I omitted to do when <lb/>
            I entered on my subject, and call all the deities to my aid, <lb/>
            and especially him than whom there is no deity more auspicious <lb/>
            or more peculiarly favourable to learning; in order that he may <lb/>
            inspire me with ability proportioned to the expectation which <lb/>
            he has raised of me, may propitiously and kindly support me, <lb/>
            and render me in reality such as he has supposed me to be.</p>
          <p>6. For such devotional feeling, this, though my greatest, is <lb/>
            not my only reason; for besides, as my work advances, the <lb/>
            parts on which I am entering are more important and <lb/>
            more difficult than those which have preceded them. It <lb/>
            is now to be shown, in the next place, what is the process <lb/>
            of judicial causes, which are extremely numerous and diver­ <lb/>
            sified; what is the purpose of the exordium; what is the <lb/>
            proper form of a statement of facts; what constitutes the force <lb/>
            of proofs, either when we confirm our own assertions, or over­ <lb/>
            throw those of our adversary; and what is the power of a pero­ <lb/>
            ration, either when the memory of the judge is to be refreshed <lb/>
            by a short recapitulation, or when, what is far the most effec­ <lb/>
            tive, his feelings are to be excited. 7. On these particulars, some <lb/>
            authors, as if they dreaded the weight of the whole in a body, <lb/>
            have preferred to write separately, and even thus have published <lb/>
            several books on each of them; while I, having ventured to <lb/>
            embrace them all, see before me a labour almost boundless, <lb/>
            and am oppressed with the very thought of the task which I <lb/>
            have undertaken. But, as I have begun, I must persevere; <lb/>
            and, if I fail in strength, must nevertheless proceed with <lb/>
            courage. <pb n="253"/>

          <p>1. THAT which is called the beginning, or exordium in Latin, <lb/>
            the Greeks seem with greater reason to have termed the <lb/>
            : for by our writers is signified only a commencement, <lb/>
            but the Greek rhetoricians plainly show that this is the part pre­ <lb/>
            liminary to the entrance on the subject on which the orator is <lb/>
            to speak. 2. For whether it be because <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴμη</foreign> signifies a tune, <lb/>
            and players on the lyre * have called the short prelude that <lb/>
            they execute, for the purpose of conciliating favour, before they <lb/>
            enter upon the regular contest for the prize,! a proærnium, <lb/>
            orators, in consequence, have distinguished the address which <lb/>
            they make to gain the good will of the judges, before they com­ <lb/>
            mence their pleading, by the same appellation; 3. or whether, <lb/>
            because the Greeks call a way <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴμος</foreign> it became a practice to call <lb/>
            that a proæmium which precedes the entrance on a subject; it <lb/>
            is certainly the proem, or exordium, that pioduces a good effect <lb/>
            on the judge before he understands what the cause is; and we <lb/>
            act erroneously in the schools, in using exordia of such a nature <note type="footnote"> * Aristot. Rhet. iii. 14, 1. </note><note type="footnote"> + Legitimum certamen.] Some read carmen, observes Rollin. Spald­ <lb/>
            ing says that he met with carmen in the text only of one manuscript, <lb/>
            but saw it in the margin of some others. " It is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν</foreign> that is <lb/>
            meant, in which they contended for the honour and reward of skill. <lb/>
            Examples are numerous; see, eg. Sueton. Ner. c. 12, 22, 23." Gesner </note> <pb n="254"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IV </note> <lb/>
            as if the judge was thoroughly acquainted with the cause. 4. <lb/>
            The liberty taken in this respect arises from the- circumstance <lb/>
            that the usual idea of the cause * is given previous to the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of the declamation. Such kind of exordia may <lb/>
            be adopted indeed in the forum in second processes, but <lb/>
            in a first process t seldom or ever, unless we chance to <lb/>
            plead before a judge to whom the matter has become known <lb/>
            from some other quarter.</p>
          <p>5 In giving an exordium at all there is no other object but <lb/>
            to prepare the hearer to listen to us more readily in the sub­ <lb/>
            sequent parts of our pleading. This object, as is agreed <lb/>
            among most authors, is principally effected by three means, <lb/>
            by securing his good will and attention, and by rendering him <lb/>
            desirous of further information; not that these ends are not <lb/>
            to be kept in view throughout the whole pleading, but because <lb/>
            they are pre-eminently necessary at the commencement, when <lb/>
            we gain admission as it were into the mind of the judge in <lb/>
            order to penetrate still farther into it.</p>
          <p>6. As to good will, we either gain it from persons connected <lb/>
            with the cause, or have it from the cause itself. But in respect <lb/>
            to persons, regard is not to had to three only, (as most rhe­ <lb/>
            toricians have supposed,) the prosecutor, the defendant, and the <lb/>
            judge ; for the exordium sometimes cakes its complexion from <lb/>
            the character of the pleader ; and though he speaks sparingly <lb/>
            and modestly concerning himself, yet, if he be deemed a good <lb/>
            man, much influence, in reference to the whole cause, may de­ <lb/>
            pend on that consideration; for he will then be thought to bring <lb/>
            to the support of his party not merely the zeal of an advocate, <lb/>
            but almost the testimony of a witness. 7. Let him be regarded <lb/>
            as coming to plead, therefore, from being induced by obligations <lb/>
            of kindred or friendship, or above all, if it be possible, by respect <lb/>
            for his country, or for some strong considerations of precedent. <lb/>
            This, without doubt, is still more to be observed by the parties <note type="footnote"> * Illa velut imago litis.] That is, the thema, which is prefixed to the <lb/>
            declamation, as in those of Seneca and Quintilian. See iv. 2, 28 ; vii- <lb/>

            days. Not that this secunda actio really took place ; but such is the <lb/>

            themselves, so that they may seem to go to law from some <lb/>
            important and honourable motive, or even from necessity.</p>
          <p>8. But as the authority of the speaker becomes thus of the <lb/>
            highest efficacy, if, in his undertaking the business, all suspi­ <lb/>
            cion of meanness, or hatred, or ambition, be far removed from <lb/>
            him, so it is a sort of tacit commendation to him, if he represents <lb/>
            himself as weak, and inferior in ability to those acting ageinst <lb/>
            him, a practice which is adopted in most of the exordia of <lb/>
            Messala. 9. For there is a natural feeling in behalf of those <lb/>
            oppressed ; and a conscientious judge most willingly listens to <lb/>
            an advocate whom he does not suspect of any design to draw <lb/>
            him from justice. Hence arose that dissembling of the speakers <lb/>
            of antiquity to conceal their eloquence, so extremely different <lb/>
            from the ostentation of our times.</p>
          <p>10. We must also take care not to appear insolent, malig­ <lb/>
            nant, overbearing ,or reproachful towards any man or body of <lb/>
            men, especially such as cannot be wounded without exciting <lb/>
            an unfavourable feeling in the judge. 11. That nothing <lb/>
            should be said against the judge himself, not only openly, but <lb/>
            nothing even that can be understood as adverse to him, it <lb/>
            would be foolish in me to advise, if such things did not some­ <lb/>
            times take place.</p>
          <p>The character of the advocate for the opposite party may <lb/>
            sometimes afford us matter for an exordium; if we speak of <lb/>
            him sometimes with honour, making it appear that we fear <lb/>
            his eloquence and influence, so as to render them objects of <lb/>
            suspicion to the judge; or sometimes, though very rarely, with <lb/>
            contempt, as Asinius Pollio, in pleading for the heirs of <lb/>
            Urbinia,* enumerates the choice of Labienus as advocate for <lb/>
            the opposite party among the proofs of the badness of their <lb/>
            cause. 12. Cornelius Celsus denies that such remarks consti­ <lb/>
            tute exordia, as having no relation to the cause; I, however, <lb/>
            am led to form a contrary opinion, not only by the authority <note type="footnote"> * To the enmity between Asinius Pollio and Labienus I have <lb/>
            alluded on i. 5, 8. The Urbinian case, as far as it can be understood <lb/>
            from two other passages in which it is noticed, (vii. 2, 5, 26,) was of the <lb/>
            following nature : Certain persons, who, resting their claims either on <lb/>
            -a will or on relationship, sought to get possession of the property of <lb/>
            Urbinia, were opposed by Clusinius Figulus, whom the claimants <lb/>
            declared to be a slave, his real name being Sosipater ; and whose <lb/>
            character Pollio tried to depreciate by remarking on his connexion <lb/>
            with a man so unprincipled as Labienus. Comp. xiL 1, 13. Spalding, </note> <pb n="256"/>
             <note type="margin">[a IV. </note> <lb/>
            of the greatest authors, but because I consider, for my own <lb/>
            part, that whatever relates to the pleader of the cause relates <lb/>
            to the cause itself; since it is but natural that judges should <lb/>
            be more inclined to believe those whom they are more inclined <lb/>
            to hear.</p>
          <p>13. As to the character of the prosecutor, it may be treated <lb/>
            in various ways ; sometimes his worth may be asserted, some­ <lb/>
            times his weakness commended to notice. Sometimes a state­ <lb/>
            ment of his merits may be proper, when a pleader may speak <lb/>
            with less reserve in praise of another's worth than he would in <lb/>
            that of his own. Sex, age, condition, are of great influence, <lb/>
            as in the case of women, old men, or wards, when they plead <lb/>
            in the character of wives, parents, or children. 14. Commi <lb/>
            seration alone, indeed, has effect even upon a right-minded <lb/>
            judge. But such matters are to be lightly touched, and not <lb/>
            exhausted, in an exordium.</p>
          <p>The character of the adversary is commonly attacked with <lb/>
            references to topics of a similar nature, but directed against <lb/>
            him; for on the powerful envy must be shown to attend, on <lb/>
            the mean and abject, contempt; on the base and criminal, <lb/>
            hatred; three qualities that have great power in alienating the <lb/>
            favour of the judges. 15. Nor is it enough merely to state <lb/>
            such particulars, (for this is in the power even of the ignorant,) <lb/>
            but most of them must be magnified or extenuated, as may <lb/>
            be expedient; for to give effect to them is the business of the <lb/>
            orator.; the mere expression of them may be inherent in the <lb/>
            cause itself.</p>
          <p>16. The favour of the judge wp shall conciliate, not merely <lb/>
            by offering him praise, (which ought indeed to be given with <lb/>
            moderation, though it is to be remembered at the same time, <lb/>
            that the privilege of offering it is common to both parties,) but <lb/>
            by turning his praises to the advantage of our cause, appealing, <lb/>
            in behalf of the noble to his dignified station, in behalf of the <lb/>
            humble to his justice, in behalf of the unfortunate to his pity, <lb/>
            in behalf of the injured to his severity; and using similar <lb/>
            appeals in other cases. 17. I should wish also, if possible, tc <lb/>
            know the character of the judge, for, according as it may be <lb/>
            violent, gentle, obliging, grave, austere, or easy, it will be <lb/>
            proper to make his feelings subservient to our cause where they <lb/>
            fall in with it, and to soften them where they are repugnant to it.</p>
          <p>18. But it sometimes happens, also, that he who sits as <pb n="257"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.I.] </note> <lb/>
            judge is either our enemy or the friend of our opponent, a <lb/>
            circumstance which ought to claim the attention of both sides, <lb/>
            but more particularly, perhaps, of that to which the judge <lb/>
            seems to incline. For there is sometimes, in unprincipled <lb/>
            judges.- a foolish propensity to give sentence against their <lb/>
            friends, or in favour of parties with whom they are at enmity, <lb/>
            and to act unjustly that they may not seem to be unjust.</p>
          <p>19. Some have been judges, too, in their own causes. I <lb/>
            find, for instance, in the books of observations published by <lb/>
            Septimius,t that Cicero was engaged in a cause of that nature; <lb/>
            and I myself pleaded the cause of Queen Berenice before <lb/>
            that queen herself. In this case the mode of procedure is <lb/>
            similar to that in those which I have just mentioned; for he <lb/>
            who pleads in opposition to the judge exaggerates the confi­ <lb/>

            established. Fear¶ is sometimes to be removed from the <lb/>
            mind of the judge; as Cicero, in his speech for Milo, strove to <lb/>
            convince the judges that they were not to think the arms of <lb/>
            Pompey arrayed against them ; and sometimes to be held out to <note type="footnote"> * Pravis judicibus hie ambitus.] Aldus reads pravus. </note><note type="footnote"> t To this Septimius and his work no other writer appears to make <lb/>

            them, as Cicero acted in his pleadings against Verres. 21. But <lb/>
            of the two modes of producing fear in the judges, the one is <lb/>
            common and well received, when we express concern, for ex­ <lb/>
            ample, that the Roman people may not think unfavourably oj <lb/>
            them; or that their privilege of sitting as judges may not be <lb/>
            transferred from them to another body ;+ but the other is unusual <lb/>
            and violent, when the speaker threatens the judges with a <lb/>
            charge of bribery; a threat which it is certainly safer to address <lb/>
            to a larger body of judges than to a small one, for the bad are <lb/>
            alarmed and the good pleased, but to a single judge I should <lb/>
            never recommend it to be used, unless every other resource <lb/>
            has failed. 22. But should necessity drive us to it, it is <lb/>
            no part of oratorical art, any more than to appeal from the <lb/>
            judgment of the tribunal, (though an appeal is often advanta­ <lb/>
            geous,) or to impeach a judge before he gives sentence; for <lb/>
            one who is not an orator may threaten and denounce.</p>
          <p>23. If the nature of the cause itself afford us topics for con­ <lb/>
            ciliating the judge, it will be proper, above all, that such of <lb/>
            them be selected for introduction into the exordium as may <lb/>
            appear most favourable to our object. On this head Virginius ‡ <lb/>
            is in error, for he says Theodorus is of opinion that from every <lb/>
            question in the cause some thought may be selected for the <lb/>
            exordium. 24. Theodorus does not say this, but merely that <lb/>
            the judge is to be prepared for the most important points; a <lb/>
            precept in which there would be nothing objectionable, if it <lb/>
            did not enjoin that as a general rule which every pleading <lb/>
            does not admit, and which every cause does not require. For <lb/>
            when we rise to open the case on behalf of the prosecutor, <lb/>
            while it is still unknown to the judge, how shall we bring <lb/>
            forward thoughts from every question in it ? Surely the sub­ <lb/>
            ject must previously be stated. Let us admit that some ques­ <lb/>
            tions may then be brought forward, (for so the form of our <lb/>
            pleading sometimes requires,) but must we, therefore, bring <lb/>
            forward all the most important ones, that is, the whole cause ? <lb/>
            If so, the statement of facts will be dispatched in the exordium. <note type="footnote"> * The first actio against Verres, which is wholly in place of an <lb/>

            25. Or if, as frequently happens, the cause is somewhat diffi­ <lb/>
            cult, should we not try to gain the goodwill of the judge in <lb/>
            other parts of the pleadings, and not present the bare roughness <lb/>
            of every point to his mind before we have attempted to incline <lb/>
            it in our favour? If such matters were always rightly <lb/>
            managed at the opening of a speech, there would be no need <lb/>
            of any formal exordium. 26. At times, accordingly, some par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, which may be of great effect in conciliating the favour <lb/>
            of the judge, may be previously. introduced, and not without <lb/>
            advantage, in the commencement.</p>
          <p>What points, again, are likely to gain us favour in causes, <lb/>
            it is not necessary for me to enumerate; for they will be mani­ <lb/>
            test to the pleader, when he understands the nature of a cause ; <lb/>
            and all particulars, in so great a variety of suits, cannot possi­ <lb/>
            bly be specified. 27. But as it is for the service of a cause to <lb/>
            discover and amplify its favourable points, so it is expedient to <lb/>
            refute, or at least to extenuate, whatever is prejudicial to it. <lb/>
            Compassion may also spring from the nature of our cause, if <lb/>
            we have suffered, or are likely to suffer, any severe misfortune.</p>
          <p>28. Nor am I inclined, as some are, to think that an <lb/>
            exordium differs from a peroration only in this respect, that <lb/>
            in a peroration is narrated what has gone before, and in an <lb/>
            exordium is set forth what is to come. The difference rather <lb/>
            lies in this, that in the introduction the kind feelings of the <lb/>
            judge should be touched, but cautiously and modestly; while <lb/>
            in the peroration we may give full scope to the pathetic, we may <lb/>
            attribute fictitious speeches to our characters, and evoke the <lb/>
            dead and produce their children it attempts which are not made <lb/>
            in exordia.</p>
          <p>29. But as to those feelings of pity, which I mentioned above,‡ <lb/>
            it is necessary not only to excite them in our favour in the <lb/>
            exordium, but to turn away the effect of them from our oppo­ <lb/>
            nent ; and as it is for our advantage that our lot should be <lb/>
            thought likely to be deplorable if we should be defeated, so is <lb/>
            it that the pride of our adversary should be apprehended as <lb/>
            likely to be overbearing if he should conquer. <note type="footnote"> * Interim.] " In the mean time," i.e., before proceeding to the body <lb/>

          <p>30. But exordia are often taken from matters which are not <lb/>
            properly concerns of our clients or their causes, but which yet <lb/>
            in some way relate to both of them. With the persons of our <lb/>
            clients are connected not only their wives and children, to <lb/>
            whom I have previously alluded,* but their relatives and <lb/>
            friends, and sometimes countries and cities, and whatever else <lb/>
            may be injured by the failure of those whom we are defending. <lb/>
            31. To the cause, among external circumstances, may be <lb/>
            referred the occasion, from which is derived the exordium in <lb/>
            behalf of Cœlius; t the place, from which is taken that in behalf <lb/>
            of Deiotarus; ‡ the appearance of things, whence that in behalf <lb/>
            of Milo ;§ public opinion, whence that against Verres ;|| and in <lb/>
            short, that I may not specify everything, the report respecting <lb/>
            the trial, the expectation of the people; for, though none of <lb/>
            these things form part of the cause, they yet have a con­ <lb/>
            nexion with the cause. 32. Theophrastus adds that an <lb/>
            exordium may be derived from the form of the pleading, <lb/>
            as that of Demosthenes for Ctesiphon appears to be, wheu <lb/>
            he entreats to be allowed to speak as he himself may think <lb/>
            most proper, rather than according to the mode which the pro­ <lb/>
            secutor has laid down in his charge. ¶</p>
          <p>33. Confidence often suffers from being thought to partake <lb/>
            of presumption. But artifices which procure us favour, and <lb/>
            which, though common to almost all pleaders, are not to be <lb/>
            neglected, even if for no other reason than that they <lb/>
            may not be first employed against us, are to wish, to <lb/>
            express detestation, to enterat, to show anxiety; because if a <lb/>
            cause appears to be brought forward which is new, important, <lb/>
            atrocious, and of consequence in regard to precedent, it gene­ <lb/>
            rally renders the judge extremely attentive, and especially if <lb/>
            be is moved by concern for himself or his country; and his <lb/>
            feelings must then be excited by hope, fear, admonition, sup­ <note type="footnote"> * I consider the allusion to be to sect. 28, not, as Gleaner thinks, to <lb/>

          <p>34. It also has effect in securing the attention of the audi­ <lb/>
            ence, if they think that we shall not detain them long, or <lb/>
            enter upon matters foreign to the subject. Such attention in <lb/>
            itself makes the judge desirous of information, and especially <lb/>
            if we can state, briefly and clearly, the substance of the matter <lb/>
            of which he has to take cognizance; a method which Homer <lb/>
            and Virgil have adopted at the commencement of their poems. <lb/>
            35. As to the length of it, it should be such as to resemble a <lb/>
            proposition rather than an exposition, and show, not how every <lb/>
            particular in the cause occurred, but on what particulars the <lb/>
            pleader intends to speak. Nor do I know that a better <lb/>
            example of such a summary can be found than that of Cicero <lb/>
            in his speech for Aulus Cluentius: 36. "I have remarked, <lb/>
            judges, that the whole speech of the accuser is divided into <lb/>
            two parts ;f of which one appeared to me to rest, and princi­ <lb/>
            pally to depend, on the odium, now long prevalent, arising <lb/>
            from the judgment of Junius, the other to touch, for form's <lb/>
            sake, timidly and diffidently, on the question of the charge <lb/>
            of poisoning, though it is on this point that the present <lb/>
            inquiry has according to law been instituted." All this, how­ <lb/>
            ever, is more easy for the defender than the prosecutor; <lb/>
            because by the one the judge is merely to be warned, by the <lb/>
            other he must be informed.</p>
          <p>37. Nor shall any authors, however eminent, induce me to <lb/>
            entertain the opinion that I may sometimes dispense with <lb/>
            rendering the judge attentive and willing to listen. (Not that <lb/>
            I am ignorant of the reason which is alleged by them, namely, <lb/>
            that it is for the advantage of a bad cause that its nature <lb/>
            should not be understood; but the truth is, that the judge's <lb/>
            ignorance of a cause does not arise from inattention on his <note type="footnote"> * Vanitate.] That is mendacio, as Capperonier has rightly explained <lb/>
            it. Badius, Rollin, and Gedoyn, fixing their thoughts unhappily on <lb/>

            and I am surprised to see that Gesner is similarly inclined. Com­ <lb/>

            part, but from error into which he is led.) 38. Suppose that <lb/>
            our adversary has spoken, and has perhaps produced conviction <lb/>
            in the judge ; we require that his opinion should be changed, <lb/>
            and it cannot be altered unless we render him attentive and <lb/>
            willing to listen to what we are going to say. How are we to <lb/>
            act then ? I consider that some of our adversary's arguments <lb/>
            must be weakened, or depreciated, and noticed with a sort <lb/>
            of contempt, in order to lessen the strong feeling of favour <lb/>
            which the judge has for the opposite party; a method which <lb/>
            Cicero adopted in pleading for Ligarius. 39. For what else <lb/>
            was the object of that irony,. but that Cæsar might be induced <lb/>
            to give less attention to the cause, as presenting no extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary features ? What is the purpose of the speech for Cœlius, <lb/>
            but that the charge might seem less important than it was <lb/>
            thought to be ?</p>
          <p>But of the rules which I have proposed, it is evident that <lb/>
            some are applicable to one sort of causes, and some to another. <lb/>
            40. The kinds of causes,! too, most rhetoricians pronounce to <lb/>
            be five, the honourable, the mean, the doubtful or ambiguous, <lb/>
            the paradoxical, and the obscure ; that is, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνδοξον</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄδοξον</foreign>, <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίδοξον</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παάδοξον</foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυσπααϰολούθητον</foreign>. Some <lb/>
            think that to these it is proper to add the base, which some <lb/>
            comprehend under the mean, others under the paradoxical. <lb/>
            41. What they call paradoxical, is something that is brought <lb/>
            to pass contrary to human expectation. In an ambiguous <lb/>
            cause we should make it our chief object to render the judge <lb/>
            well affected, in an obscure one desirous of information, in a <lb/>
            mean one attentive. As for an honourable cause, it has sum. <lb/>
            dent attraction in itself to conciliate ; in one that is paradox­ <lb/>
            ical or base, there is need of palliation.</p>
          <p>42. Hence some divide the exordium into two parts, the <lb/>
            introduction and the insinuation; in order that in general, in <lb/>
            the introduction, there may be a straightforward request for <lb/>
            the judge's goodwill and attention; but, as this cannot be <lb/>
            made in a dishonourable cause, some insinuation may then be <lb/>
            directed cautiously into his mind, especially if the aspect of <note type="footnote"> * Comp. sect. 70. </note><note type="footnote"> t This has reference only to the judiciale genus causarum, of which <lb/>
            these five genera are in reality species ;they are mentioned by Cicero <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH.I] </note> <lb/>
            the cause is not even plausible, either because the ground of <lb/>
            it is dishonourable in itself, or because it is disapproved by the <lb/>
            public; or if, again, the cause suffers from the appearance of <lb/>
            a patron or a father against a client or a son,* which renders <lb/>
            it unpopular, or from that of an old or blind man, or an <lb/>
            infant, which excites feelings of compassion. 43. What arts <lb/>
            we must adopt to counteract these difficulties, rhetoricians <lb/>
            teach us at great length, imagining cases for themselves, and <lb/>
            treating them according to the forms of judicial processes; <lb/>
            but such peculiarities, as they spring from varieties of causes <lb/>
            of which we cannot give rules as to every species, unless they <lb/>
            be comprehended under general heads, might be enumerated <lb/>
            to infinity. 44. For every difficulty a remedy must therefore be <lb/>
            sought from the peculiar nature of the case. Let it, however, <lb/>
            be laid down as a general rule, that we should turn from that <lb/>
            which is prejudicial to us to that which is favourable. If we <lb/>
            are perplexed about our cause, the character of our client may <lb/>
            aid us; if about our client, the nature of our cause; if <lb/>
            nothing that can be a support to us, presents itself, we may <lb/>
            seek for something to damage our adversary; for as it is our <lb/>
            greatest wish to gain more favour than our adversary, so it <lb/>
            will be our next object to incur less dislike. 45. In regard <lb/>
            to offences which cannot be denied, we must endeavour to <lb/>
            make them appear less heavy than has been represented, or <lb/>
            to have been committed with another intent, or to have no <lb/>
            reference to the present question, or to be capable of being <lb/>
            expiated by repentance, or to have been already sufficiently <lb/>
            punished. Such allegations it is easier for the advocate to <lb/>
            make, therefore, than for his client; for he can praise without <lb/>
            incurring the charge of conceit, and may sometimes even blame <lb/>
            to advantage. 46. He will sometimes, accordingly, pretend <lb/>
            that he is moved with concern, (like Cicero in his speech for <lb/>
            Rabirius Posthumus,) in order to gain the ear of the judge, <lb/>
            and will assume the sincerity of a person who feels the truth of <lb/>
            what he says with a view to gain greater belief when he proceeds <lb/>
            to justify or disprove the charges against his client. We are, <lb/>
            therefore, to consider first of all whether we should adopt the <note type="footnote"> * If a client pleads against his patron, or a Ion against his father, <lb/>
            the very appearance and presence of either the patron or the father on <lb/>

            audience), discourages the client or the son. Rollin. </note> <pb n="264"/>

            character of a party in the suit or of an advocate, whenever <lb/>
            either is in our power. In the schools, indeed, there is free <lb/>
            choice; but in the forum, it is rare that a person is competent <lb/>
            tc plead his own cause. 47. A youth learning to declaim, <lb/>
            however, ought to plead causes, such at least as chiefly depend <lb/>
            on the pathetic, in the character of the parties themselves; <lb/>
            for the feelings cannot be transferred; and the emotion <lb/>
            received from another person's mind is not communicated with <lb/>
            the same force as that which proceeds from our own. 48. For <lb/>
            these reasons there is thought to be need of insinuation, if the <lb/>
            pleading of our opponent has taken effect on the mind of the <lb/>
            judges, or if we have to address them when their attention is <lb/>
            fatigued; from the one of which difficulties we shall extricate <lb/>
            ourselves by promising to bring our own proofs, and by eluding <lb/>
            the arguments of the adversary, and from the other by giving <lb/>
            hopes that we shall be brief, and by recurring to those other <lb/>
            means by which I have shown- that the judge may be rendered <lb/>
            attentive. 49. A little pleasantry, too, seasonably introduced, <lb/>
            refreshes the minds of the judges, and gratification, from <lb/>
            whatever quarter produced, relieves the tedium of listening; <lb/>
            Nor is the art of anticipating what is likely to be said against <lb/>
            us without its use; as Cicero sayst that he knew some had <lb/>
            expressed surprise that he, who had for so many years defended <lb/>
            many, but prosecuted none, should now appear as the accuser of <lb/>
            Verres; and then shows that the accusation of Verres is a de­ <lb/>
            fence of the allies. This rhetorical artifice is called prolepsis, or <lb/>
            " anticipation." 50. As it is useful at times, it is now almost <lb/>
            constantly adopted by some declaimers, who think that they <lb/>
            must never begin but with something contrary to their real <lb/>
            object.</p>
          <p>Those who follow Apollodorus deny that there are only the <lb/>
            three ways which I have specified ‡ of propitiating the judge, <lb/>
            and enumerate various other sorts of them, almost infinite in <lb/>
            number, derived from the character of the judge, from notions <lb/>
            formed of circumstances relating to the cause, § from opinions <lb/>
            entertained of the cause itself, and from the elements of which <lb/>
            every cause is composed, as persons, deeds, words, motives, <note type="footnote"> * Sect 83, 34. </note><note type="footnote"> + At the commencement of the Divinatio in Q.

             <lb/>
            seasons, places, occasions, and the like. 51. That advantage <lb/>
            may really be taken of these particulam, I readily admit, but <lb/>
            consider that they all come under the three heads specified; <lb/>
            for if I make the judge propitious, attentive, and ready to be <lb/>
            informed, I find nothing more that I need desire; as the very <lb/>
            fear,. which appears to have the greatest influence indepen­ <lb/>
            dent of these particulars, both secures the attention of the <lb/>
            judge, and deters him from showing partiality to the opposite <lb/>
            side.</p>
          <p>52. Since it is not sufficient, however, to indicate to learn­ <lb/>
            ers what enters into the nature of an exordium, without <lb/>
            instructing them also how an exordium may be best composed, <lb/>
            I add that he who is going to speak should reflect what he has <lb/>
            to say, before whom, for or against whom, at what time or place, <lb/>
            amidst what concurrence of circumstances, under what prepos­ <lb/>
            sessions of the public ; what opinion it is likely that the judge <lb/>
            has formed previous to the commencement of the pleadings, <lb/>
            and what the speaker has to desire or deprecate. Nature herself <lb/>
            will lead him to understand what he ought to say first. 63. <lb/>
            But now they think anything with which they happen to start, <lb/>
            an introduction, and whatever occurs to them, especially if it <lb/>
            be some thought that pleases them, serves them, forsooth, for <lb/>
            an exordium. Many points, doubtless, may be introduced into <lb/>
            the exordium which are derived from other parts of the cause, <lb/>
            or which are common to the exordium with other parts; but <lb/>
            nothing will be said preferably in any particular part, but that <lb/>
            which cannot be said equally well in any other part.</p>
          <p>54. There is much attraction in an exordium which derives <lb/>
            its substance from the pleading of our opponent, for this <lb/>
            reason, that it does not appear to have been composed at <lb/>
            home, but to be produced on the spot, and from the suggestion <lb/>
            of the subject; it increases the reputation of the speaker for <lb/>
            ability, from the facility which he exhibits, and, from wearing <lb/>
            the appearance of a plain address, prompted by what has just <lb/>
            been said, gains him the confidence of his audience; insomuch <lb/>
            that, though the rest of his speech may be written and care­ <lb/>
            fully studied, the whole of it nevertheless seems almost entirely <lb/>
            extemporaneous, as it is evident that its commencement re­ <lb/>
            ceived no preparation at all. 55. Very frequently, too, an <lb/>
            exordium will be pleasing from a certain modesty in th <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 20, seqq. Spalding. </note> <pb n="266"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            thoughts, style,. tone, and look of the speaker, so far that even <lb/>
            in a cause which hardly admits of controversy, the confidence <lb/>
            of the orator ought not to display itself too plainly; for the <lb/>
            judge generally detests assurance in a pleader, and, as he <lb/>
            knows his own authority, tacitly looks for a due portion of <lb/>
            respect. 56. We must take no less care, also, that we may <lb/>
            not excite suspicion in the exordium ; and therefore no appear­ <lb/>
            ance of study ought to be shown in it, because all art on the <lb/>
            part of the orator seems to be directed against the judge. <lb/>
            57. But to avoid the suspicion of using art is the achievement <lb/>
            of the highest art; a precept which is given by all writers on <lb/>
            rhetoric, and with the utmost propriety; yet the present <lb/>
            practice, from the state of things in our times, is somewhat at <lb/>
            variance with it; because on certain trials, especially capital <lb/>
            ones, and those before the centumviri,f the judges themselves <lb/>
            require to be addressed in careful and formal speeches, ‡ and <lb/>
            think themselves slighted if study is not apparent in every <lb/>
            pleading before them, desiring not only to be instructed but <lb/>
            to be pleased. 58. Moderation in such a practice is difficult, § <lb/>
            but it may be so far observed that we may give our oratory the <lb/>
            appearance of carefulness and not of cunning.</p>
          <p>Of the old precepts this still remains in force, that no <lb/>
            unusual expression, no highly audacious metaphor, nothing <lb/>
            borrowedfrom what is obsolete and antiquated, or from poetic <lb/>
            license, should appear in the exordium. 59. For we are not <lb/>
            as yet admitted to full freedom of speech, and the attention of <lb/>
            the audience, being still fresh, keeps us under restraint, but <lb/>
            when their minds are propitiated and warmed, greater liberty <lb/>
            will be tolerated, and especially when we have entered on <lb/>
            those moral topics || of declamation whose natural fertility <lb/>
            prevents the boldness of an expression from being observed <lb/>
            amid the splendour of beauty that surrounds it. ¶</p>
          <p>60. Our style in the exordium ought not to resemble that <lb/>
            of the argumentative, or sentimental, or narrative parts of our <note type="footnote"> * Compositionis.] Sc. verborum. Capperonier. </note><note type="footnote"> + See iii. 10, 3. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡Comp. iv. 2, 122; v. 10, 115. </note><note type="footnote"> § Comp. iv. 1,9; xii 9, 5. </note><note type="footnote"> || Locos.] See. ii. 1, 11 ; 4, 22. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ See c. 2, sect. 117; and ix. 4, 29. </note> <pb n="267"/>

            speech. Nor should our manner be too prolix* or circum. <lb/>
            locutory, but should wear the appearance of simplicity and <lb/>
            unaffectedness, not promising too much either in words or <lb/>
            look. A mode of delivery in which all art is concealed, and <lb/>
            which, as the Greeks say, is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνεπίϕατος</foreign>, "unostentatious," <lb/>
            steals often most successfully on the mind of the hearer. But <lb/>
            such points are to be managed according to the way in which <lb/>
            it is expedient that the minds of the judges should be im­ <lb/>
            pressed.</p>
          <p>61. To be confused in memory, or to lose our fluency of <lb/>
            speech, has nowhere a worse effect than at the commencement, <lb/>
            as a faulty exordium may be compared to a countenance dis­ <lb/>
            figured with scars; and that pilot is surely one of the worst <lb/>
            who runs his vessel aground as it is leaving the harbour. As <lb/>
            to the length of an exordium, it must be regulated by the <lb/>
            nature of the cause. 62. Simple causes require but a short <lb/>
            introduction; such as are perplexed, suspicious, or unpopular, <lb/>
            demand a longer one. But those who have prescribed laws for <lb/>
            all exordia, saying that they must be limited to four sentences, † <lb/>
            make themselves ridiculous. Yet immoderate length in the <lb/>
            introduction is no less to be avoided, lest the speech should <lb/>
            seem to have a head of disproportionate size, and lest that <lb/>
            which ‡ought to prepare the hearer should weary him.</p>
          <p>63. The figure by which the orator's address is turned from <lb/>
            the judge, and which is called apostrophe, some rhetoricians <lb/>
            wholly exclude from the exordium, being doubtless led by <lb/>
            some show of reason to form such an opinion on this point; for <lb/>
            it must be admitted that it is most natural for us to address <lb/>
            ourselves chiefly to those whose good will we desire to secure. <lb/>
            64. At times, however, some striking thought § may be neces­ <note type="footnote"> * Oratio—deducta.] Stating matters in a long series, as deducere <lb/>

            rules, should we be prevented from giving force to our con­ <lb/>
            ceptions by this figure? 65. Writers of books on the art, <lb/>
            indeed, do not proscribe the figure as being illicit, but because <lb/>
            they do not think it advantageous; and thus, should the <lb/>
            advantage of using it be proved, we shall be forced to adopt it <lb/>
            for the same reason for which we are now prevented. 66. De­ <lb/>
            mosthenes †directs his remarks to Æschines in his exordium; <lb/>
            Cicero, in commencing his speech for Ligarius, addresses him- ^ <lb/>
            self to Tubero, and, in the beginning of those for several other <lb/>
            persons, speaks to whomsoever he pleases. 67. His exordium <lb/>
            to the speech for Ligarius, indeed, would have been much <lb/>
            more languid, if it had been in any other form; as the reader <lb/>
            will better understand, if he directs to the judge all that most <lb/>
            spirited part which is in this form, You have, therefore, Tubero, <lb/>
            that which is most to be desired by an accuser, etc., for then <lb/>
            the address would seem really turned away, ‡ and the whole <lb/>
            force of it would be lost if we were to say, Tubero therefore has <lb/>
            that which is most to be desired by an accuser. 68. In the <lb/>
            first method the orator urges and presses on his opponent; in <lb/>
            the second he would merely make a statement. The case <lb/>
            would be similar with the passage in Demosthenes, if you alter <lb/>
            the turn of it. Has not Sallust, too, adopted an exordium <lb/>
            directly addressed to Cicero, against whom he was pleading, <lb/>
            starting with the words, I should bear your reproaches, Marcus <lb/>
            Tullius, with concern and indignation, etc. ?§ The same <lb/>
            form has been chosen by Cicero in his attack on Catiline, How <lb/>

            troduces examples in the exordium; while in his speech for <lb/>
            Cluentius he commences, as I have previously observed,; with <lb/>
            partition.</p>
          <p>70. But these figures are not, because they may sometimes <lb/>
            be used effectively, to be used perpetually, but only whenever <lb/>
            reason prevails over rule; as we may sometimes employ the <lb/>
            simile, provided it be short, the metaphor, and other figures, <lb/>
            (which the timid and careful teachers of rhetoric prohibit,) <lb/>
            unless that noble specimen of irony in the speech for Ligarius, <lb/>
            which I noticed a little above,|| gives offence to any reader. <lb/>
            71. Other faults in exordia they have exposed with greater <lb/>
            justice. That sort of exordium which may be adapted to <lb/>
            several causes is called vulgar;¶ (a species which, though <lb/>
            regarded with little favour, we may occasionally adopt with <lb/>
            advantage, and which is not always avoided by the greatest <lb/>
            orators;) that which our opponent may use as well as ourselves, <lb/>
            is termed common ; that which our opponent may turn to his <lb/>
            own purpose, is designated as commutable; that which has no <lb/>
            just connexion with the cause, is styled detached ; that which <lb/>
            is derived from some other subject, transplanted; some, again, <lb/>
            are blamed as long, or contrary to rule. Most of these faults, <lb/>
            however, are not peculiar to the exordium, but may be found <lb/>
            in any or every part of a speech.</p>
          <p>72. Such are the points to be noticed with respect to the <lb/>
            exordium, as often as there may be occasion for one ; which is <lb/>
            not always the case, for it is sometimes superfluous ; as when <lb/>
            the judge, for instance, is sufficiently prepared without it, or <note type="footnote"> * See x. 7, 30. The other trial of Scaurus was for extortion. <lb/>
            Cicero's defence of him on that occasion was published. Scaurus was <lb/>

            when the subject itself requires no introduction. Aristotle,* <lb/>
            indeed, denies that it is ever necessary in addressing able judges. <lb/>
            Sometimes, too, we cannot employ an exordium, even if we <lb/>
            wish ; as when the judge is much occupied, when time is short, <lb/>
            or when a superior authority t obliges us to enter at once upon <lb/>
            our subject. 73. Sometimes, on the other hand, the nature <lb/>
            of an exordium is found in other parts of the speech for in <lb/>
            the statement of facts, or in the course of our arguments, we <lb/>
            occasionally ask the judges to attend, or to be favourable to <lb/>
            us; a practice by which Prodicus thought that they might be <lb/>
            roused when disposed to sleep. 74. The following passage is <lb/>
            an example: Then Caius Varenus,§ he who was killed by the <lb/>
            slaves of Ancharius, (to this point, judges, pay, I beseech you, the <lb/>
            most careful attention,) etc. If the cause, moreover, consists of <lb/>
            many heads,|| a proper introduction must be prefixed to each <lb/>
            head : as, Listen now to what follows ; or, I now proceed to the <lb/>
            next particular. 75. But even among the proofs themselves <lb/>
            many observations occur that serve the purpose of an intro­ <lb/>
            duction, such as Cicero makes in his speech for Cluentius,¶ <lb/>
            when about to speak against the censors, and in that for Mu­ <lb/>
            nena,** when he makes an apology to Servius. But this prac­ <lb/>
            tice is so common as to make it unnecessary to establish it by <lb/>
            examples.</p>
          <p>76. Whether, when we have used an exordium, we after­ <lb/>
            wards commence a statement of facts, or proceed at once to <lb/>
            produce our proofs, that point ought to be stated last in our <lb/>
            introduction, with which the commencement of the sequel will <lb/>
            most naturally unite itself. 77. But the affectation in the <lb/>

            and trying to gain applause, forsooth, for what is little more <lb/>
            than a trick,* is frigid and puerile; though Ovid constantly <lb/>
            indulges in it in his Metamorphoses: but, for him, necessity <lb/>
            may be some excuse, as be had to unite things the most dis­ <lb/>
            cordant into the semblance of a whole. 78. But what need is <lb/>
            there for the orator to conceal his transitions, and impose upon <lb/>
            the judges, when they require to be admonished to give their <lb/>
            attention to the order of particulars ? The commencement of <lb/>
            the statement of facts will even be lost upon them, if they are <lb/>
            not aware that such statement is begun. 79. Accordingly, as it <lb/>
            is best not to rush abruptly into our statement, so it is preferable <lb/>
            not to pass to it without notice. But if a long and perplexed <lb/>
            exposition is to follow, the judges must be specially prepared <lb/>
            for it; as Cicero has done in many places, and more remarkably <lb/>
            in this :† I shall make a rather longer introduction than ordi­ <lb/>
            nary to demonstrate this point, and I entreat you, judges, not to <lb/>
            receive it unfavourably ; for, when the commencement is under­ <lb/>
            stood, you will with far more ease comprehend the sequel.</p>
          <p>Such are the principal notions which I have conceived <lb/>

          <p>Of the statement of facts ; some make too nice distinctions respecting <lb/>
            it, 1—3. A formal statement not always necessary, 4—8. Those <lb/>
            are mistaken who suppose that a statement is never necessary on <lb/>
            the part of an accused person who denies the charge, 9—19. <lb/>
            What the judge already knows may sometimes be stated, 20—23. <lb/>
            The statement need not always immediately follow the exordium, <lb/>
            24—27. The practice of the schools injudiciously transferred to <lb/>
            the forum, 28—30. The statements should be clear, brief, and <lb/>
            credible, 31—35. Of clearness, 36—39. Of brevity, 40—47. Of <lb/>
            credibility, 48—53. The statement of facts should prepare the <lb/>
            judge for the proof of them, 54—60. Certain qualities have in­ <lb/>
            judiciously been made peculiar to the statement 61—65. A <lb/>
            ridiculous direction that the statement should be omitted in a <lb/>
            cause which is unfavourable to us, 66. Difficult points must be <lb/>
            variously managed, according to the nature of the case, 67—74. <lb/>
            In a conjectural cause we must make a statement, but with art <lb/>
            and care, 75—81. We must sometimes divide our statement, and <lb/>
            invert the order of occurrences, 82—87. Of fictitious statements, <lb/>
            88—93. Complexion of a statement, 94—100. How we must <lb/>
            act if the facts be partly for us and partly against us, 101, 102. <lb/>
            Apostrophe and other figures absurdly excluded from the state­ <lb/>
            ment, 103—115. The statement should be embellished with <lb/>
            every grace of language, 116—124. Of authority in the pleader, <lb/>
            125—127. Of repetition, 128. Of the commencement and con­ <lb/>
            clusion of the statement, 129—132.</p>
          <p>1. IT is most natural, and ought to be most usual, that when <lb/>
            the judge has been prepared by the methods which have been <lb/>
            noticed above, the matter, on which he is to give judgment, <lb/>
            should be stated to him. 2. This is the narrative, or state­ <lb/>
            ment of the case; but, in touching upon it, I shall purposely <lb/>
            pass over the too subtle distinctions of those who make several <lb/>
            kinds of statements; for they will have an exposition, not only <lb/>
            of the business on which the question is brought before the <lb/>
            judges, but of the person whom it concerns, as, Marcus Pali­ <lb/>
            canus, a man of humble birth, a native of Picenum, loquacious <lb/>
            rather than eloquent;. or of the place at which it occurred, as, <lb/>
            Lampsacus, judges, is a town on the Hellespont ;f or of the <lb/>
            time, as, <note type="footnote"> * We learn from Aulus Gellius, i. 15, that these words are taken <lb/>

            give, when they show whence arose a war, a sedition, or a pesti­ <lb/>
            lence. 3. In addition to these distinctions, they call some <lb/>
            statements perfect, others imperfect; but who is not aware of <lb/>
            such a difference ? They add that there is a kind of statement <lb/>
            regarding past time, which is the most common kind; another <lb/>
            respecting the present, such as that of Cicero t about the stir <lb/>
            of Chrysogonus's friends when his name was mentioned; and <lb/>
            a third relating to the future, which can be allowed only to <lb/>
            prophets; for hypotyposis ‡ is not to be regarded as a state­ <lb/>
            ment of facts. 4. But let us turn our attention to matters of <lb/>
            more importance.</p>
          <p>Some have thought that there must always be a statement <lb/>
            of facts ;§ but that this notion is unfounded, may be proved by <lb/>
            many arguments. In the first place, there are some causes so <lb/>
            brief, that they require only a mere proposition || rather than <lb/>
            a statement. 5. This may happen at times on either side, <lb/>
            when there is either no exposition of matters, or when the <lb/>
            parties are agreed about the fact, and there is no dispute but <lb/>
            concerning the law; as in such questions as these before the <lb/>
            centumviri, Whether a son or a brother ought to be the <lb/>
            heir of a woman that dies intestate; or whether puberty <lb/>
            is to be decided by years or by a certain habit of body. Or <lb/>
            when there is indeed room for a statement of facts in the <lb/>
            cause, but every particular of it is previously known to the <lb/>
            judge, or has been fully set forth in the preceding part. 6. At <lb/>
            times, again, it may happen only on one side, and more fre­ <lb/>
            quently on that of the prosecutor, either because it is sufficient <lb/>
            for him to make a simple proposition, or because it is more <lb/>
            advantageous for him to do so. It may be sufficient, for <lb/>
            instance, to say, I claim a certain sum of money lent on <lb/>
            certain conditions; or, I claim a legacy according to a <note type="footnote"> * Virg. Georg. i. 48. </note><note type="footnote"> t Pro Rosc.

            certain will: and it will be for the opposite party to show <lb/>
            why such claims are not due. 7. It is sufficient for the <lb/>
            prosecutor, and more advantageous, to open his cause in <lb/>
            this way, I say that the sister of Horatius has been killed <lb/>
            by him, for the judge comprehends the whole charge from <lb/>
            this one proposition ; and then the way in which the act <lb/>
            took place, and the motive for it, are left rather to be <lb/>
            stated by the defendant. 8. As for the accused person, he <lb/>
            will withhold a statement of facts, when the charge against <lb/>
            him can neither be denied nor palliated, but will rest solely on <lb/>
            a question of law; thus, in the case of the man who, having <lb/>
            stolen the money of a private person out of a temple, is <lb/>
            accused of sacrilege, a confession will show more modesty <lb/>
            than a statement. We do not deny, the defendant and his advo­ <lb/>
            cate may say, that the money was taken from the temple; but <lb/>
            the accuser makes the charge that we are amenable to the larD <lb/>
            against sacrilege, though the money was private, and not conse­ <lb/>
            crated; and it is for you to decide the question whether <lb/>
            sacrilege has been committed.</p>
          <p>9. But though I allow that there are at times such reasons <lb/>
            for giving no statement of facts, I dissent from those who <lb/>
            think that there is no statement when an accused person <lb/>
            merely denies the charge which is brought against him; an <lb/>
            opinion which is held by Cornelius Celsus, who considers that <lb/>
            most trials for murder, and all those for bribery and extortion, <lb/>
            are of this class; 10. for he thinks that there are no state­ <lb/>
            ments of facts but such as give a general exposition of the <lb/>
            charge on which judgment is to be pronounced ; yet he admits <lb/>
            himself that Cicero gives a statement of facts in his oration <lb/>
            for Rabirius Posthumus; though Cicero denies that any money <lb/>
            came into the hands of Rabirius, which was the very point on <lb/>
            which the question rested; and, in his statement of facts, he <lb/>
            gives no exposition of the charge.</p>
          <p>11. For my part, besides resting on the authority of emi­ <lb/>
            nent rhetoricians, I am myself of opinion that there are two <lb/>
            kinds of statements in judicial causes; the one sort being an <lb/>
            exposition of the cause itself, and the other of the circum <lb/>
            stances connected with it. 12. I have not killed a man <lb/>
            here there is no statement of facts; it is admitted that there <lb/>
            is none; but there will be one, and sometimes a long one, in <lb/>
            reply to the support of the accusation, and in regard to the <pb n="275"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.II.] </note> <lb/>
            past life of the accused, the causes by which an innocent man <lb/>
            has been brought into peril, and other circumstances by which <lb/>
            the charge is rendered incredible. 13. For the accuser does <lb/>
            not say merely, You have killed, but states by what proofs he <lb/>
            can establish his assertion; as in tragedies, when Teucer <lb/>
            accuses Ulysses of having killed Ajax,* saying that he was <lb/>
            found in a solitary place, near the dead body of his enemy, <lb/>
            and with a blood-stained sword in his hand, Ulysses does <lb/>
            not merely reply that the deed was not committed by him, <lb/>
            but affirms that there was no enmity between Ajax and him­ <lb/>
            self, and that they had been rivals only for glory; and then <lb/>
            adds how he came into that lonely spot, saw the dead body <lb/>
            lying on the ground, and drew the sword out of the wound. <lb/>
            To this statement are subjoined various arguments.! 14. But <lb/>
            there is a statement of fact even when the accuser says, You <lb/>
            were in the place in which your enemy was killed, and the <lb/>
            defendant says, I was not, for he must show where he was. <lb/>
            For the same reason, causes of bribery and extortion may <lb/>
            have several statements of this kind, as there may be several <lb/>
            heads of accusation; in which statements, indeed, the charges <lb/>
            will be denied, but resistance must at the same time be made <lb/>
            to the accuser's arguments, sometimes singly, sometimes in a <lb/>
            body, by an exposition of matters totally different from his. <lb/>
            15. Will a person accused of bribery act wrong in stating <lb/>
            what sort of parents he had, how he himself has lived, or on <lb/>
            what pretensions he relied when he proceeded to stand for <lb/>
            office? Or if a man is accused of extortion, may he not <lb/>
            advantageously give an account of his past life, and of the <lb/>
            means by which he brought upon him the resentment of his <lb/>
            whole province, or of his accuser, or some particular witness ? <lb/>
            16. If such an account is not a statement of facts, neither is <lb/>
            that first speech of Cicero in behalf of Cluentius, commencing <lb/>
            with the words Aulus Cluentius Habitus;‡ for there is nothing <lb/>
            in that speech about the poisoning, but merely about the <note type="footnote"> * We find nothing of this sort in the tragedies now extant relating <lb/>
            to this subject. That of Sophocles represents Ulysses as friendly to <lb/>

            causes by which his mother became his enemy. 17. State­ <lb/>
            ments also relate to the cause, but are not part of the cause <lb/>
            itself, which are given for the sake of example, as that in <lb/>
            Cicero's speech against Verres concerning Lucius Domitius,* <lb/>
            who crucified a shepherd because he confessed that he had <lb/>
            used a hunting-spear in killing a boar which he offered as a <lb/>
            present to Domitius; 18. or for the purpose of exposing some <lb/>
            charge foreign to the case, as in Cicero's oration for Rabirius <lb/>
            Postbumus :t For as soon as he came to Alexandria, judges, <lb/>
            the only method of preserving his money proposed by the king <lb/>
            to Posthumus was this, that he should take the charge, and <lb/>
            as it were stewardship, of the palace; or with the inten­ <lb/>
            tion of exaggerating, as in the description of the journey of <lb/>
            V erres.‡</p>
          <p>19. Sometimes a fictitious statement of particulars is intro­ <lb/>
            duced ; either to rouse the feelings of the judges, as that in <lb/>
            the speech for Roscius respecting Chrysogonus, which I men. <lb/>
            tioned a little above; § or to amuse them with a little plea­ <lb/>
            santry, as that in the speech for Cluentius regarding the <lb/>
            brothers Cepasii; || or, occasionally, to make a digression for <lb/>
            the purpose of embellishment, as that in the speech against <lb/>
            Verres IT concerning Proserpine: It was in these parts that a <lb/>
            mother is said formerly to have sought her daughter. All these <lb/>
            observations assist to show that he who denies may not only <lb/>
            make a statement, but a statement concerning the very point <lb/>
            which he denies.</p>
          <p>20. Nor is the observation which I made above, that a <lb/>
            statement is superfluous respecting a matter with which the <lb/>
            judge is acquainted, to be taken absolutely; for I wish it to be <lb/>
            understood in this sense, that it is superfluous if the judge not <lb/>
            only knows the fact, but takes such a view of it as is favoura­ <lb/>
            ble to our side. 21. For a statement of facts is not made <lb/>
            merely that the judge may comprehend the case, but rather <lb/>
            that he may look upon it in the same light with ourselves. <note type="footnote"> * In Verr. v. 3. Burmann thinks that obtuderat in the text should <lb/>

            tion of some new member taking his seat among the judges; <lb/>
            sometimes, in order that even the by-standers may be convinced <lb/>
            of the iniquity of what is asserted on the opposite side. In <lb/>
            this case, the statement must be diversified with varieties of <lb/>
            phraseology, to spare the judge the weariness of hearing what <lb/>
            he already knows; thus, we may say, You remember, and, Per­ <lb/>
            haps it may be unnecessary to dwell on this point, or, But why <lb/>
            should I say more on this subject, when you are already <lb/>
            acquainted with it? or, Of the nature of this affair, you are <lb/>
            not ignorant; or we may introduce various other phrases similar <lb/>
            to these. 23. Besides, if a statement of facts seem always <lb/>
            unnecessary before a judge to whom the cause is known, the <lb/>
            pleading of the cause before him may seem also to be some­ <lb/>
            times unnecessary.</p>
          <p>24. There is another point about which there is still more <lb/>
            frequently a question, Whether the statement of facts is always <lb/>
            to be immediately subjoined to the exordium; and those who <lb/>
            hold the affirmative cannot be thought destitute of arguments <lb/>
            to support them; for as the exordium is made with the intent <lb/>
            that the judge may be rendered more favourable by it, and <lb/>
            more willing and attentive to understand the case, and as proof <lb/>
            cannot be adduced unless the case be previously understood, it <lb/>
            appears right that the judge should at once be made master of <lb/>
            the facts. 2 5. B ut the nature of a cause sometimes j ustly changes <lb/>
            this order; unless, perchance, Cicero be thought, in that excel­ <lb/>
            lent oration which he wrote on behalf of Milo, and which he <lb/>
            has left to us, to have injudiciously delayed his statement of <lb/>
            facts, by introducing three questions - before it; or unless it <lb/>
            would have been of any profit to relate how Clodius lay in <lb/>
            wait for Milo, if it had been supposed impossible for an accused <lb/>
            person, who confessed that he had killed a man, to be defended, <note type="footnote"> * These three questions are to be gathered from what follows: <lb/>
            l. About defending a man who confessed that he had killed another. <lb/>
            2. About the pre-judgment of the senate. 3. About the feeling of <lb/>
            Pompey. Spalding. </note> <pb n="278"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV </note> <lb/>
            or if Milo had been already prejudged and condemned by the <lb/>
            senate, or if Pompey, who, to favour some party, had sur­ <lb/>
            rounded the place of trial with a troop of armed men, had <lb/>
            been dreaded by Milo as ill-disposed towards him. 26. These <lb/>
            questions, therefore, were of the nature of an exordium, as <lb/>
            they all served to prepare the judge. But in his speech for <lb/>
            Varenus, also, he did not introduce his statement of facts <lb/>
            until he had refuted certain allegations. This mode of pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding will be of advantage, too, whenever the charge is not <lb/>
            only to be resisted, but to be retorted on the opposite party, <lb/>
            so that our own case being first established, our statement of <lb/>
            facts may be the commencement as it were of a charge against <lb/>
            our adversary; as, in a passage of arms, care to ward off a blow <lb/>
            takes the precedence of anxiety to inflict one</p>
          <p>27. There are some causes, and indeed not a few, which <lb/>
            are easy to be defended so far as to refute the charge on which <lb/>
            the trial bears, but which labour under many grievous enormi­ <lb/>
            ties of the defendant's former life; and these must first be set <lb/>
            aside, in order that the judge may listen favourably to the <lb/>
            defence of the point about which the question really is. Thus, <lb/>
            when Marcus Coelius is to be defended, does not his advocate <lb/>
            judiciously repel the imputations against him of luxury, licen­ <lb/>
            tiousness, and immorality, before he proceeds to consider that <lb/>
            of poisoning ? It is about these points that the whole of <lb/>
            Cicero's pleading is employed. And does he not then make a <lb/>
            statement about the property of Palla,* and explain the whole <lb/>
            question respecting the violence,† which is defended by the <lb/>
            pleading of Cælius himself?‡ 28. But the custom of the <lb/>
            schools is our guide, in which certain points are proposed for <lb/>
            us to speak upon, which we call themata,§ and beyond which <lb/>
            there is nothing to be refuted ; and thus it is that our state­ <lb/>
            ment of facts is always subjoined to our exordium. 29. Hence, <lb/>
            too, is the liberty which the declaimers take to make a state­ <lb/>
            ment of facts even when they appear to speak in the second <note type="footnote"> * Cic. pro Cæl c. 10. We know nothing of that affair from any <lb/>

            place in a cause; * for when they speak for the prosecutor,! <lb/>
            they make a statement of facts just as if they were speaking <lb/>
            first, and a defence as if they were replying to the opposite <lb/>
            party; and such practice is very proper; for as declamation is <lb/>
            an exercise preparatory to pleading in the forum, why should <lb/>
            not learners qualify themselves to take either the first or second <lb/>
            place ? But, ignorant of the proceedings in the courts, they <lb/>
            think that when they come into the forum no departure is to <lb/>
            be made from the manner to which they have been accustomed <lb/>
            in the schools. 30. Yet even in scholastic declamations it <lb/>
            occasionally happens that a mere proposition‡ is in place of a <lb/>
            statement of the case; for what statement has he to make <lb/>
            who accuses a jealous man of ill-treating his wife, or he who <lb/>
            accuses a cynic § of indecency before the censors, when the <lb/>
            whole charge is sufficiently expressed by a single word, in <lb/>
            whatever part of the speech it be introduced ? But on this <lb/>
            head I have said enough.</p>
          <p>31. 1 shall now add some remarks on the method of stating <lb/>
            a case. A statement of a case is an account of a thing done, or <lb/>
            supposed to have been done; which account is adapted to per­ <lb/>
            suade ; or, as Apollodorus defines it, a narrative to inform the <lb/>
            auditor what the matter in question is. Most writers, and <lb/>
            especially those who are of the school of Isocrates, direct that <lb/>
            it should be lucid, brief, and probable. It is of no con­ <lb/>
            sequence if, instead of lucid, we say perspicuous, or, instead <lb/>
            of probable, credible or apparently deserving of belief. <lb/>
            32. Of this specification I approve ; though Aristotle || differs <lb/>
            from Isocrates in one particular, as he ridicules the direction <note type="footnote"> * Ut etiam secundo partis suæ loco narrare videantur.] Dicendi locus, <lb/>
            which learned men have laboured to explain, is nothing else but the <lb/>
            order in speaking which was assigned to each advocate; for it was not <lb/>
            invariably settled in the forum that the accuser should speak first, and <lb/>
            the defendant reply ; see vii. 1, 37. He therefore spoke in the second <lb/>
            place to whom the duty was committed of answering the statements <lb/>
            on the opposite side, whether he was the prosecutor or the accused. <lb/>
            In the schools, where there was no replying, there was no such order <lb/>
            observed; v. 13, 50; vii. l, 88. Hence we understand why Quintilian <lb/>

            about brevity, as if it were absolutely necessary that a state­ <lb/>
            ment should be long or short, and as if there were no possi­ <lb/>
            bility of fixing on a just medium. As to the followers of <lb/>
            Theodorus, they recognize only the last quality, saying that it <lb/>
            is not always proper to state briefly or lucidly. 33. On this <lb/>
            account I must the more carefully distinguish the various <lb/>
            peculiarities of statements, in order to show on what occasions <lb/>
            each quality is most desirable.</p>
          <p>A statement, then, is either wholly in our oun favour, <lb/>
            wholly in that of OUT opponent, or a mixture of both. If it be <lb/>
            wholly in our own favour, we may be content with the three <lb/>
            qualities of which the effect is that the judge more readily <lb/>
            understands, remembers, and believes. 34. Nor let any one <lb/>
            think me to blame for remarking that the statement which is <lb/>
            wholly in our favour ought to be made probable, though it be true; <lb/>
            for there are many narratives true which are not probable, and <lb/>
            many probable which are not true. We must therefore take ne <lb/>
            less pains that the judge may believe what we say truly than <lb/>
            what we invent. 35. The qualities, indeed, which I have just <lb/>
            enumerated, are meritorious in other parts of our speech ; for <lb/>
            through our whole pleading we should avoid obscurity; a certain <lb/>
            succinctness in what we say should be everywhere observed; <lb/>
            and all that is advanced ought to be credible. But these <lb/>
            qualities are most of all to be studied in that part which gives <lb/>
            the first information to the judge; for if, in that part, he <lb/>
            happens not to understand, not to remember, or not to, <lb/>
            relieve, we shall exert ourselves to no purpose in the sequel.</p>
          <p>36. The statement, however, will be clear and perspicuous, <lb/>
            if it be expressed, first of all, in proper and significant words, <lb/>
            not mean, nor far-sought, nor at variance with common use, <lb/>
            and if it give a lucid account, also, as to circumstances, <lb/>
            persons, occasions, places, and motives, and be delivered, at <lb/>
            the same time, in such a way that the judge may without <lb/>
            difficulty comprehend what is said. 37. This excellence is . <lb/>
            wholly disregarded by most speakers, who, prepared for the <lb/>
            shouts of a multitude, whether suborned for the purpose or <lb/>
            collected by chance, cannot endure the silence of an attentive <lb/>
            auditory, arid do not think themselves eloquent unless they <lb/>
            shake the whole court with noise and vociferation; they con <lb/>
            sider that to stated-matter calmly belongs only to every-day <lb/>
            conversation, and is in the power of even the most illiterate. <pb n="281"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH It ] </note> <lb/>
            while, in truth, it is uncertain whether they will not or cannot <lb/>
            perform that of which they express such easy contempt. <lb/>
            38. For if they try every department of eloquence, they will <lb/>
            find nothing more difficult than to say what every one, when <lb/>
            he has heard it, thinks that he himself would have said ; and <lb/>
            for this reason, that he does not contemplate it as said with <lb/>
            ability, but with truth ; but it is when an orator is thought to <lb/>
            speak truth that he speaks best. 39. But now, as if they had <lb/>
            found a wide field for themselves in their statement, they <lb/>
            assume an extravagant tone of voice in this part of their <lb/>
            speech, throw back their heads,. strike their elbow against <lb/>
            their sides, and revel in every sort of combination of thoughts <lb/>
            and words; while, what is monstrous, their delivery pleases, <lb/>
            and their cause is not understood. But let me put an end to <lb/>
            these animadversions, lest I should gain less favour by pre­ <lb/>
            scribing what is right than ill-will by censuring what is wrong.</p>
          <p>40. Our statement will be sufficiently concise, if, in the <lb/>
            first place, we commence the exposition of the case at the <lb/>
            point where it begins to concern the judge; next, if we say <lb/>
            nothing foreign to the cause; and, lastly, if we retrench every­ <lb/>
            thing of which the absence will deduct nothing from the <lb/>
            knowledge of the judge or the advantage of our client. 41. <lb/>
            For there is often a brevity in parts, which nevertheless leaves <lb/>
            the whole very long; as, I came to the harbour; I beheld a <lb/>
            vessel; I asked for how much it would take me; I agreed <lb/>
            about the price; I went on board; the anchor was weighed; <lb/>
            we loosed our cable,† and set sail. Here none of the <lb/>
            phrases can be expressed with greater brevity; yet it would <lb/>
            be sufficient to say, I set sail from the harbour ; and whenever <lb/>
            the event sufficiently indicates what has preceded it, we ought <lb/>
            to be content with expressing that from which the rest is <lb/>
            understood. 42. As I can easily say, therefore, I have a <lb/>
            grown-up son, it is quite superfluous for me to indulge in <lb/>
            circumlocution, and say, Being desirous of having children, I <lb/>
            married a wife, I had a son born to me, I reared him, and <lb/>
            have brought him up to full age. Some of the Greek <lb/>
            writers, accordingly, have distinguished a concise exposition, <note type="footnote"> * Cervicem reponunt.] As a sign of self-satisfaction. So Cic. in <lb/>

            superfluous, while the other may possibly want something that <lb/>
            is necessary. 43. For myself, I make brevity consist, not in <lb/>
            saying less, but in not saying more, than is necessary; for as <lb/>
            to repetitions, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυτολογίαι</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεϱισσολογίαι</foreign>, which some <lb/>
            writers on rhetoric desire to be avoided in a statement of facts, <lb/>
            I say nothing about them, since such faults are to be shunned <lb/>
            for other reasons than that of observing brevity.</p>
          <p>44. We must no less be on our guard, however, against <lb/>
            that obscurity which attends on those who abbreviate every <lb/>
            part too much; and it is better that there should be something <lb/>
            superabundant in a statement than that anything should be <lb/>
            wanting; for what is unnecessary is attended with weariness, <lb/>
            but what is necessary is not withheld without danger. 45. We <lb/>
            must consequently avoid the conciseness of Sallust, (though <lb/>
            in him it is accounted a merit,) and all abruptness in our <lb/>
            language; that which does not escape a reader who has leisure <lb/>
            to re-examine, is perhaps lost altogether upon a mere auditor, <lb/>
            who has no opportunity of hearing it repeated; and a reader, <lb/>
            besides, is generally a person of learning; while a judge is <lb/>
            often one whom the country sends to the courts- to give a <lb/>
            decision on what he can manage to understand; so that <lb/>
            perhaps everywhere, but especially in the statement of facts, <lb/>
            we ought to adhere to a judicious medium in our language, <lb/>
            and say just what is necessary, and what is enough. <lb/>
            46. But by what is necessary I would not wish to be under­ <lb/>
            stood what is barely necessary to state a fact; for brevity ought <lb/>
            not to be wholly unadorned, or it becomes mere rudeness. What <lb/>
            attracts us, beguiles our attention; the more agreeable a story <lb/>
            is, the less long it appears; and a pleasant and easy road, <lb/>
            though it be of greater extent, fatigues us less than a shorter <lb/>
            one that is rugged and unattractive. 47. Nor would I ever <lb/>
            have so much regard to brevity as not to wish that everything <lb/>
            should be inserted that can make the statement of facts <note type="footnote"> * In decurias.] Decuriæ of the judices, of which Augustus constituted <lb/>

            grounds, and came into the city only when required to act as judices, <lb/>
            were for the most part rude and illiterate. These decuriæ were for <lb/>

            credible; for one that is every way plain and curtailed may be <lb/>
            called not so much a statement as a confession. There are also <lb/>
            many statements that are necessarily long from the nature of <lb/>
            the case, and for attending to them, as I recommended above,* <lb/>
            the judge must be prepared by the conclusion of the exordium ; <lb/>
            and we must then study, by every art in our power, to take <lb/>
            something from the length and something from the tediousness <lb/>
            of our narrative. 48. We shall make it somewhat less long, <lb/>
            if we defer such particulars as we can to another part of our <lb/>
            speech, not without specifying, however, what we defer: What <lb/>
            motives he had for killing him, whom he took as accomplices, <lb/>
            how he disposed his ambush, I shall relate when I offer my <lb/>
            proofs. 49. Some particulars, too, may be set aside, as it were, <lb/>
            out of the course of the narrative; an expedient of which we <lb/>
            have an example in Cicero: Fulcinius died; for many cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances that attended the event, I shall omit, as being <lb/>
            unconnected with the cause. Division also lessens the <lb/>
            tediousness of a statement: I shall relate what took place <lb/>
            before the commencement of the affair ; † I shall relate what <lb/>
            occurred during the course of it; I shall relate what happened <lb/>
            afterwards. 50. Thus there will appear rather to be three <lb/>
            short narratives than a single long one. Sometimes it will <lb/>
            be proper to break our statements by a short interlocution: <lb/>
            Ypu have heard what occurred before; hear now what <lb/>
            followed. Thus the judge will be relieved at the conclusion <lb/>
            of the first part, and will prepare himself for entering as it <lb/>
            were upon a new subject. 51. But if, when all these artifices <lb/>
            have been tried, the detail of particulars will still extend to <lb/>
            a great length, a kind of recapitulation at the end of each part <lb/>
            will not be without its advantage, such as Cicero ‡ gives even <lb/>
            in a short statement: Hitherto, Cæsar, Quintus Ligarius is <lb/>
            free from all blame ; he left his home not only for no war, but <lb/>
            without there being even the least suspicion of wart etc.</p>
          <p>52. As to credibility in our statement, it will not be wanting; <lb/>
            if we first consult our own judgment, so as to advance nothing <lb/>
            contrary to nature; and if, in addition, we assign causes and <lb/>
            motives for the facts which we detail; (I do not mean for all, <note type="footnote"> * C. 1. sect. 79. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ante ipsum rei contractem.] Every affair is said contrahi, when it it <lb/>
            entered upon, and hence contractus is used for initium. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Pro Ligar. c. 2. </note> <pb n="284"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.IV. </note> <lb/>
             <lb/>
            but for those about which there is any question;) and if <lb/>
            we represent our persons, at the same time, as of a character <lb/>
            in accordance with the facts which we wish to be believed of <lb/>
            them; a person accused of theft, for instance, as covetous ; of <lb/>
            adultery, as libidinous ; of homicide, as rash ; or the contrary, if <lb/>
            we are on the defence; and we must do the same with regard <lb/>
            to places, occasions, and similar particulars. 53. There is also <lb/>
            a certain management of the narrative which gives it credi­ <lb/>
            bility, as in plays and pantomimes; for some things naturally <lb/>
            follow and attach themselves to others, so that, if you make <lb/>
            the first part of your statement judiciously, the judge himself <lb/>
            will understand what you are going to say afterwards. 54. Nor <lb/>
            will it be without advantage if we scatter here and there some <lb/>
            seeds of proof, but so as not to forget that we are stating a <lb/>
            series of facts and not of arguments. Occasionally, however, <lb/>
            we may even confirm what we advance with some degree of <lb/>
            proof, but simple and short; for example, in a case of poison­ <lb/>
            ing, we may say, He was well when he drank, he fell down <lb/>
            suddenly, and a blackness and swelling of the body immediately <lb/>
            followed. 55. Preparatory remarks produce the same effect, <lb/>
            as when it is said that the accused was strong, armed, and on <lb/>
            his guard, in opposition to those who were weak, unarmed, and <lb/>
            unsuspecting. On everything, indeed, of which we have to <lb/>
            treat under the head of proof, as character, cause, place, time, <lb/>
            instrument, occasion, we may touch in our statement of facts. <lb/>
            56. Sometimes, if these considerations fail us, we may even <lb/>
            confess that the charge, though true, is scarcely credible, but <lb/>
            observe that it must be regarded on this account as a greater <lb/>
            atrocity; that we know not how it was committed, or why; <lb/>
            that we wonder at the occurrence, but will nevertheless prove <lb/>
            the truth of it. 57. But the best of all preparations of this <lb/>
            kind are those of which the intention is not apparent; as in <lb/>
            Cicero every circumstance is most happily premised by which <lb/>
            Clodius nay be proved to have lain in wait for Milo, and not <lb/>
            Milo for Clodius; but what has the greatest effect is that <lb/>
            most artful assumption of an air of simplicity: Milo having <lb/>
            been in the senate-house that day, returned home as soon as the <lb/>
            senate broke up, changed his shoes and his dress, and waited a <lb/>
            short time, while his wife, as is usual, was getting ready. <lb/>
            58. How well is Milo represented, as having done nothing <lb/>
            with premeditation, nothing with haste! This effect that <pb n="285"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            master of eloquence produces not only by the circumstances <lb/>
            which he narrates, and by which he signifies Mho's delay and <lb/>
            composed manner of departure, but by the familiar and ordi­ <lb/>
            nary words which he uses, and his well concealed art in <lb/>
            adopting them; for if the particulars had been stated in <lb/>
            other terms, they would have warned the judge, by their very <lb/>
            Bound,. to be on his guard against the pleader. 59. To most <lb/>
            people this passage appears lifeless, but it is hence manifest <lb/>
            how wholly the art escaped the judge, when it is hardly <lb/>
            observed even by a reader.</p>
          <p>Such are the qualities that render a statement of facts credi­ <lb/>
            ble. 60. As to directions that we should avoid contradictions <lb/>
            or inconsistencies, if any one needs them, he will receive <lb/>
            further instruction in vain, though some writers on rhetoric <lb/>
            introduce such matters into their works, imagining that they <lb/>
            were hidden from the world till they were sagaciously dis­ <lb/>
            covered by themselves</p>
          <p>61. To these three properties of a statement of facts some <lb/>
            add magnificence, which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγαλοπϱεπεία</foreign>, but which is <lb/>
            neither appropriate to all pleadings, (for what place can <lb/>
            language, raised above the ordinary level, have in most <lb/>
            causes about private property, about loans of money, <lb/>
            letting and hiring, and interdicts nor is always bene­ <lb/>
            ficial, as is evident from the last example from the speech for <lb/>
            Milo.</p>
          <p>62. Let us bear in mind, too, that there are many causes <lb/>
            in which we have to confess, to excuse, to extenuate what we <lb/>
            state, in all which cases magnificence of language is utterly <lb/>
            inadmissible. It is therefore no more our business, in making <lb/>
            a statement, to speak magnificently, than to speak dolefully, or <lb/>
            invidiously, or gravely, or agreeably, or politely; qualities which, <lb/>
            though each is commendable in its proper place, are not to be <lb/>
            assigned, and as it were devoted, to this part peculiarly.</p>
          <p>63. That quality, also, which Theodectes assigns peculiarly <lb/>
            to the narrative of facts, desiring that it should be not only <lb/>
            magnificent but pleasing, is, though very suitable to that part <lb/>
            of a speech, merely common to it with other parts. There are <lb/>
            some, too, who add clearness, or what the Greeks call <unclear>ἐϰϱγεία</unclear> <note type="footnote"> *I read strepituipso (not ipsum) judicem, a conjecture of Rollin <lb/>
            approved by Spalding. </note> <pb n="286"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV </note> <lb/>
            64. Nor will I deceive my reader so far as to conceal from him <lb/>
            that Cicero * desires several qualities in a statement of facts ; <lb/>
            for besides requiring it to be plain, and concise, and credible, <lb/>
            he would have it self-evident, characteristic, and suitable to the <lb/>
            occasion. But everything in a speech ought to be in some <lb/>
            degree characteristic and suitable to the occasion, as far as is <lb/>
            possible. Self-evidence in a narrative, as far as I understand the <lb/>
            meaning of the term, is doubtless a great merit, (as what is <lb/>
            true is not only to be told, but ought to a certain extent to <lb/>
            make itself seen,) but it may surely be included under perspi­ <lb/>
            cuity, which some, however, have even thought hurtful at times, <lb/>
            because in some cases, they say, truth must be disguised. <lb/>
            65. But this is an absurd observation ; for he who wishes to <lb/>
            disguise truth, wishes to relate what is false as if it were true <lb/>
            and, in what he relates, he must still study that his statement <lb/>
            may seem self-evident.</p>
          <p>66. But since we have come, by some chance as it were, to <lb/>
            a more difficult kind of statements, let me say something on <lb/>
            those causes in which the truth is against us; in which case <lb/>
            some have thought that the statement of facts should be wholly <lb/>
            omitted t Nothing, certainly, is easier than such omission, <lb/>
            except it be to forbear from pleading the cause altogether. But <lb/>
            if, for some good reason, you undertake a cause of this sort, what <lb/>
            art will there be in confessing by your silence that your cause is <lb/>
            bad ? unless you think that the judge will be so senseless as to <lb/>
            decide in favour of that which he knows that you are unwilling <lb/>
            to tell him. 67. I do not dispute that as some things in a <lb/>
            statement may be denied, others added, and others altered, so <lb/>
            likewise some may be suppressed ; but such only are to be <lb/>
            suppressed as we ought or are at liberty to suppress. This is <lb/>
            done sometimes for the sake of brevity, as when we say, for <lb/>
            example, He answered what he thought proper.</p>
          <p>68. Let us distinguish, therefore, the different kinds of <lb/>
            causes ; for in causes in which there is no question about the <lb/>
            charge, but only about a legal point, we may, though the <lb/>
            matter be against us, admit the truth: He took money from a <lb/>
            temple, but it was that of a private individual; and he has <lb/>
            therefore not committed sacrilege. He carried off a maiden; <lb/>
             <note type="footnote"> * De Orat. iL 80; Topic. a. 26; Part. Orat. a. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> t See v. 13, 16. </note> <pb n="287"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            yet option * is not to be granted to her father. 69. He dis­ <lb/>
            honoured a well-born youth ; and the youth, on being dis­ <lb/>
            honoured, hung himself, yet the author of his dishonour is not to <lb/>
            be capitally punished as being the cause of his death, but is to <lb/>
            pay ten thousand sesterces,† the fine imposed on him who is <lb/>
            guilty of such a crime. But in such confessions something of <lb/>
            the bad impression may be removed which the statement of <lb/>
            our opponent may have produced; since even our slaves <lb/>
            speak apologetically concerning their own faults. 70. Some <lb/>
            things, also, we may palliate without assuming the tone of <lb/>
            narrative: He did not, as our opponent alleges, enter the temple <lb/>
            for the purpose of stealing, or watch for a favourable moment <lb/>
            for accomplishing such object; but, tempted by the opportunity, <lb/>
            the absence of the guards, and the sight of money, which has <lb/>
            too strong‡ an influence over human resolution, he yielded. But <lb/>
            what has this to do with the question ? He transgressed, and <lb/>
            became a thief ? It is of no use to palliate an act of which we <lb/>
            do not shrink from the penalty. 71. Sometimes, too, we may <lb/>
            seem even to condemn our own client; addressing him, for ex­ <lb/>
            ample, thus: Would you have me say that you were excited with <lb/>
            wine ? That you fell into an error ? That you were led astray <lb/>
            in the darkness? All this may perhaps be true ; but you have <lb/>
            nevertheless dishonoured a free-born person ; you must pay ten <lb/>
            thousand sesterces. Sometimes, again, our cause may be <lb/>
            guarded by a careful opening, and then fully stated. 72. <lb/>
            Every thing was adverse to the three sons who conspired to <lb/>
            kill their father ; they had drawn lots, and had entered their <lb/>
            father's chamber, at night, one after another, while he was <lb/>
            sleeping; but, as none of them had the heart to kill him, <lb/>
            they confessed the whole matter to him when he awoke. <note type="footnote"> * The woman on whom a rape was committed had the privilege of <lb/>

            73. Yet if the father (who indeed divided his estate among <lb/>
            them, * and defended them when accused of parricide) should <lb/>
            plead thus, As to defence against the law, a charge ofparricide <lb/>
            is brought against young men whose father is still alive, and <lb/>
            appears on their behalf; and to give a regular statement of thecase, <lb/>
            therefore, would be superfluous, since the law has no bearing on it; <lb/>
            but if you require a confession of my own misconduct, I was an <lb/>
            austere father, and a tenacious guardian of that property which <lb/>
            would have been better managed by them; 74. and should then ob­ <lb/>
            serve that they were prompted to the act by youths whose fathers <lb/>
            were more indulgent, but had nevertheless such feelings as was <lb/>
            proved by the fact that they could not kill their father; for <lb/>
            that it would have been needless for them to take an oath to kill <lb/>
            him, if they had had the resolution to do so without it, nor would <lb/>
            there have been any need of a lot, had not each of them been <lb/>
            desirous to be exempted from the act; all arguments of this <lb/>
            nature, such as they are, would find the minds of the audience <lb/>
            more favourably disposed to receive them, when softened by <lb/>
            the brief defence offered in the first proposition. 75. But <lb/>
            when it is inquired whether a thing occurred, or what sort of <lb/>
            thing occurred, how, though everything be against us, can we <lb/>
            avoid making a statement, if we adhere to what is due to our <lb/>
            cause ? The accuser has made his statement, and, not con­ <lb/>
            fining himself to intimate how matters took place, has added <lb/>
            much to our prejudice, and exaggerated it by his language; his <lb/>
            proofs have been brought; his peroration has excited the judges, <lb/>
            and left them full of indignation ; they naturally wait to hear <lb/>
            what will be advanced on our side. 76. If we advance nothing, <lb/>
            the judges must necessarily believe that what our opponent <lb/>
            has said really happened, and that it happened just as he re­ <lb/>
            presented it. What then, it may be asked, shall we tell the <lb/>
            same story as our opponent ? If the question is about quality, <lb/>
            (which is the next consideration after that of fact is settled,) <lb/>
            we must tell the same story certainly, but not in the same <note type="footnote"> * This father had previously divided his estate among his sons who <lb/>

            he adds, is by no means clear; the word subjicitur is probably corrupt. </note> <pb n="289"/>

            way; we must assign other causes foi Actions, and give another <lb/>
            view of them. 77. We may extenuate some things by the <lb/>
            terms in which we speak of them; luxury may be mentioned <lb/>
            under the softer term of gaiety, <unclear>avarice</unclear> under that of frugality, <lb/>
            and carelessness under that of good nature. A certain degree <lb/>
            of favour, or at least of commiseration, we may gain by our look, <lb/>
            tone, or attitude. A confession of itself will sometimes draw tears.</p>
          <p>As to those who are of a contrary opinion about a statement, <lb/>
            I would willingly ask them whether they mean to justify, or <lb/>
            not to justify, that which they do not mean to narrate ? 78. For <lb/>
            if they neither justify facts, nor make a statement of them, <lb/>
            their whole cause will be betrayed; but if they mean to offer a <lb/>
            justification, it is surely necessary for them, for the most part, <lb/>
            to state what they intend to justify. Why, then, should we not <lb/>
            make a statement of that which may be refuted, and make it, <lb/>
            indeed, with that very object? 79. Or what difference is <lb/>
            there between proof and a statement of facts, except that a <lb/>
            statement is a connected exposition of that which is to be <lb/>
            proved, and proof is a verification of that which has been <lb/>
            stated ? Let us consider, then, whether such a statement, in <lb/>
            opposition to that of our opponent, ought not to be somewhat <lb/>
            longer and more verbose than ordinary, by reason that we <lb/>
            have to prepare the mind of the judge, and by reason of par­ <lb/>
            ticular arguments that we may introduce; (I say particular <lb/>
            arguments, and not a continued course of argumentation ;) and <lb/>
            it will give great effect to our statement if we affirm, from <lb/>
            time to time, that we shall establish what we say; that the <lb/>
            strength of our cause could not be shown in thefirst exposition of <lb/>
            it; that we intreat the judges to wait, suspend their opinions, <lb/>
            and trust that we shall make good our point. 80. Finally, we <lb/>
            must relate whatever can be related otherwise than our adver­ <lb/>
            sary has related it; or, for the same reason,* exordia in such <lb/>
            causes may be thought superfluous, since what further purpose <lb/>
            have they, than to render the judge more disposed to under <lb/>
            stand the cause? But it is admitted that there is nowhere <lb/>
            greater use for them, than where the mind of the judge is to <lb/>
            be freed from some prepossession conceived against us.</p>

            82. But, it may be said, some arguments are strong when <lb/>
            advanced in a body, but of less force when separated. This <lb/>
            remark, I answer, does not apply to the question Whether we <lb/>
            ought to make a statement, but how ice ought to make one. <lb/>
            For what hinders us from accumulating a variety of evidence <lb/>
            in our statement, and to promise to produce more? Or to <lb/>
            divide our statement into portions, to give proofs under each <lb/>
            portion as it is brought forward, and so proceed to what follows ? <lb/>
            83. For I do not agree with those who think that we must <lb/>
            always relate matters in the order in which they occurred : I <lb/>
            consider rather that we should relate them in the order which <lb/>
            is best for our cause. This may be effected by various arti­ <lb/>
            fices ; for sometimes we may pretend that something has <lb/>
            escaped our memory, with a view to introduce it into a place <lb/>
            better suited to our purpose; sometimes we may quit the <lb/>
            proper order, and assure the judge that we shall afterwards <lb/>
            return to it, as the case will thus be rendered clearer; some­ <lb/>
            times, after relating a fact, we may subjoin the motives that <lb/>
            preceded it; 84. for there is no fixed law for a defence, or any <lb/>
            invariable rule; we must consider what is best adapted to the <lb/>
            nature of the case, and to the occasion; and must act as in <lb/>
            regard to a wound, which, according to its state, must either <lb/>
            be dressed at once, or, if the dressing can be delayed, must be <lb/>
            bound up in the meanwhile. 85. Nor would I consider it <lb/>
            unlawful to repeat a thing several times, as Cicero has done in <lb/>
            his speech for Cluentius ; a liberty which is not only allowed to be <lb/>
            taken, but is sometimes even necessary, as in cases of extortion, <lb/>
            and all such as are not at all complicated.* It is the part of <lb/>
            a fool, indeed, to be led by a superstitious regard for rules to <note type="footnote">against him, he will hardly make a statement of it, unless he throws <lb/>
            the guilt upon some other party. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> * Comp. c. 1, sect. 74; c. 4, sect. 4. </note> <pb n="291"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            act against the interest of his cause.* 86. It is the practice to <lb/>
            put the statement of facts before the proofs, that the judge <lb/>
            may not be ignorant of the point about which the question is; <lb/>
            and why, then, if every circumstance is to be established or <lb/>
            refuted, is not every circumstance to be stated in our narrative ? <lb/>
            For myself, as far as any account is to be made of my practice, <lb/>
            I know that I used to adopt that method whenever the interest <lb/>
            of any cause required it, and with the approbation, too, of men <lb/>
            of experience, and of those who sat in judgment; and in <lb/>
            general, (a remark which I do not make from vanity, for there <lb/>
            are many, with whom I was associated in pleading, who can <lb/>
            contradict me if I speak falsely,) the duty of stating the case <lb/>
            was assigned to me. 87. Yet I would not on that account say <lb/>
            that we should not more frequently follow the order of facts. <lb/>
            In some facts the order cannot be changed without impropriety; <lb/>
            as if we should say, for example, that a woman had a child, and <lb/>
            should afterwards say that she conceived; that a will was <lb/>
            opened, and then that it was sealed; and if, in speaking of such <lb/>
            matters, you chance to mention first that which happened last, <lb/>
            it is best to make no allusion to that which happened first.</p>
          <p>88. There are also at times false statements ;† of which <lb/>
            two kinds are introduced in the forum; one, which depends on <lb/>
            extrinsic support; as Publius Clodius rested his cause on the <lb/>
            testimony of witnesses, when he affirmed that he was at <lb/>
            Interamna the night on which he committed a heinous crime <lb/>
            at Rome; the other, which must be supported by the ability of <lb/>
            the pleader; and this relies sometimes on a mere assumption <lb/>
            of modesty in him, whence it appears to me to be called com­ <lb/>
            plexion; sometimes on a peculiar representation of the case. <lb/>
            89. But, whichsoever of the two modes we adopt, our first care <lb/>
            must be that what we invent, be possible ; next that it be in <lb/>
            accordance with person, place, and time, and have a character <lb/>
            and order that are probable; and, if it be practicable, our <lb/>
            representation should be connected with something that is <lb/>
            acknowledged to be true; or be supported by some argument <lb/>
            relative to the question; for what is altogether sought from <lb/>
            without the cause, is apt to betray the licence which we take <lb/>
            in inventing. 90. We must be extremely watchful, too, that <lb/>
            no two particulars (as often happens with tellers of fiction) <note type="footnote"> * Comp. c. 1, sect. 64, 65 ; and a. 5, sect. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> + Camp. sect 19 </note> <note type="footnote"> U 2 </note> <pb n="292"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B,IV </note> <lb/>
            contradict one another; (for some things may suit very well <lb/>
            with certain parts* of our case, and yet not agree with each <lb/>
            other on the whole;) and also that they be not at variance <lb/>
            with what is acknowledged to be true ; it being a maxim even <lb/>
            in the schools, that the complexion is not to be sought from <lb/>
            without the argument. 91. But both in the schools and in <lb/>
            the forum, the speaker ought to keep in mind, throughout the <lb/>
            whole case, what he has invented, since what is not true is apt <lb/>
            to be forgotten, and the common saying is just, that a liar <lb/>
            ought to have a good memory. 92. Let us consider, also, that <lb/>
            if the question be concerning an act of our own, we must ad­ <lb/>
            here to one particular statement; but if concerning the act of <lb/>
            another, we may bring it under a variety of suspicious aspects. <lb/>
            In some scholastic causes, however, in which it is supposed <lb/>
            that a person under accusation does not answer to the questions <lb/>
            put to him,† liberty is granted to enumerate all the answers <lb/>
            that might have been given. 93. But let us remember that <lb/>
            we are to feign only such things as are not liable to be dis­ <lb/>
            proved by evidence; and these are such as proceed only from <lb/>
            our own thoughts, of which we alone are conscious; such as <lb/>
            are supposed to have been said by the dead, of whom none <lb/>
            will appear to refute them; or by one who has the same <lb/>
            interest with ourselves, for he will not contradict us; or even <lb/>
            by our adversary, as in denying them he will gain no credit. <lb/>
            94. As to imputed motives from dreams and superstitious feel­ <lb/>
            ings, they have lost all credibility from the ease with which <lb/>
            they are invented.</p>
          <p>Nor is it sufficient to adopt a certain colour in our statement <lb/>
            of facts, unless it preserve a consistency through the whole <lb/>
            case; especially as the only mode of establishing certain points <lb/>
            lies in asseveration and persistence; 95. as the parasite (who <lb/>
            claims as his son a youth that had been three times disin­ <lb/>
            herited t by a rich man, and allowed to return to him,) will <note type="footnote"> * Partibus blandiuntur.] Partibus is in the ablative case ; quibusdam <lb/>

            have some colour for asserting that poverty was his reason for <lb/>
            exposing the boy; that the character of parasite was assumed <lb/>
            by him merely because he had a son in that house, and that <lb/>
            the innocent youth was disinherited three times only because <lb/>
            he was not the son of the person who disinherited him. <lb/>
            96. But unless he exhibit, throughout all his speech, the <lb/>
            affection of a father, and that in the most ardent manner, <lb/>
            together with the hatred of the rich man towards the youth, <lb/>
            and his own fear for him, as knowing that he will stay with the <lb/>
            greatest danger in a house in which he is so detested, he will <lb/>
            not escape the suspicion of being a suborned claimant.</p>
          <p>97. It happens at times in the declamations of the schools, <lb/>
            (I know not whether it can possibly happen in the forum,) that <lb/>
            both parties make the same allegations, and each supports <lb/>
            them on its own behalf; as in this cause: 98. A wife informed <lb/>
            her husband that her step-son had endeavoured to seduce her, <lb/>
            and had appointed a time and placefor their meeting ; the son, on <lb/>
            his part, brought a similar charge against his step-mother, only <lb/>
            naming a different time and place; the father finds his son its <lb/>
            the place which the wife had named, and his wife in that <lb/>
            which the son had named; he divorced his wife, and, as <lb/>
            she said nothing, disinherited his son. Nothing can be <lb/>
            said on behalf of the young man, which may not also be <lb/>
            said on behalf of his step-mother. 99. What is common, <lb/>
            however, to both parties, will be stated; and then, from <lb/>
            the comparison of persons, from the order in which the infor­ <lb/>
            mations were given, and from the silence of the wife, when <lb/>
            divorced, arguments will be drawn. 100. Nor ought we to be <lb/>
            ignorant that there are some cases which do not admit of any <lb/>
            colouring, but are simply to be defended;t as was that of the <lb/>
            rich man, who lashed with a scourge the statue* of a poorer <note type="footnote">tention to disinherit his son, which the laws did not allow him to <lb/>
            carry into execution. Hence the son is said in the text to be absolutus. <lb/>
            or sent back to his father'a house. The rich man, thus repeatedly <lb/>
            disappointed, suborns a parasite whom he had in his house to claim <lb/>
            the young man as his own son, hoping to get rid of him by that means. <lb/>
            There were, in reality, no laws with regard to disinheriting; they were <lb/>
            merely fictions of the schools. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> * As when a person rests his defence solely on the law. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> f Badius Ascensius aptly illustrates this passage by citing a passage <lb/>
            from Paulus, Digest, xlv. 10, 27 : " If the statue of your father, <lb/>
            erected in his monument, has been injured by stones thrown at it </note> <pb n="294"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IT. </note> <lb/>
            man, that was his enemy, and was in consequence accused of <lb/>
            committing an insult. A pleader cannot say in palliation <lb/>
            of such an act that it was that of a sensible man; but he <lb/>
            may perhaps succeed in defending it from penalty.</p>
          <p>101. But if part of a statement be in our favour, and part <lb/>
            against us, we must deliberate, according to the nature of the <lb/>
            case, whether wo ought to blend those parts together, or keep <lb/>
            them distinct. If the facts which make against us be the <lb/>
            more numerous, those which are in our favour will be over­ <lb/>
            ,,-helmed by them. In such a case, then, it will be best tc <lb/>
            divide them, and, after stating and confirming the circum <lb/>
            stances that are favourable to us, to adopt against the rest such <lb/>
            remedies as we have already - specified. 102. If the facts in <lb/>
            our favour be the more numerous, we may very well unite <lb/>
            them, that those which are adverse to us, being placed as it <lb/>
            were in the midst of our auxiliaries, may have less force. <lb/>
            Neither the one nor the other, however, are to be exposed <lb/>
            undefended ; but we must take care to support such as favour <lb/>
            us with proof, and add reasons why such as are against us are <lb/>
            not to be credited ; because, unless we make a distinction, it <lb/>
            is to be feared that the good may be polluted by the contami­ <lb/>
            nation of the evil.</p>
          <p>103. The following directions, too, are commonly given <lb/>
            respecting the statement of facts; that no digression is to be <lb/>
            made from it; that we are to address ourselves constantly to the <lb/>
            judge that we are to speak in no character but our own ;and <lb/>
            that we are to introduce no argumentation; and some even <lb/>
            add that we are not to attempt to excite the feelings. These <lb/>
            precepts, doubtless, are to be in general observed; or, I may <lb/>
            say, never to be departed from, unless the nature of our cause <lb/>
            obliges us to disregard them. 104. In order that our state­ <lb/>
            ment may be clear and concise, nothing can be so seldom <lb/>
            justifiable in it as digression; nor ought there ever to be any <lb/>
            except such as is short, and of such a nature that we may seem <lb/>
            to be hurried into it, out of our right course, by the strength of <note type="footnote"> you cannot bring an action against the thrower of the stones for <lb/>
            violation of a sepulchre, but you may for the injury done to the <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH.II.] </note> <lb/>
            our feelings. 105. Such is that of Cicero respecting the mar­ <lb/>
            riage of Sassia: Oh, incredible wickedness in a woman! such as <lb/>
            has not been heard of,in the whole course of human life, except in <lb/>
            this one female! Oh, unbridled and immoderate lasciviousness! <lb/>
            Oh, unparalleled audacity! Not to have feared, if not the power of <lb/>
            the gods, or the opinion of men, at least that very night, and those <lb/>
            nuptial torches! Not to have respected the threshold of the cham­ <lb/>
            ber, or the couch of her daughter, or the very walls themselves, the <lb/>
            witnesses of her former, marriage! 106. As to constantly ad­ <lb/>
            dressing the judge, a brief diversion of our speech from him <lb/>
            sometimes intimates a thing more concisely, and gives it more <lb/>
            effect. On this point, accordingly, I hold the same opinion as <lb/>
            I expressed respecting the exordium ; and I think the same <lb/>
            with regard to the prosopopeia; which, however, not only <lb/>
            Servius Sulpicius † has used in his defence of Aufidia, “ That <lb/>
            you were languid with sleep, should I suppose, or oppressed with <lb/>
            a heavy lethargy ? " etc., but Cicero himself, in speaking of the <lb/>
            ship-masters, ‡ (for that passage is a statement of facts,) ex­ <lb/>
            claims, “For liberty to enter, you will give so much,” etc. <lb/>
            107. In his pleading for Cluentius,§ too, does not the conver­ <lb/>
            sation between Stalenus and Bulbus contribute greatly to the <lb/>
            rapidity of the narrative, and to its credibility ? And that he <lb/>
            may not be supposed to have fallen into this manner undesign <lb/>
            edly, (a supposition which is indeed wholly incredible with <lb/>
            regard to such an orator,) he recommends, in his Oratorical <lb/>
            Partitions, || that the statement of facts should display agreeable­ <lb/>
            ness, something to excite surprise and expectation, unexpected <lb/>
            results, conversations between different people, and all the feelings <lb/>
            of the mind. 108. Continued argumentation, as I observed,¶ <lb/>
            we must never use in our statement of facts; though we may <note type="footnote"> * Pro Cluent. c. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> + Servius Sulpicius, the friend of Cicero, a very celebrated lawyer, <lb/>
            is said to have spoken in defence of Aufidia, not only here, but in x. 1, <lb/>

            speech of his against Aufidia is mentioned; for we learn from x. 1, <lb/>
            116, and 7, 30, that there were only three of his speeches extant, and <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.IV. </note> <lb/>
            introduce a single argument occasionally, as Cicero does in his <lb/>
            speech for Ligarius,* when he says that he had governed his <lb/>
            province in such a way as made it expedient for him that there <lb/>
            should be peace. We may also introduce in our statement, <lb/>
            if the subject requires, a short defence of our client's con­ <lb/>
            duct, or a reason for it :for we are not to state things as a <lb/>
            witness, but as an advocate. 109. The simple account of a <lb/>
            fact may be such as this : Quintus Ligarius went into Africa as <lb/>
            lieutenant-general with Caius ConsidiuM. But how does Cicero <lb/>
            give it ? Quintus LigariM, when there was not even a suspicion <lb/>
            of war, went into Africa as lieutenant-general with Caius Con­ <lb/>
            sidius. 110. In another place, again, Heset out, not only to no war, <lb/>
            but not even upon the least suspicion ofwar.† When it was suffi­ <lb/>
            cient for him, too, in proceeding to state a fact, to say, Quin­ <lb/>
            tus Ligarius allowed himself to be involved in no transaction, he <lb/>
            adds, looking back to his home, and being desirous to return to his <lb/>
            friends. Thus what he stated he made credible by giving a reason <lb/>
            for it, and made a strong impression, at the same time, on the <lb/>
            feelings of his audience.‡ 111. 1 am the more surprised at <lb/>
            those, therefore, who think that we are not to touch the feel­ <lb/>
            ings in a statement of facts. If they mean, indeed, that we <lb/>
            are not to work on them long, or as in the peroration, they are <lb/>
            of the same opinion with myself; for tediousness is to be <lb/>
            avoided; otherwise, why should I not move the judge while I <lb/>
            am instructing him? 112. Why should I not secure, if <lb/>
            possible, at the very opening of my case, the object which I <lb/>
            am desirous to attain at the conclusion of it, especially as I <lb/>
            shall find his mind more manageable, when I come to proofs, <lb/>
            if it has previously been swayed by indignation or pity ? <lb/>
            113. Does not Cicero,§ in a very few words, touch all the <lb/>
            feelings by describing the scourging of a Roman citizen, not <lb/>
            only showing the condition of the sufferer, the place of the out­ <lb/>
            rage, the nature of the infliction, but extolling the spirit with <lb/>
            which he bore it? For he exhibits him as a man of great <lb/>
            magnanimity, who, when he was lashed with rods, uttered no <note type="footnote"> * C. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> + Pro Lig. c. 1, 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t Affectus quoque implevit.] Affectus, as Spalding observes, in in the <lb/>

            judges for Ligarius. </note><note type="footnote"> § In Verr. v. 62. </note> <pb n="297"/>
            <note type="margin"> on. n.J </note> <lb/>
            groan, and made no supplication, but only exclaimed that he was <lb/>
            a Roman citizen, to the disgrace of his oppressor, and with con­ <lb/>
            fidence in the laws. 114. Has he not also, through the whole <lb/>
            of his statement, excited the greatest detestation of the treat­ <lb/>
            ment of Philodamus,* and caused the tears of his audience to <lb/>
            overflow at his punishment, not so much relating that they <lb/>
            wept, as exhibiting them weeping, the father, that his son <lb/>
            was to die, and the son that his father was to die What <lb/>
            more touching could any peroration present? 115. It is <lb/>
            late, too, to bring the feelings, at the end of a speech, to <lb/>
            bear on particulars which we have previously narrated with <lb/>
            coolness; the judge has become familiarized to them, and <lb/>
            hears, without any excitement, that with which he was not <lb/>
            moved when it was new to him; and it is difficult for us to <lb/>
            change the temper of his mind when once it is settled. <lb/>
            116. For my own part, (for I will not conceal my opinion, <lb/>
            though that which I am going to say rests rather upon <lb/>
            experience than upon precepts,) I think that the statement of <lb/>
            facts requires, as much as any part of a speech, to be adorned <lb/>
            with all the attractions and grace of which it is susceptible. <lb/>
            But it makes a great difference what the nature of the case <lb/>
            which we state is. 117, In the smaller sort of cases, there­ <lb/>
            fore, such as private ones in general are, the garb of the <lb/>
            statement ought to be neat, and, as it were close-fitting; there <lb/>
            should be the greatest care with regard to words, which, when we <lb/>
            enlarge upon the common topics of morality,† are poured forth <lb/>
            with rapidity, and particular expressions are often lost in the <lb/>
            profusion of language in which they are enveloped; but here <lb/>
            every word ought to be expressive, and, as Zeno ‡ says, <lb/>
            tinctured with peculiar signification; the style should be appa­ <lb/>
            rently artless, but as agreeable as possible ; 118. there should be <lb/>
            no figures borrowed from poetry, and received on the authority <lb/>
            of the ancients contrary to the simplicity of language, (for the <lb/>
            diction should be as pure as possible,) but such only as lessen <lb/>
            tedium by variety, and relieve attention by change, so that we <lb/>
            may not fall into similar terminations, similar phrases, and <lb/>
            similar constructions ; for a statement has no other attractions, <note type="footnote"> * In Verri. 30. </note><note type="footnote"> t C. 1, sect. 59. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Zeno of Citium is doubtless meant. That he wrote on language <lb/>

            and, if it be not recommended by such graces, must fail to <lb/>
            please. 119. Nor is the judge in any part more attentive; and <lb/>
            consequently nothing that is expressed with effect is lost upon <lb/>
            him. Besides he is more inclined, I know not how, to believe <lb/>
            what gratifies his ear, and is led by being pleased to being <lb/>
            persuaded.</p>
          <p>120. But when the cause is of greater moment, it will be <lb/>
            proper to speak of heinous crimes in a tone of invective, and <lb/>
            of mournful occurrences in one of pity ; not that the topics for <lb/>
            exciting the feelings may be exhausted, but that an outline of <lb/>
            them, as it were, may be presented; and that it may at once <lb/>
            appear what the full picture of the case will be. 121. Nor <lb/>
            would I dissuade a speaker from reviving the strong feeling of­ <lb/>
            the judge, when exhausted with attention, by some remark, <lb/>
            especially if thrown in with brevity ; such, for instance, as <lb/>
            this : The servants of Milo did what every one would have <lb/>
            wished his servants to do in such circumstances; or occasionally, <lb/>
            perhaps, a'little more boldly, as this :* The mother-in-law mar­ <lb/>
            ries her son-in-law, without auspices, without any to sanction the <lb/>
            union, and with the most fatal omens. 122 As this practice was <lb/>
            adopted even in days when every speech was composed rather <lb/>
            for use than for show, and the judges were still more austere, <lb/>
            how much more aptly may it be done now, when pleasure has <lb/>
            made its way even into trials for life and fortune ? How far <lb/>
            we ought to conform to this taste of our age, I will give my <lb/>
            opinion in another place. § Meantime I allow that some con­ <lb/>
            cession is to be made to it.</p>
          <p>123 A probable representation of circumstances which appears <lb/>
            to conduct the audience, as it were, to a view of the case, has, <lb/>
            when subjoined to what is really true, a powerful effect; such, <lb/>
            for example, as the description given by Marcus Cselius‡of <lb/>
            Antonius.§ They || find him sunk in the sleep of drunkenness, <note type="footnote"> * Cic. pro Cluent. c. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> t Rollin and Gesner think that the preface to book viii. is meant; <lb/>

            companions were stretched across towards him from their several <lb/>
            couches, and the rest lying round in every direction; 124. who, <lb/>
            however, becoming aware of the approach of the enemy, at­ <lb/>
            tempted, half dead with terror, to awaken Antonius; they called <lb/>
            him aloud by name to no purpose; they raised his head; one <lb/>
            whispered gentle sounds into his ear; another struck him forcibly <lb/>
            with her hand; but when at length he became conscious of the voice <lb/>
            and touch of each, he only threw his arms round the neck of her <lb/>
            that was next to him; he could neither sleep after being roused, <lb/>
            nor keep awake from the effects of drunkenness; but was tossed <lb/>
            about, half asleep and half awake, in the hands of centurions and <lb/>
            harlots. Than this description nothing could be imagined more <lb/>
            probable; nothing offered as a greater subject of reproach; <lb/>
            nothing exhibited more vividly</p>
          <p>125. Nor can I omit to remark how much credit the authority <lb/>
            of the speaker gives to his statement; an authority which we <lb/>
            ought to secure chiefly by our general conduct, but also by our <lb/>
            style of oratory; since the more grave and serious it is, the <lb/>
            more weight it must give to our assertions. ] 26. We must <lb/>
            especially avoid, therefore, in this part of our speech, all <lb/>
            suspicion of artifice, (for nowhere is the judge more on his <lb/>
            guard,) so that nothing may appear fictitious or studied, but <lb/>
            that all may be thought to emanate rather from the cause than <lb/>
            from the advocate. 127. But this manner our modern pleaders <lb/>
            cannot tolerate ; we think that our art is lost if it is not seen, <lb/>
            whereas art, if it is seen, ceases to be art. We doat upon <lb/>
            praise, and think it the great object of out labour; and thus <lb/>
            betray to the judges what we wish to display to the by- <lb/>
            standers.</p>
          <p>128. There is also a sort of repetition of the statement, <lb/>
            which is called by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιδιήγησις</foreign> : a thing more com <lb/>
            mon in school declamations than in the forum. It was intro­ <lb/>
            duced with this object, that, as the statement of facts ought to <lb/>
            be brief, the case might afterwards be set forth more fully and <lb/>
            with more embellishment, in order to move indignation or <lb/>
            pity. To this retice I think that we should have recourse <lb/>
            but seldom, and never so as to repeat the whole order ot <lb/>
            circumstances; for we may effect the same object by recurring <lb/>
            to particulars here and there. Let him, however, that shall <pb n="300"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B IV </note> <lb/>
            determine on such repetition, touch but lightly on facts in his <lb/>
            statement, and, contenting himself with relating what has been <lb/>
            done, promise to explain more fully how it was done in the <lb/>
            the proper place.</p>
          <p>129. As to the commencement of a statement of facts, some <lb/>
            think that it ought to be made with reference to some charac­ <lb/>
            ter, whom, if he is on our side, we are to extol, and, if adverse <lb/>
            to us, to attack. This certainly is a very common mode of <lb/>
            proceeding, because on each side there are persons between <lb/>
            whom the dispute lies. 130. But they may sometimes be <lb/>
            introduced with descriptive circumstances, when such a course <lb/>
            is likely to be advantageous; as,* Aulus Cluentius Habitus, <lb/>
            judges, was the father of my client, a man who held the <lb/>
            highest position, not only in the municipal town of Larinum, in <lb/>
            which he was born, but in all that country and neighbourhood, <lb/>
            for his merit, reputation, and respectability of birth; sometimes <lb/>
            without them: as, when Quintus Ligarius had set out,† etc. <lb/>
            131. Sometimes, however, we may commence with a fact, as <lb/>
            Cicero in his speech for Tullius :‡ Marcus Tullius possesses an <lb/>
            estate inherited from his father in the territory of Thurium ;or <lb/>
            as Demosthenes § in behalf of Ctesiphon: For the Phocian <lb/>
            war having broken out, etc 132. As to the end of the state­ <lb/>
            ment, it is a matter of dispute with those who think that the <lb/>
            statement itself should be brought down to the point where the <lb/>
            question arises :ll as,¶ These things having thus happened, Pub­ <lb/>
            lius Dollabella the prætor published an edict, as is customary <lb/>
            with regard to violence and men appearing in arms, without any <lb/>
            exception, only that Æbutius should reinstate Cæcina in the <lb/>
            place from which he had expelled him. He said that he had <lb/>
            reinstated him. A sum of money was deposited; and it is con­ <lb/>
            cerning this deposit that you must decide. This can always be <lb/>
            done on the side of the prosecutor, but not always on that of <lb/>
            the defendant. <note type="footnote"> * Cic. Pro Cluent. c. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> + Cic. pro Ligar. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> t A fragment of a lost speech. Another fragment of it is given, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Of digressions or excursions immediately after the statement, § 1—3. <lb/>
            Not always unreasonable, 4—8. Some preparation often necessary <lb/>
            before proceeding to proof, 9—11. Digressions may be made in <lb/>
            any part of a speech, but those in the middle should be short, <lb/>
            12—17.</p>
          <p>1. IN the order of things the confirmation follows the <lb/>
            statement; for we must prove what we stated only that it <lb/>
            might be proved. But before I proceed to treat of this part, I <lb/>
            must make a few observations on the opinions of certain <lb/>
            rhetoricians.</p>
          <p>It is the custom of most speakers, when the order of facts is <lb/>
            set forth, to make a digression to some pleasing and attractive <lb/>
            moral topic, so as to secure as much favourable attention as <lb/>
            possible from the audience. 2. This practice had its rise in <lb/>
            the declamatory ostentation of the schools, and passed from <lb/>
            thence into the forum, after causes began to be pleaded not to <lb/>
            benefit the parties going to law, but to enable the advocates <lb/>
            to make a display; from apprehension, I suppose, that if the <lb/>
            stubbornness of argument should immediately follow the dry <lb/>
            conciseness of narrative, (such as is often necessary,) and the <lb/>
            gratification of eloquent diction should be too long withheld, <lb/>
            their whole oration would appear cold and repulsive. 3. To <lb/>
            this custom there is this objection, that the speakers indulge <lb/>
            in it without making due distinction of causes, and what par. <lb/>
            ticular causes require, but as if such displays of eloquence were <lb/>
            always expedient or even necessary; and in consequence they <lb/>
            force into their digression matters taken from other parts to <lb/>
            which they properly belong ; so that many things must either <lb/>
            be said over again, or, as they have been said in a place to <lb/>
            which they had no right, cannot be said in their own. 4. I <lb/>
            admit, however, that this sort of excursion may be advan­ <lb/>
            .tageously introduced, not only after the statement of the case, <lb/>
            but after the different questions in it, altogether or sometimes <lb/>
            severally, when the subject requires or at least permits it; and I <lb/>
            think that a speech is by such means greatly set off and em­ <lb/>
            bellished ; provided that the dissertation aptly follows and <lb/>
            adheres to what precedes, and is not forced in like a wedge, <lb/>
            separating what was naturally united. 5. For no part of a <lb/>
            speech ought to be more closely attached to any other part, <pb n="302"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV </note> <lb/>
            than the proof is to the statement; unless indeed the di. <lb/>
            gression be intended either as the end of the statement or as <lb/>
            the beginning of the proof. There will therefore sometimes <lb/>
            be room for it; for instance, if our statement, towards the con <lb/>
            elusion, contains something very heinous, we may enlarge upon <lb/>
            it, as if our indignation, like our breath, must necessarily have <lb/>
            vent. 6. This however ought to be done only when the matter <lb/>
            does not admit of doubt; else it is of more importance to make <lb/>
            your charge true than atrocious; because the enormity of an <lb/>
            accusation is in favour of the accused as long as it remains <lb/>
            unproved, for belief in the commission of a heinous crime is <lb/>
            extremely difficult. 7. A digression may also be made with <lb/>
            advantage, if, for example, when you have spoken of services <lb/>
            rendered to the opposite party, you proceed to inveigh against <lb/>
            ingratitude ; or if, when you have set forth a variety of charges <lb/>
            in your statement, you show how much danger in consequence <lb/>
            threatens yourself. 8. But all these must be signified briefly ; <lb/>
            for the judge, when he has learned the order of the facts, is <lb/>
            impatient for the proof of them, and desires as soon as possible <lb/>
            to settle his opinion. You must be cautious, also, that your <lb/>
            exposition of the case be not forgotten, through the attention <lb/>
            of the judge being turned to something else, or fatigued with <lb/>
            useless delay.</p>
          <p>9. But though such digression is not always a necessary <lb/>
            sequel to a statement of facts, it is yet frequently a useful <lb/>
            preparation for the consideration of the question; for instance, <lb/>
            if the case appears, at first sight, unfavourable to us; if we <lb/>
            have to uphold a severe law; if we enforce penal inflictions; <lb/>
            as there will then be room, as it were, for a second exordium, <lb/>
            to prepare the judge for our proofs, or to soothe or excite him ; <lb/>
            and this may be done the more freely and forcibly in this place, <lb/>
            as the case is already known to him. 10. With these lenitives, <lb/>
            so to speak, we may soften whatever is offensively hard in our <lb/>
            statement, that the ears of the judge may the more readily <lb/>
            admit what we may have to say afterwards, and that he may <lb/>
            not be averse to concede us justice ;* for judges are not easily <lb/>
            convinced of anything against their will. 11. On these oc­ <lb/>
            casions, however, the disposition of the judge must also be <lb/>
            ascertained, that we may know whether he is more inclined to <note type="footnote"> *Ne jus nostrum odcrint.] Ne nobis sint adversi propter j uris rigorem. </note> <pb n="303"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            / <lb/>
            law or to equity; for according to his inclination our repre­ <lb/>
            sentations will be more or less necessary.</p>
          <p>The same subject may also serve as a kind of peroration <lb/>
            after the question. 12. This part the Greeks call the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱέϰ­ <lb/>
            βασις</foreign> : the Latins the egressus or egressio. But such sallies, <lb/>
            as I remarked,* are of several kinds, and may be directed to <lb/>
            different subjects from any part of the cause; as eulogies of <lb/>
            men and places, descriptions of countries, recitals of occurrences <lb/>

            Cicero against Verres, are the praises of Sicily, and the rape oj <lb/>

            known celebration of the merits of Cneius Pompey, which the <lb/>
            divine orator, as if the course of his pleading had been sus­ <lb/>
            pended at the very name of the heroic leader, suddenly turns <lb/>
            aside to pronounce, breaking away from the matter on which <lb/>
            he had entered.</p>
          <p>14. As to the definition of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱέϰβασις</foreign>, it is, in my <lb/>
            opinion, a dissertation on any subject relating to the interest of the <lb/>
            cause, digressingfrom the order of facts. I do not see, therefore, <lb/>
            why they assign it to that part of a speech, above all others, which <lb/>
            immediately follows the statement of the case, any more than <lb/>
            why they think that name belongs to a digression only when <lb/>
            something is to be stated in it, as a speech may swerve from <lb/>
            the right path in so many ways. 15. For whatever goes <lb/>
            beyond those five parts of a speech which we have specified,∥ <lb/>
            is a- digression, whether it be an expression of indignation, pity, <lb/>
            detestation, reproach, apology, conciliation, or reply to invective.¶ <lb/>
            Similarly digressive is everything that does not lie within the <lb/>
            question ; all amplification, extenuation, and excitement of the <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> † C. 2, § 19. </note><note type="footnote"> t III. 7, 27. </note><note type="footnote"> § Of this speech only some fragments remain, which have been pre­ <lb/>

            are attached to cognate subjects, and naturally cohere with them, <lb/>
            do not appear to be digressions. 16. But there are numbers of <lb/>
            remarks introduced into matters that have no connexion with <lb/>

            on the spur of the moment, or from necessity ; if, for instance, <lb/>
            anything extraordinary occurs while we are speaking, as an <lb/>
            inter! uption, the sudden arrival of any person, or a disturbance. <lb/>
            17. From such a cause Cicero was obliged to make a digression <lb/>

            from the short speech! which he pronounced on the occasion. <lb/>

            Sometimes very useful, 3, 4. Various kinds of propositions, and <lb/>
            remarks on them, 5—9.</p>
          <p>1. THERE are some writers who place the proposition‡ <lb/>
            after the statement of facts, as a division of a speech on <lb/>
            any matter for judgment.§ To this notion I have already∥ <lb/>
            replied. In my opinion the commencement of any proof is a <lb/>
            proposition, which may be advanced not only in stating the <lb/>
            principal question, but sometimes even to introduce particular <note type="footnote"> * It is to be observed that I read ea maximè quæ jucundam et orna­ <lb/>

            arguments, especially those which are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχειϱήματα</foreign>.* <lb/>
            2 But I shall now speak of the former † kind. It is not <lb/>
            always necessary to use it; for sometimes what the point in <lb/>
            question is, is sufficiently manifest without any proposition <lb/>
            whatever; for instance, if the statements of facts ends where <lb/>
            the question begins; so that that which in arguments is com­ <lb/>
            monly the recapitulation,‡ is sometimes immediately subjoined <lb/>
            to the statement of the case: These things§ occurred, judges, <lb/>
            just as I have related them; the lier-in-wait was cut off; violence <lb/>
            was overcome by violence; or rather audacity was subdued by <lb/>
            valour. 3. But at times it is extremely useful; especially <lb/>
            when the fact cannot be denied, and the question is about the <lb/>
            definition: as, in pleading for him who took the money of a <lb/>
            private person from a temple, you would say, The consideration <lb/>
            is about sacrilege ; it is concerning sacrilege that you have to <lb/>
            decide; so that the judge may understand that his only duty is <lb/>
            to ascertain whether that which is charged against the accused <lb/>
            is sacrilege. 4. It is also of use in causes that are obscure or <lb/>
            complex, not only that they may be rendered more lucid, but <lb/>
            also, occasionally, that they may be more striking. A propo­ <lb/>
            sition will produce this effect, if there be immediately sub­ <lb/>
            joined to it something that may support our pleading: as, <lb/>
            A law has been made expressly, that whatever foreigner mounts <lb/>
            the wall is to be punished with death; that you are a foreigner <lb/>
            is certain; that you mounted the wall there is no doubt; <lb/>
            what remains, then, but that tou undergo the penalty? For <lb/>
            such a proposition enforces a confession from the opposite <lb/>
            party, and prevents, in a great measure, delay in giving judg­ <lb/>
            ment, not only explaining the question, but supporting it.</p>
          <p>5. Propositions are single, double, or complex; a distinction <lb/>
            which results from more than one cause; for several charges <lb/>
            may be combined, as when Socrates was accused of corrupt <lb/>
            ing the youth and introducing new superstitions; or one charge <lb/>
            may be established by several proofs, as when it was alleged <lb/>
            against Æschines that he had acted dishonestly in his em­ <note type="footnote"> * See v. 14, 14. </note><note type="footnote"> t That which concerns the principal question, or state of the cause. <lb/>

            bassy, because he had spoken falsely; because he had done <lb/>
            nothing in conformity with the directions given him ; became he <lb/>
            had tarried ; became he had accepted presents. 6. The defen ce may <lb/>
            also contain several propositions; as, in an action to recover a <lb/>
            debt it may be said, You have no right demand it; for it was <lb/>
            not in your power to become an agent;- nor had he, in whose <lb/>
            name you act, a right to have an agent; nor are tou the heir of <lb/>
            him from whom I am said to have borrowed; nor was I indebted <lb/>
            to him. 7. Such examples maybe multiplied at pleasure; but it is <lb/>
            sufficient to have pointed out that such is the case. If these <lb/>
            allegations are stated singly, with proofs subjoined, they are so <lb/>
            many distinct propositions; if they are combined, they come <lb/>
            under the head of partition.t</p>
          <p>8. A proposition is sometimes, also, entirely bare, as is <lb/>
            generally the case in conjectural causes : I accuse of murder; <lb/>
            I charge with theft; sometimes it is accompanied with a reason ; <lb/>
            as, Cairn Cornelius ‡ has been guilty of treason against the dig­ <lb/>
            nity of the tribunate; for he himself, when tribune of the people, <lb/>
            read his own law before the public assembly.§ The proposition <lb/>
            which we bring forward, too, is sometimes our own ; as, I ac­ <lb/>
            cuse this man of adultery; sometimes that of our adversary; as, <lb/>
            The charge against me is that of adultery; sometimes affecting <lb/>
            both parties; as, The question between my opponent and me is, <lb/>
            which of the two is the nearer of kin to a person who has died in­ <lb/>
            testate. Sometimes, moreover, we may couple opposite propo­ <lb/>
            sitions ; as, I say thus, my adversary thus.</p>
          <p>9. There is a way of speaking which has, at times, the force <lb/>
            of a proposition, though it is in reality not one; when, after <lb/>
            having made our statement of facts, we add, It is upon these <lb/>
            points that you are to decide; this being a kind of admo­ <lb/>
            nition to the judge to direct his attention more earnestly to <lb/>
            the case, and, being roused as by a touch, to observe that the <lb/>
            statement is ended and the proof commenced; so that, as we <note type="footnote"> * Procuratori tibi esse non licuit.] He that was infamid notatus could <lb/>

          <p>Partition of our matter generally useful, § 1—3. When it should be <lb/>
            omitted, 4—9. Examples from Cicero, 10—12. As to states of <lb/>
            conjecture and quality, 13—17. Artifices that may be used, 18— <lb/>
            21. Utility of partition, and the proper qualities of it, 22—28.</p>
          <p>1. PARTITION is the enumeration, according to their order,* <lb/>
            of our own propositions, or those of our adversary, or both; an <lb/>
            enumeration which some think that we should always make, <lb/>
            because, by its aid, the cause is rendered clearer, and the judge <lb/>
            more observant and attentive, if he knows exactly on what point <lb/>
            we are speaking, and on what points we intend to speak after­ <lb/>
            wards. 2. Some, on the other hand, think it dangerous to a <lb/>
            speaker, for two reasons: that some things, on which we promise <lb/>
            to speak, may escape our memory, and others, which we may have <lb/>
            omitted in our specification, may occur to us; but nothing of this <lb/>
            kind can happen except to one who is utterly deficient in ability, or <lb/>
            one who brings to his pleading nothing settled or premeditated. <lb/>
            3. Otherwise, what method is so plain and clear as that of a <lb/>
            proper division of our matter ? for it follows nature as a guide, <lb/>
            so as to be the greatest aid to the memory, to prevent us from <lb/>
            straying from our proposed course in speaking. I cannot, <lb/>
            therefore, agree with those who think that our partition should <lb/>
            not exceed three propositions. Doubtless, if it be too multi­ <lb/>
            farious, it will escape the recollection of the judge, and <lb/>
            perplex his attention; but it is not to be confined, as by a <lb/>
            law, to this or that number, when a cause way possibly require <lb/>
            more.</p>
          <p>4. There are other reasons why we should not always adopt <lb/>
            a partition; first, because most observations please better when <lb/>
            they appear to be conceived on the moment, and not to be <lb/>
            brought from home, but to spring from the subject itself as we <lb/>
            are discussing it; and hence the common expressions, I had <lb/>
            almost forgotten, It had escaped me, You aptly remind me, <note type="footnote"> * Ordine collata.] That is, regularly following one another; not <lb/>
            separate. Spalding. </note> <note type="footnote"> X2 </note> <pb n="308"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IV </note> <lb/>
            are by no means ill received. If you lay down your course of <lb/>
            proof before-hand, all pleasure of novelty is cut off from the <lb/>
            sequel of your speech. 5. Sometimes, too, the judge must be <lb/>
            misled, and wrought upon by various artifices, that he may <lb/>
            suppose something else to be intended than what is really our <lb/>
            object. A proposition is sometimes startling, and a judge. <lb/>
            if he sees it prematurely, dreads it as a patient dreads the <lb/>
            surgeon's instrument before an operation is performed ; but if, <lb/>
            without any proposition being advanced before-hand, our obser­ <lb/>
            vations come upon him when off his guard, and penetrate his <lb/>
            mind, without any warning, when wrapt up, as it were, in <lb/>
            itself, they will make him believe that which he would have <lb/>
            distrusted if we had advanced it at first. 6. Occasionally, <lb/>
            too, we should avoid not only the distinction of questions, but <lb/>
            the mention of them altogether; the judge should have his <lb/>
            feelings strongly moved, and his attention diverted; for to <lb/>
            instruct is not the only duty of an orator; the power of elo­ <lb/>
            quence is best shown in producing excitement But, to such <lb/>
            an effect, that minute carefulness in division, scrupulously <lb/>
            separated into parts, * at a time when we should endeavour to <lb/>
            deprive the judge of the power of deciding against us, is <lb/>
            directly opposed. 7. Are not arguments, also, that are light and <lb/>
            weak when detached, often of great force in a body? Such <lb/>
            arguments, accordingly, should rather be collected in a mass, <lb/>
            and we should make a sally with them, as it were, upon the <lb/>
            judge; an expedient which should rarely, however, be adopted, <lb/>
            and only in case of necessity, when reasoning forces us to that <lb/>
            which seems contrary to reasoning.† 8. In addition, it is to <lb/>
            be considered that there is, in every division of a case, some <lb/>
            one point of more importance than the rest, and when the <lb/>
            judge has become acquainted with it, he is apt to disdain other <lb/>
            points as requiring no notice. Consequently, if more charges <lb/>
            than one are to be established or overthrown, a partition is <lb/>
            both advantageous and agreeable ; in order that what we have <lb/>
            to say on each head may distinctly be shown; but if we have <note type="footnote"> * Tenuis illa et scrupulosa in partes secta divisionis diligentia.] Such <lb/>
            is the reading of Spalding, who observes that all the manuscripts, and <lb/>
            all editions before that of Badius Ascensius, have secta. Capperonier, <lb/>
            and most of the later editors, have adopted sectœ from Badius. Secta <lb/>
            diligentia is an expression with which we can hardly feel content, but, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            to combat one charge by various arguments, it is needless <lb/>
            9. Thus, if you should make such a division as this, I shall <lb/>
            show that the accused,for whom I plead, is not of such a character <lb/>
            that he can be thought to have committed murder ; I shall show <lb/>
            that he had no motive for committing murder; I shall show that <lb/>
            at the time the murder was committed he was beyond the sea, <lb/>
            all that you might prove before that which you place last, must <lb/>
            necessarily appear useless; 10. for the judge is anxious to come <lb/>
            to the strongest point of all; and if he is of a patient temper, <lb/>
            he will silently hold the advocate bound to adhere to his <lb/>
            stated division, or, if he be pressed with business, or be a man <lb/>
            of some dignity, or of rude manners, will call upon him, with <lb/>
            some reproachful remark, to adhere to it. 11. Some have <lb/>
            been found, accordingly, to disapprove of Cicero's partition in <lb/>
            his speech for Cluentius, where he promises, first of all, that <lb/>
            he will show that no man was ever brought to judgment for <lb/>
            greater crimes, or on stronger evidence, than Oppianicus ; next, <lb/>
            that the preliminary inquiries* were conducted by those very judges <lb/>
            by whom he was condemned; lastly, that the judgment was influ­ <lb/>
            enced by money, not on the side of Cluentius, but by the opposite <lb/>
            party; such a division being needless, because, if the third point <lb/>
            could be proved, there was no necessity for introducing the <lb/>
            first or second. 12. On the other hand, no one will be so <lb/>
            unjust or foolish as not to admit that Cicero adopted an excel­ <lb/>
            lent division in his pleading for Muræna : I perceive, judges, <lb/>
            that of the whole accusation there are three heads ; one concerned <lb/>
            with censure of my client's morals; another with his competition <lb/>
            for honours ; and a third with charges against him for bribery; <lb/>
            fur he thus exhibits the cause with the utmost clearness, and <lb/>
            does not render one head useless by another.</p>
          <p>13. Most writers also hesitate respecting the following mode <lb/>
            of defence: If I killed the man, I killed him justly; but <lb/>
            I did not kill him ;† for "to what purpose," it is asked, <lb/>
            “ is the first proposition, if the second can be proved? they <lb/>
            are at variance with one another, and while we advance both, <lb/>
            credit is given to neither." This is indeed partly true ; as we <lb/>
            ought to rest on the second only, provided it be incontro­ <lb/>
            vertible. 14. But if we have any apprehension as to the <note type="footnote"> * Præjudicia.] See book v. a. 1 and 2, and Smith'a Diet. of Or. and <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.IV </note> <lb/>
            stronger, we may very well use the support of both ; for dif­ <lb/>
            ferent judges are moved by different arguments; and he who <lb/>
            believes that the deed was done, may think it just; while he who <lb/>
            will not allow it to be just, will perhaps feel convinced that it <lb/>
            was not done. An unerring hand may be content with one <lb/>
            javelin, but, by an uncertain band, several should be thrown, in <lb/>
            order that chance may have its influence. 15. Cicero, in <lb/>
            defending Milo, shows admirably, in the first place, that <lb/>
            Clodius was a Her in-wait, and then adds, superabundantly as <lb/>
            it were, that even if he had not been so, a citizen of such <lb/>
            a character might have been slain with great merit and <lb/>
            honour on the part of the slayer. 16. Yet I would not <lb/>
            altogether condemn that order which I just now mentioned ;* <lb/>
            because some arguments, though hard in themselves, may yet <lb/>
            be of use to soften others that are to follow. The common <lb/>
            saying, that we must ask more than what is just in order <lb/>
            to get what is just,† is not without foundation in reason. <lb/>
            17. No one, however, is to take it in such a sense as to suppose <lb/>
            that everything may be attempted ; for the Greeks very wisely <lb/>
            instruct us that what cannot be accomplished ought not to be tried. ‡ <lb/>
            But whenever we adopt that double mode of defence of which <lb/>
            I am speaking, we ought to make it our object to draw from <lb/>
            the first head confirmation for the second; for he who might <lb/>
            even have confessed without danger, may appear to have no <lb/>
            motive for speaking falsely when he denies.</p>
          <p>IS. We must also take good care, whenever we suspect that <lb/>
            the judge desires some other proof than that which we are ad­ <lb/>
            vancing, to promise that we will fully and speedily afford him <lb/>
            satisfaction on the point; especially if it affects our client's <lb/>
            honour. 19. But it frequently happens that a cause, in itself <lb/>
            far from honourable, is supported by the letter of the law; and, <lb/>
            in this case, that the judges may not listen with unwillingness or <lb/>
            disapprobation, they must be often reminded that the vindica­ <lb/>
            tion of the integrity and honour of our client will follow ; <lb/>
            that they have but to wait a little, and allow us to proceed <lb/>
            in order. 20. We may pretend also, occasionally, to say <lb/>
            some things against the wish of our client, as Cicero does <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 13. r </note><note type="footnote"> t See Erasmus, Chiliad. ii. 3, 26, who thinks that the saying was <lb/>
            originally used of people offering goods for sale. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Diog. Laert. i. 70. </note> <pb n="311"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            in his speech for Cluentius, in regard to the law respecting <lb/>
            the duties of judges ;* sometimes we may stop, as if we were <lb/>
            interrupted by our client; sometimes we may address our <lb/>
            selves to him, and entreat him to allow us to take our <lb/>
            own course. 21. Thus we shall gradually make an im­ <lb/>
            pression on the mind of the judge; who, while he trusts that <lb/>
            the honour of our client is going to be vindicated, will listen <lb/>
            with less reluctance to our more startling arguments; and, <lb/>
            when he has received some impression from these, the main­ <lb/>
            tenance of our clients honour will be the easier for us. Thus <lb/>
            the two points will support each other; and the judge, trusting <lb/>
            to our vindication of character, will be more attentive to the <lb/>
            point of law, and, the point of law being established, will be <lb/>
            more disposed to listen to our vindication of character.</p>
          <p>22. But though partition is not always necessary, or even <lb/>
            advantageous, yet, when it is seasonably adopted, it contributes <lb/>
            great lucidity and agreeableness to a speech; for it not only <lb/>
            causes what is stated to become clearer, by drawing certain <lb/>
            particulars out of the crowd, as it were, and placing them full <lb/>
            in the sight of the judges, but relieves the attention by fixing <lb/>
            a definite termination to certain parts, as distances on a road, <lb/>
            marked by inscribed stones, appear greatly to diminish the <lb/>
            fatigue of travellers. 23. For it is a gratification to learn the <lb/>
            measure of the labour which we have acomplished; and to <lb/>
            know how much remains, encourages us to proceed with greater <lb/>
            spirit to the conclusion; nothing, indeed, need seem long, <lb/>
            when it is understood where the end is. 24. It was not without <lb/>
            justice that Quintus Hortensius gained great praise for his <lb/>
            exactness in division; though Cicero ‡ sometimes gently <lb/>
            laughs at his partitions as being counted upon his fingers; <lb/>
            for, as there is moderation requisite in gesture,- so we should, <lb/>
            even with greater reason, avoid a too precise, and, as it were, <lb/>
            jointed, division of our matter. 25. Minute sections, which, <lb/>
            instead of being members, are bits, detract greatly from the <note type="footnote"> * This law, observes Gesner, respecting the bribery of judges, was <lb/>

            such distinction, are apt, that they may be thought to have <lb/>
            made nice and numerous divisions, to introduce what is wholly <lb/>
            superfluous, and to cut asunder what is naturally united; <lb/>
            they make their parts, not so much more in number, as less <lb/>
            in bulk; and, after a thousand partitions, fall into that very <lb/>
            obscurity against which partition was invented.</p>
          <p>26. The proposition of a cause, whether divided or single, <lb/>
            ought, whenever it can be introduced with advantage, to be, <lb/>
            above all, plain and clear; (for what can be more disgraceful <lb/>
            than to make that obscure which is adopted for no other pur­ <lb/>
            pose than that other parts may not be obscure ?) and it should <lb/>
            also be brief, and not loaded even with a single useless word; <lb/>
            for we must remember that we have not to show what we are <lb/>
            saying, but what we are going to say. 27. We must be <lb/>
            cautious, too, that nothing may be deficient in it, and nothing <lb/>
            redundant. The most frequent cause of redundancy is, when <lb/>
            we divide into species what it would be sufficient to divide <lb/>
            into genera; or when, after mentioning the genus, we add <lb/>
            species to it, as if we should speak of virtue, justice, temperance, <lb/>
            when justice and temperance are but species of virtue.</p>
          <p>28. The first step in partition is, to distinguish what is ad­ <lb/>
            mitted and what is disputed. Next, in regard to what is <lb/>
            admitted, to distinguish what our adversary admits, and what <lb/>
            we admit; and, in respect to what is disputed, to specify what <lb/>
            our propositions are, and what those of our opponent. But <lb/>
            what is most culpable, is, not to treat of your several points in <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Some rhetoricians have thought that the only duty of an orator is to <lb/>
            teach; others have called this his chief duty. The necessity for <lb/>
            this book.</p>
          <p>1. THERE have been authors,* and some, indeed, of high <lb/>
            reputation, who have thought that the sole duty of an orator is to <lb/>
            inform.† Excitement of the feelings, they considered, was to <lb/>
            be prohibited, for two reasons; first, because all perturbation <lb/>
            of the mind is an evil ‡ and, secondly, because it is inexcusable <lb/>
            for a judge to be diverted from the truth by pity, anger, or any <lb/>
            similar passion ; and to aim at pleasing the audience, when the <lb/>
            object of speaking is to gain victory, they regarded not only as <lb/>
            needless in a pleader, but scarcely worthy even of a man. <lb/>
            2. Many, too, who doubtless did not exclude those arts from <lb/>
            the department of the orator, considered, nevertheless, that his <lb/>
            proper and peculiar office was to establish his own propositions <lb/>
            and to refute those of his adversary. 3. Whichsoever of these <lb/>
            opinions is right, (for I do not here offer my own judgment,) <lb/>
            this book must appear, in the estimation of both parties, ex­ <lb/>
            tremely necessary, as the entire subject of it is proof and <lb/>
            refutation; to which all that has hitherto been said § on <lb/>
            judicial causes is subservient. 4. For there is no other object <lb/>
            either in an introduction or a narrative than to prepare the judge; <lb/>
            and to know the state.∥ of causes, and to contemplate all the <lb/>
            other matters of which I have treated above,¶ would be use­ <lb/>
            less, unless we proceed to proof. 5. In fine, of the five parts.. <lb/>
            into which we have distinguished judicial pleading, whatever <lb/>
            other may occasionally be unnecessary in a cause, there cer­ <lb/>
            tainly never occurs a suit in which proofisnot required.</p>
          <p>As to directions regarding it, I think that I shall make the <note type="footnote"> * The commentators rightly refer to Aristotle, Rhet. i. 1. 4.

            best division of them, by first showing what are applicable to <lb/>
            all kinds of questions, and next, by enlarging on what are pecu <lb/>
            liar to the severalsorts of causes.*</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. IN the first place, then, the division which has been laid <lb/>
            down by Aristotle t has gained the approbation of almost all <lb/>
            rhetorreians ; namely, that there are some proofs which an <lb/>
            orator adopts that are unconnected with the art of speaking, and <lb/>
            others which he himself extracts, and, as it were, produces,from <lb/>
            his cause. Hence they have called the one sort <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄτεχνοι</foreign>, “ in­ <lb/>
            artificial," and the other <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔντεχνοι</foreign>, " artificial." 2. Of the former <lb/>
            kind, are precognitions, public reports, evidence extracted by <lb/>
            torture, writings, oaths, and the testimony of witnesses, with <lb/>
            which the greater part of forensic pleadings are wholly con­ <lb/>
            cerned. But though these species of proof are devoid of art in <lb/>
            themselves, they yet require, very frequently, to be supported <lb/>
            or overthrown with the utmost force of eloquence; and those <lb/>
            writers, therefore, appear to me highly deserving -of blame, who <lb/>
            have excluded all this kind of proofs from the rules of art. 3. It <lb/>
            is not, however, my intention to collect all that is usually said <lb/>
            for and against these points ; for I do not design to lay down <lb/>
            common places, which would be a task of infinite labour, but <lb/>
            merely to point out a general method and plan. The way <lb/>
            being shown, each must exert his ability, not only to follow it, <lb/>
            but to find out similar courses, as the nature of particular <lb/>
            cases may require; since no one can speak of all kinds of <lb/>
            causes, even among such as have occurred, to say nothing of <lb/>
            such as may occur. <note type="footnote"> * That is, of judicial causes. There is no reference here, as <lb/>

          <p>Previous judgments. The authority of those who deliver them to be <lb/>
            considered. Similitude in cases; how to be refuted.</p>
          <p>1. As to precognitions, the whole matter of them ranges <lb/>
            itself under three heads; first, cases which have been already <lb/>
            decided under similar circumstances, and which may more <lb/>
            properly be termed precedents; as about wills of fathers which <lb/>
            have been annulled or ratified in opposition to their children; <lb/>
            secondly, judgments relative to the cause itself, (from which <lb/>
            also is derived the name,) such as those which are said to <lb/>
            have been pronounced upon Oppianicus*, and those of the senate <lb/>
            upon Milo; † or, thirdly, when sentence has already been given <lb/>
            on the same affair, as in the case of persons that have been <lb/>
            sent out of the country,‡ of appeals in regard to personal <lb/>
            liberty,§ and of divisions in the judgments of the centum viri, <lb/>
            when they have been separated into two parties.∥ 2. Precog­ <lb/>
            nitions are established chiefly by two things; the authority of <lb/>
            those who have given judgment, and the similitude of the cases <lb/>
            in question; as for the annulling of them, it is rarely obtained <lb/>
            by reproaching the judges, unless there be a manifest error in <lb/>
            them; for each of the judges wishes the sentence of another to <lb/>
            stand firm, remembering that he himself is also to pronounce a- <lb/>
            sentence, and being unwilling to offer a precedent which may <lb/>
            recoil upon himself. 3. The pleader must have recourse, <note type="footnote"> * Cicero pro eluent. c. 17, seqq.

            therefore, in the first two cases, if the matter allow, to the dis­ <lb/>
            covery of some dissimilarityin the cases; (and there is scarcely <lb/>
            one exactly like another in all particulars;) or,if that course <lb/>
            be impossible, or the cause be the same, some negligence in <lb/>
            thepleadings must xosed,or we must complain of the <lb/>
            weakness of theparties against whom judgment was given, or <lb/>
            influence that corrupted the witnesses, or of public odium, or <lb/>
            ignorance ; or we must find something that has since occurred <lb/>
            to affect4. If none of these allegations be possible, <lb/>
            we may observe that many motives on trials have led to unjust <lb/>
            sentences, and that through such influence Rutilius* was con­ <lb/>
            demned, and Clodius and Catiline† acquitted. The judges may <lb/>
            also be solicited rather to examine thequestion themselves <lb/>
            than to rest their faith on the verdict of others. 5. But <lb/>
            against decrees of thesenate, andthe ordinances of princes or <lb/>
            magistrates, there is no remedy, unless some difference, how­ <lb/>
            ever small, be discovered in the cases, or some subsequent de­ <lb/>
            termination of the same persons,or personages of the same <lb/>
            dignity, at variance with the former. If nothing of the kind oe <lb/>
            discoverable, there will be no case for judgment. <note type="footnote"> * See xi. 1, 12. Publius Rutilius Rufus was found guilty of extor­ <lb/>
            tion, A.U.C. 662, in consequence of a conspiracy of the publicani against <lb/>
            him, he having defended Asia from their injustice. Hia property, <lb/>
            being confiscated, was found to be too small to pay the fine laid upon <lb/>
            him, and, at the same time, to have been obtained by the most <lb/>
            honourable means. He went into voluntary exile at Mitylene, and <lb/>
            afterwards at Smyrna, where he received the highest honour from all <lb/>
            the people of Asia, and was presented with greater wealth than he <lb/>
            had previously possessed. See Dion Cass. p. Reim. 44. He was a <lb/>
            Stoic, and pupil of Panætius, and Seneca frequently mentions him in <lb/>
            conjunction with Socrates as an example of wisdom and fortitude in <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>1. THE case is similar with regard to evidence exacted by <lb/>
            torture, which is a frequent subject of discussion ; as one side <lb/>
            will call torture an infallible means for discovering truth, the <lb/>
            other will represent it as a cause of the utterance of falsehood; <lb/>
            because to some persons ability to endure makes lyingeasy, to <lb/>
            others weakness renders it necessary.* To what purpose <lb/>
            should I say more on this subject? The pleadings of the <lb/>
            ancients and the moderns are alike full of instances. 2. Yet <lb/>
            under this head there will be circumstances peculiar to certain <lb/>
            cases ; for if the question be about applying the torture, it will <lb/>
            make a great difference who it is that demands it, and whom he <lb/>
            demands or offers for it, and against whom, and from what <lb/>
            motive; or, if the torture has been applied, who presided at it, <lb/>
            who it was that was tortured, and how; whether he uttered what <lb/>
            was incredible or consistent; whether he persisted in his first asser­ <lb/>
            tions, or made any change in them; whether he confessed at the <lb/>
            commencement of the torture, or after it had proceeded for some <lb/>

          <p>1. AGAINST writings, too, pleaders have often spoken, and <lb/>
            must often speak, as we know that it is common for documents <lb/>
            not only to be set aside, but to be charged with being forged. <lb/>
            As there must, in the latter case, be either guilt or ignorance <lb/>
            on the part of those who signed them, ignorance will be the <lb/>
            safer and lighter charge; because the number of those whom <lb/>
            we actually accuse will be smaller. 2. But the whole of <lb/>
            such a proceeding- must rest on arguments drawn from the <lb/>
            particular case; if, for example, it is difficult to prove, or even <lb/>
            incredible, that what the writing states occurred; or if (as <lb/>
            more frequently happens) it may be overthrown by proofs <lb/>
            equally in artificial ; if he to whose prejudice the deed was <lb/>
            signed, or any one of those who signed it, can be said to have <lb/>
            been absent at the time, or to have died before it; if dates <lb/>
            disagree; or if anything that occurred before or after is at <lb/>
            variance with what is written. Even a mere inspection is <lb/>
            often sufficient to discover forgery.</p>

            rienced respecting it, 6.</p>
          <p>I. As to an oath, parties going to law either offer theirown, <lb/>
            or refuse to receive that of their adversary when offered ; or <lb/>
            they require one from him, or refuse to take one when required <lb/>
            from themselves. For a person to offer to take an oath himself, <lb/>
            without allowing his opponent to take his, is commonly a sign <lb/>
            of bad faith. 2. He, however, who shall do so, must either <lb/>
            shelter himself under such purity of moral conduct as to make <lb/>
            it incredible that he will commit perjury,-or under the influ­ <lb/>
            ence of religion; (in regard to which he will gain more credit <lb/>
            if he act in such a manner as not to appear to come forward <note type="footnote"> * Hoc ipsum.] By these words he means omne refellendi ct accusandi <lb/>

            with eagerness to take his oath, and yet not to shrink from <lb/>
            taking it;) or on the small importance of the cause, should <lb/>
            such be its nature, for the sake of which he would hardly incur <lb/>
            the divine displeasure; or if, in addition to other means of <lb/>
            gaining his cause, he offers his oath, superabundantly, as it <lb/>
            were, as the testimony of a pure conscience.</p>
          <p>3. He who shall be unwilling to receive the oath of his <lb/>
            adversary, will allege the inequality of the terms, and remark <lb/>
            that the fear of taking an oath is lightly regarded by many, as <lb/>
            even philosophers have been found to deny that the gods pay <lb/>
            any attention to human affairs; and that he who is ready to <lb/>
            a wear without any one putting him to his oath, is disposed to <lb/>
            give sentence himself in his own cause, and to show how light <lb/>
            and easy a thing he considers the obligation by which he offers <lb/>
            to bind himself. 4. But he who offers to accept his adver­ <lb/>
            sary's oath, besides appearing to act with moderation, as he <lb/>
            makes his opponent the arbiter of the cause, relieves the judge <lb/>
            also, to whom the decision belongs, from a heavy responsibility, <lb/>
            since he would certainly rest rather on another man's oath than <lb/>
            on his own.† 5. Hence the refusal to take oath becomes the more <lb/>
            difficult, unless the affair in question happens to be such that it <lb/>
            cannot be supposed to be known to the party. If this excuse <lb/>
            be wanting, there will be but one course left for him, which is <lb/>
            to say that odium is sought to be excited against him by his <lb/>
            opponent, whose object is to make it appear that he has <lb/>
            ground for complaint in a cause in which he cannot obtain vic­ <lb/>
            tory ; land, accordingly, though a dishonest man would have <lb/>
            eagerly availed himself of such a proposal, he himself would <lb/>
            rather prove what he asserts than leave it doubtful in the mind <lb/>
            of any one whether he were guilty of perjury.</p>
          <p>6. But, in my younger days, men who had grown old in <lb/>
            pleading used to lay it down as a rule that we should never give <lb/>
            our opponent the.option of taking his oath; as also that he <lb/>
            should never be allowed the choice of a judge ;‡ and that a judge <note type="footnote"> * If he himself is at the pains of bringing forward many arguments <lb/>

          <p>1. THE greatest efforts of pleaders, however, are employed <lb/>
            about evidence. Evidence is given either in writing, or by wit­ <lb/>
            nesses present in court. The opposition to writings is the more <lb/>
            simple ; for shame may seem to have had less preventive power <lb/>
            in the presence of only a few witnesses,t and absence may be <lb/>
            unfavourably represented as intimating self distrust. If the <lb/>
            character of the writer is open to no reflection, we may per­ <lb/>
            haps throw some --discredit on that of the witnesses to it. <lb/>
            2. Besides, a secret feeling is entertained unfavourable to all <lb/>
            who offer evidence in writing, as no man gives it inthat way <lb/>
            unless of his own free-will, ‡ and thus" shows that he is no <lb/>
            friend to the party against whom he deposes. Yet a pleader <lb/>
            on the opposite side should not be ready to- admit that a friend <lb/>
            may not speak truth on behalf of a friend, or an enemy against <note type="footnote"> * Ex advocatis.] By this word we are not to understand pleaders, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH.VII.] </note> <lb/>
            an enemy, if the credit of either be unimpeached. But the <lb/>
            subject, in both its bearings, furnishes much matter for con­ <lb/>
            sideration.</p>
          <p>3. With witnesses who are present there may be great con­ <lb/>
            tention, and we accordingly engage, whether against them or <lb/>
            for them, with the double force of regular speeches * and inter­ <lb/>
            rogatories 4. In regular speeches, we commonly offer obser­ <lb/>
            vations, first of all, for and against witnesses in general. This <lb/>
            is a common topic for argument; one side maintaining that <lb/>
            there is no evidence stronger than that which rests on human <lb/>
            knowledge, and the other, to detract from the credit of such <lb/>
            knowledge, enumerating every cause by which testimony is <lb/>
            rendered false. 5. The next step is, when pleaders make special <lb/>
            attacks, though on bodies of men; for we know that the testi­ <lb/>
            monies of whole nations have been invalidated by orators, as <lb/>
            well as whole classes of evidence; as in the case of hear-say <lb/>
            witnesses, for pleaders maintain that they are not in reality wii­ <lb/>
            nesses, but mere reporters of the words of unsworn individuals ; <lb/>
            and in cases of extortion, those who swear that they have paid <lb/>
            money to the accused, are to be regarded as parties in the <lb/>
            prosecution, not as witnesses. 6. Sometimes a pleader's re­ <lb/>
            marks are directed against individual witnesses; a kind of <lb/>
            attack which we find in many pleadings, sometimes combined <lb/>
            with a defence, and sometimes given separately, as that of Cicero <lb/>
            on the witness Vatinius.†</p>
          <p>7. Let me therefore consider the whole subject, as I have taken <lb/>
            upon myself to attempt the entire education of an orator; <lb/>
            otherwise, the two boobs composed on this head by Domitius <lb/>
            Afer‡ would have been sufficient, a rhetorician whom I at­ <lb/>
            tended with great respect when he was old and I was young, <lb/>
            so that the contents of his books were not only read by me, <lb/>
            but learned from his own mouth. He very justly makes it a <lb/>
            rule that it is the great business of an orator, in regard to this <lb/>
            part of his cause, to gain a thorough knowledge of the whole of <lb/>
            it; but it is a rule to be observed in regard to every part. <note type="footnote"> * Actionum.] Compare sect. 8, where oratio perpetua is used as <lb/>

            8. How this knowledge may be attained, I shall show when I <lb/>
            arrive at the part of my work destined for that subject.* Such <lb/>
            knowledge will suggest matter for questions, and supply, as it <lb/>
            were, weapons to the hand; and it will also show us for what <lb/>
            the mind of the judge should be prepared by our speech; as it <lb/>
            is by a regular address that the credit of witnesses should be <lb/>
            either established or overthrown ; since every judge is affected <lb/>
            by testimony just as he has been previously influenced to <lb/>
            believe or disbelieve it.</p>
          <p>9. Since, then, there are two sorts of witnesses, those who <lb/>
            appear voluntarily, and those whom the judge commonly sum­ <lb/>
            mons on public trial according to law, (of the first of which <lb/>
            kinds either party may avail themselves, while the latter is <lb/>
            conceded only to accusers,) let us distinguish the duty of the <lb/>
            pleader who produces witnesses from that of him who refutes <lb/>
            their testimony.</p>
          <p>10. He that produces a voluntary witness, may know what <lb/>
            he has to say, and consequently appears to have the easier <lb/>
            task in examining him. But even this undertaking requires <lb/>
            penetration and watchfulness ; and we must be cautious that <lb/>
            the witness may not appear timid, or inconsistent, or foolish ; <lb/>
            11. for witnesses are confused, or caught in snares, by the ad­ <lb/>
            vocates on the opposite side, and, when they are once caught, <lb/>
            they do more harm than they would have done service if they <lb/>
            had been firm and resolute. They should therefore be well <lb/>
            exercised before they are brought into court, and tried <lb/>
            with various interrogatories, such as are likely to be put <lb/>
            by an advocate on the other side. By this means they will <lb/>
            either be consistent in their statements, or, if they stumble at <lb/>
            all, will be set upon their feet again, as it were, by some op­ <lb/>
            portune question from him by whom they were brought forward. <lb/>
            12. But even in regard to those who are consistent in their <lb/>
            evidence, we must be on our guard against treachery; for they <lb/>
            are often thrown in our way by the opposite party, and, after <lb/>
            promising everything favourable, give answers of a contrary <lb/>
            character, and have the more weight against us when they do <lb/>
            not refute what is to our prejudice, but confess the truth of it. <lb/>
            13. We must inquire, therefore, what motives they appear <lb/>
            to have for declaring against our adversary; nor is it sufficient <lb/>
            to know that they were his enemies; we must ascertain <note type="footnote"> * a xii. a 3. </note> <pb n="323"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VILJ </note> <lb/>
            whether they have ceased to be so; whether they may not <lb/>
            seek reconciliation with him at our expense; whether they <lb/>
            have been bribed; or whether they may not have changed their <lb/>
            purpose from penitential feelings; precautions, not only neces­ <lb/>
            sary in regard to witnesses who know that which they intend <lb/>
            to say is true, but far more necessary in respect to those who <lb/>
            promise to say what is false.* 14. For they are more likely to <lb/>
            repent, and their promises are more to be suspected; and even <lb/>
            if they keep to their word, it is much more easy to refute them.</p>
          <p>15. Of witnesses who are summoned to give evidence, some <lb/>
            are willing to hurt the accused party, and some unwilling; <lb/>
            and the accuser some mes knows their inclination, and is some­ <lb/>
            times ignorant of it. Let us suppose for the moment that he <lb/>
            knows it; yet, in either case, there is need of the greatest <lb/>
            circumspection on the part of him who examines them. 16. If <lb/>
            he find the witness disposed to prejudice the accused, he ought <lb/>
            to take the utmost care that his disposition may not show <lb/>
            itself; and he should not question him at once on the <lb/>
            point for decision, but proceed to it circuitously, so that <lb/>
            what the examiner chiefly wants himto say, may appear to <lb/>
            be wrung from him. Nor should he press him with too many <lb/>
            interrogatories, lest the witness, by replying freely to every­ <lb/>
            thing, should invalidate his own credit; but he should draw <lb/>
            from him only so much as it may seem reasonable to elicit <lb/>
            from one witness. 17. But in the case of one who will not <lb/>
            speak the truth unless against his will, the great happiness in <lb/>
            an examiner is, to extort from him what he does not wish te <lb/>
            say; and this cannot be done otherwise than by questions that <lb/>
            seem wide of the matter in hand; for to these he will give <lb/>
            such answers as he thinks will not hurt his party; and then, <lb/>
            from various particulars which he may confess, he will be re­ <lb/>
            duced to the inability of denying what he does not wish to <lb/>
            acknowledge. 18. For as, in a set speech, we commonly col­ <lb/>
            lect detached arguments, which, taken singly, seem to bear <lb/>
            but lightly on the accused, but by the combination of which <note type="footnote"> * Rollin wishes Quintilian to be thought guiltless of tolerating, or <lb/>
            rather recommending, dishonesty and fraud, referring us to sect. 32 of <lb/>
            this chapter. But I fear that RoBin has no just ground for what he <lb/>
            says ; for in all that Quintilian here remarks about witnesses, (see espe­ <lb/>
            cially sect. 26,) there are not many indications of a desire to adhere to. <lb/>
            strict probity. Spalding, </note> <note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note> <pb n="324"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V. </note> <lb/>
            we succeed in proving the charge, so a witness of this kind <lb/>
            must be questioned on many points regarding antecedent an <lb/>
            subsequent circumstances, and concerning placed, times, persons, <lb/>
            and other subjects; so that he may be brought to give some <lb/>
            answer; after which he must either acknowledge what we wish, <lb/>
            or contradict what he himself has said. 19. If we do not suc­ <lb/>
            ceed in that object, it will then be manifest that he is unwilling <lb/>
            to speak; and he must be led on to other matters, that he may <lb/>
            be caught tripping, if possible, on some point, though it be <lb/>
            unconnected with the cause; he may also be detained an ex­ <lb/>
            traordinary time, that by saying everything, and more than the <lb/>
            case requires, in favour of the accused, he may make himself <lb/>
            suspected by the judge; and he will thus do no less damage <lb/>
            to the accused than if he had stated the truth against him- <lb/>
            20. But if (as we supposed in the second place) the accuser <lb/>
            be ignorant of the witness's disposition, he must sound his <lb/>
            inclination cautiously, interrogating him, as we say, step by <lb/>
            step, and leading him gradually to the answer which is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to be elicited from him. 21. But as there is sometimes <lb/>
            such art in witnesses, that they answer at first according to an <lb/>
            examiner's wish, in order to gain greater credit when they <lb/>
            afterwards speak in a different way, it is wise in an orator to <lb/>
            dismiss a suspected witness before he does any harm.</p>
          <p>22. For advocates that appear on behalf of defendants, the <lb/>
            examination of witnesses is in one respect more easy, and in <lb/>
            another more difficult, than for those who are on the side of the <lb/>
            prosecutor. It is more difficult on this account, that they can <lb/>
            seldom or ever know, before the trial, what the witness is going <lb/>
            to say; and it is more easy, inasmuch as they know, when he <lb/>
            comes to be questioned, what he has said. 23. Under the un­ <lb/>
            certainty, therefore, which there is in the matter, great caution <lb/>
            and inquisition is necessary, to ascertain what sort of character <lb/>
            he is that prosecutes the defendant; what feeling he enter­ <lb/>
            tains against him; and from what motivon: and all such <lb/>
            matters are to be exposed and set aside in our pleading, <lb/>
            whether we would have the witnesses appear to have been insti­ <lb/>
            gated by hatred, or by envy, or by desire of favour, or by money. <lb/>
            If the opposite party, too, produce but few witnesses, we may <lb/>
            reflect on their small number; if they are extraordinarily <lb/>
            numerous, we may insinuate that they are in conspiracy; if <lb/>
            they are of humble rank, we may speak with contempt of their <pb n="325"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.VII.] </note> <lb/>
            meanness; if persons of consequence, we may deprecate their <lb/>
            influence. 24. It will be of most effect, however, to expose <lb/>
            the motives on which the witnesses speak against the defen­ <lb/>
            dant, which may be various, according to the nature of causes <lb/>
            and the parties engaged in them ; for to such representations <lb/>
            as I have just mentioned, the opposite party can answer with <lb/>
            common-place arguments ; as, when the witnesses are few and <lb/>
            humble, the prosecutor can boast of his simple honesty, in <lb/>
            having sought for none but such as were acquainted with the <lb/>
            case in hand; while to commend a large number, or persons of <lb/>
            consideration, isa somewhat easier task. 25. But occasionally, <lb/>
            as we have to commend witnesses, so we have to decry them, <lb/>
            whether their testimony be read in our pleading, or they be <lb/>
            summoned to give it personally.. Such attempts were more <lb/>
            easy and frequent in the times t when the witnesses were not <lb/>
            examined after the pleading was ended. As to what we should <lb/>
            say against the witnesses respectively, it can only be drawn <lb/>
            from their individual characters.</p>
          <p>26. The manner of questioning witnesses ‡ remains to be <lb/>
            considered. In this part of our duty, the principal point is to <lb/>
            know the witness well; for if heistimid,he may be frightened; <lb/>
            if foolish, misled; if irascible, provoked ; if vain, flattered; if <lb/>
            prolix, drawn from the point. If, on the contrary, a witness is <lb/>
            sensible and self-possessed, he may be hastily dismissed, as ma­ <lb/>
            licious and obstinate; or he may be confuted, not with formal <lb/>
            questioning, but with a short address from the defendant's advo­ <lb/>
            cate; or he may be put out of countenance, if opportunity offer, <lb/>
            by a jest; or, if anything can be said against his moral charac­ <lb/>
            ter, his credit may be overthrown by infamous charges. 27. It <lb/>
            has been advantageous, on certain occasions, not to press too <unclear/> <lb/>
             <note type="footnote"> * Aut recitatis in actione aut nominatis testibus.] Gesner hesitates <lb/>
            how to interpret this passage ; Spalding observes that it is manifestly <lb/>
            corrupt. Gesner inquires whether recitatis testibus may be equivalent <lb/>
            to recitatis eorwn testimoniis; but for such interpretation there is no <lb/>
            authority. Spalding thinks that we should read aut recitatis in actione <lb/>

            of any other writers. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ On the side of the defendant. Quintilian has already made many <lb/>
            observations concerning the examination of witnesses, but with respect <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. v. </note> <lb/>
            severely on men of probity and modesty; for those who would <lb/>
            have fought against a determined assailant are softened by <lb/>
            gentle treatment.</p>
          <p>Every question is either about some point within the cause<lb/>
            Or on some point without it. On matters within the cause, <lb/>
            the advocate of the accused, as we also directed the accuser, <lb/>
            may frequently, by putting questions a little widely, and on <lb/>
            subjects from which no suspicion will arise, and by comparing <lb/>
            previous with subsequent answers, reduce witnesses to such a <lb/>
            dilemma as to extort from them against their will what may <lb/>
            be of service to his own cause. 28. On this point there is <lb/>
            certainly no instruction or exercise given in the schools ; and <lb/>
            excellence in it depends rather on natural acuteness, or expe­ <lb/>
            rience, than anything else. If any model, however, ought <lb/>
            to be pointed out for imitation, the only one that J can <unclear>recom­</unclear> <lb/>
            end is that which may be drawn from the dialogues of the <lb/>
            Socratic philosophers, and especially Plato, in which the ques­ <lb/>
            tions are so artful, that, though the respondent answers <lb/>
            correctly to most of them, the matter is nevertheless brought to <lb/>
            the conclusion which the questioner wishes to establish. 29. For­ <lb/>
            tune sometimes favours us, by causing something to be said by <lb/>
            a witness that is inconsistent with the rest of his evidence; <lb/>
            and sometimes (as more frequently happens) she makes one <lb/>
            witness say what is at variance with the evidence of another; <lb/>
            but an ingenious mode of interrogation will often lead metho­ <lb/>
            dically to that which is so frequently the effect of chance.</p>
          <p>30. On matters without the cause, also, many serviceable <lb/>
            questions are often put to a witness; as concerning the character <lb/>
            of other witnesses ; concerning his own ; whether anything dis­ <lb/>
            honourable or mean can be laid, to the charge of any of them ; <lb/>
            whether they have any friendship with the prosecutor, or <lb/>
            enmity against the defendant; in replying to which they are <lb/>
            likely to say something of which we may take advantage, or <lb/>
            may be convicted of falsehood or malevolence. 31. But all <lb/>
            questioning ought to be extremely circumspect, becausea wit­ <lb/>
            ness often utters smart repartees in answer to the advocates, <lb/>
            and is thus regarded witha highly favourable feeling by the <lb/>
            audience in general. Questions should be put, too, as far as <lb/>
            possible, in familiar language, that the person under exami­ <lb/>
            nation, who is very frequently illiterate, may clearly under­ <note type="footnote"> * Beat17, 18. </note> <pb n="327"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            stand, or at least may not pretend that he does not understand; <lb/>
            an artifice which throws no small damp on the spirit of the <lb/>
            examiner.</p>
          <p>32. As to those disgraceful practices of sending a suborned <lb/>
            witness to sit on the benches of the opposite party, that in <lb/>
            being called from thence he may do him the more damage, <lb/>
            either by speaking directly against the person on whose side <lb/>
            he had placed himself, or by assuming, after having appeared <lb/>
            to benefit him by his evidence, airs of impudence and folly, by <lb/>
            which he not only discredits his own testimony, but detracts <lb/>
            from the weight of that of others who may have been of service; <lb/>
            I mention them, not that they may be adopted, but that they <lb/>
            may be shunned.</p>
          <p>There is frequently a collision between written attestations <lb/>
            on the one side and the witnesses who appear in person on the <lb/>
            other; and this furnishes matter of debate for both parties; <lb/>
            the one resting their arguments on the oaths of the witnesses, <lb/>
            and the other on the unanimity of those who signed the depo­ <lb/>
            sitions. 33. There is often a question, too, between the wit­ <lb/>
            nesses and the arguments; it being argued, on the one side. <lb/>
            that there is in the witnesses knowledge of facts and regard <lb/>
            for their oaths, and in the arguments nothing but mere <lb/>
            subtlety; on the other side, that witnesses are procured by <lb/>
            favour, fear, money, malice, hatred, friendship, or solicitation, <lb/>
            while arguments are drawn from the nature of the subject; <lb/>
            that in hearing witnesses the judge trusts to himself, in listen­ <lb/>
            ing to arguments, to another. 34. Such questions are common <lb/>
            to numbers of causes ; they have always been, and always will <lb/>
            be, subjects for violent discussion.</p>
          <p>Sometimes there are witnesses on both sides, and the ques­ <lb/>
            tion arises, with regard to themselves, Which of them are the <lb/>
            most respectable ? with regard to the cause, Which of them <lb/>
            have given the most credible evidence ? and, with regard to the <lb/>
            litigating parties, Which may have had most influence over the <lb/>
            witnesses ?</p>
          <p>35. To these kinds of evidence, if any one wishes to add what <lb/>
            are called supernatural testimonies, from responses, oracles, <lb/>
            and omens, let him be reminded that there are two modes of <lb/>
            treating them, the one general, in respect to which there is an <lb/>
            eternal dispute between the Stoics and Epicureans, whether the <lb/>
            world is governed by a divine providence; the other special, in <pb n="328"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.T. </note> <lb/>
            reference to- certain parts! of supernatural evidence, as they <lb/>
            happen severally to affect the question. 36. For the credit of <lb/>
            oracles may be established or overthrown in one way, and that <lb/>
            of soothsayers, augurs, diviners, and astrologers, in another, as <lb/>
            the nature of the things themselves is entirely different.</p>
          <p>In supporting or demolishing such circumstances in a cause <lb/>
            the voice of the pleader has much to do; as if, for instance, <lb/>
            expressions have been uttered under the effects of wine, or in <lb/>
            sleep, or in madness, or if information has been caught from <lb/>
            the mouth of children for in regard to all such individuals, <lb/>
            one party will say that they do not feign, and the other that <lb/>
            they mean nothing.</p>
          <p>37. The mode of proof by witnesses may not only be offered <lb/>
            with great effect, but may also be greatly missed where it is <lb/>
            not produced: You gave me the money: who counted it ? <lb/>
            where? whence did he come ? You accuse me of poisoning: where <lb/>
            did I buy the poison ? from whom ? for how much ? by whose <lb/>
            agency did I administer it ? who had any knowledge of the deed? <lb/>
            Almost all these points Cicero discusses in his speech for <lb/>
            Cluentius under a charge of poisoning.</p>
          <p>Such are the remarks which I have ventured to offer, as <lb/>
            briefly as I could, concerning inartificial proofs.</p>

            ments, as repulsive and rugged, repose themselves in more <lb/>
            agreeable spots, and, (like those who are said by the poets, on <lb/>
            being charmed with the taste of a certain herb among the <lb/>
            Lotophagi, or with the song of the Sirens, to have preferred <lb/>
            pleasure to security,) while pursuing an empty semblance of <lb/>
            glory, fail to obtain that success for which eloquence is <lb/>
            exerted.</p>
          <p>2 But other efforts of oratory, which run through the <lb/>
            continued course of a speech, are designed as aids or embellish­ <lb/>
            ments to the arguments of a cause, and add to those sinews, <lb/>
            by which it is strengthened, the appearance of a body, as it <lb/>
            were, superinduced upon them ; so that if anything is said to <lb/>
            have been done, perchance, through anger, or fear, or covet­ <lb/>
            ousness, we can expatiate somewhat fully on the nature of those <lb/>
            passions ; and, in similar accessory parts, we praise, blame, <lb/>
            exaggerate, extenuate, describe, deter, complain, console, ex­ <lb/>
            hort. 3. Such oratorical efforts may be of great service <lb/>
            in treating matters which are certain, or of which we speak <lb/>
            as being certain; and I would not deny that there is <lb/>
            some advantage in pleasing, and very much in exciting <lb/>
            the feelings; but pleasure and excitement have the most <lb/>
            effect when the judge thinks that he has acquired a full <lb/>
            knowledge of the cause; knowledge which we cannot convey <lb/>
            to him but by arguments and by every other means in support <lb/>
            of facts.</p>
          <p>4. But before I distinguish the different sorts of artificial proofs, <lb/>
            I think it necessary to intimate that there are certain qualities <lb/>
            common to all kinds of proof. For there is noquestion which <lb/>
            does not relate either to a thing or to a person ; nor can there <lb/>
            be any grounds for argument, except respecting matters that <lb/>
            affect things or persons ; and these matters are either to be <lb/>
            considered by themselves or referred to something else; 5. nor <lb/>
            can there be any proof except from things consequent or oppo­ <lb/>
            site,* which we must seek either in the time that preceded the <note type="footnote"> * Aut ex consequentibus aut ex repugnantibius.] Regius thought that <lb/>
            in this passage ought to be inserted ex antecedentibus in conformity with <lb/>
            Aristotle Analyt. prior. i. 27; and we may observe that Quintilian <lb/>
            himself, vi. 3, 66, in speaking of the topics from which laughter may <lb/>
            be elicited, specifies consequents, antecedents, and opposites. So, too, <lb/>
            Cic. Topic. c. 4 and 12, and De Orate ii. 39But the omission of <lb/>
            ex antecedentibus is supported by two other passages of Quintilian, v. </note> <pb n="330"/>

            alleged fact, in the time at which it took place, or in the time <lb/>
            that followed it; nor can anything be proved but from some <lb/>
            other thing, which must either be greater or less than it, or <lb/>
            equal to it. 6. As for arguments, they arise either from general <lb/>
            questions, which may be considered in themselves, apart from <lb/>
            from any connexion with things or persons, or from the cause <lb/>
            itself, when anything is found in it not derived from common <lb/>
            reasoning,* but peculiar to that point on which the decision is <lb/>
            to be pronounced. Of all conclusions, moreover, some are <lb/>
            necessary, some probable, some not impossible.</p>
          <p>7. Of all proofs,--or, there are four forms. Because one <lb/>
            thing is, another is not: as, It is day, therefore it is not night; <lb/>
            because there is one thing, there is also another: as, The sun <lb/>
            is above the earth, therefore it is day; because one thing is not, <lb/>
            another is : as, It is not night, therefore it is day; because one <lb/>
            thing is not, another is not: as, He is not a rational being, <lb/>
            therefore he is not a man. Having promised these general re­ <lb/>

          <p>Difference of signs, indications, or circumstantial evidence, from proofs, <lb/>
            § 1, 2. Of conclusive signs or indications, 3—7. Inconclusive <lb/>
            signs are of weight when supported by others, 8—11. Of mere <lb/>
            appearances, 12—-14. Of prognostics, 15, 16.</p>
          <p>1. ALL artificial proof, then, depends on indications, or argu­ <lb/>
            ments, or examples. I am aware that indications are thought <lb/>
            by many t a species of arguments ; and I had, in consequence, <lb/>
            two motives for distinguishing them ; the first, that indications <lb/>
            generally, almost always, belong to inartificial proofs; for <lb/>
            a blood-stained garment, a shriek, a livid spot, and similar par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, are circumstances of the same nature as writings, <lb/>
            reports, and depositions; they are not invented by the orator, <lb/>
            but communicated to him with the cause itself; 2. the second, <note type="footnote">10, 2, v. 14, 1, 25 ; and he appears to make it sufficiently evident that <lb/>
            he intended to include antecedentia in consequentia, (see v. 10, 76,) as <lb/>
            Regius himself indeed thought likely to be the case. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> * Not from reasoning common to all causes. Capperonier </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero Topic, c. 4, 12. </note> <pb n="331"/>

            that neither can indications, if they are certain, be arguments, <lb/>
            because, where there are certain indications, there is no ques­ <lb/>
            tion, and there can be no room for argument except upon a <lb/>
            controverted point; nor, if they are uncertain, can they be <lb/>
            arguments,. but have themselves need of arguments.</p>
          <p>3. All artificial proofs, then, as I say,. are distinguished, <lb/>
            first of all, into two kinds, one in which the conclusion is <lb/>
            necessary, the other in which it is not necessary. The <lb/>
            former are those which cannot be otherwise, and which the <lb/>
            Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεϰμήρια</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλυτα</foreign> ;these scarcely seem <lb/>
            to me to come under the rules of art; for when there <lb/>
            is an irrefutable indication, there can be no aground for dis­ <lb/>
            pute. 4. This Happens whenever a thing must be, or must <lb/>
            have been; or cannot be, or cannot have been; and this being <lb/>
            stated in a cause, there can be no contention about the point. <lb/>
            5. This kind of proofs is considered with reference to all times, <lb/>
            past, present, and future ; for that she who has had a child \ <lb/>
            must have lain with a man regards the past ; that there must be <lb/>
            waves when a strong wind has fallen on the sea, concerns the <lb/>
            present; and that he whose heart is wounded must die, relates <lb/>
            to the future.‡ In like manner it is impossible that there can <lb/>
            be harvest where there has been no sowing; that a person can be <lb/>
            at Rome when he is at Athens; or that he who is without a scar <lb/>
            can have been wounded with a sword. 6 Some have the same <lb/>
            force when reversed; as, a man who breathes must be alive, and <lb/>
            a man who is alive must breathe; but others are not reversible; <lb/>
            for it does not follow that, because he who walks must move, <lb/>
            therefore he who moves must walk. 7. It is consequently possible <lb/>
            that she who has not had a child may have had connection with <lb/>
            a man; that where there are waves, there may yet be no wind on <lb/>
            the sea; that the heart of him who dies may not have been <lb/>
            wounded ; and, in like manner, that there may have been sowing, <lb/>
            when there was no harvest; that he who was not at Athens, may <lb/>
            not have been at Rome; and that he who is marked with a scar <lb/>
            may not have been wounded with a sword. <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t The reader may think it a whimsical observation, but I cannot <lb/>

            is no absclutely necessary conclusion, and' which the Grreeks <lb/>
            call <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰϰότα</foreign> : these, though they are not sufficient of themselves <lb/>
            to remove all doubt, yet, when they are combined with others, <lb/>
            are of great weight.</p>
          <p>9. That from which something else is inferred, as from <lb/>
            blood is suspected murder, the Greeks term, as I said, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημει̃ον</foreign>, <lb/>
            that is, signum, sign;" though some of our writers have <lb/>
            used the word indicium, "an indication," and others vesti­ <lb/>
            gium, 'a trace. Butasthe blood that stained a garment <lb/>
            may have proceeded from a sacrifice or may have flowed <lb/>
            from the nose, it does not necessarily follow that he who has <lb/>
            a blood-stained garment has committed a murder. 10. Yet, <lb/>
            though it is not a sufficient proof of itself, still, when <lb/>
            combined with other circumstances, it cannot but be regarded <lb/>
            as evidence; as if the man with the blood-stained garment <lb/>
            was the enemy of him who was killed; if he had previously <lb/>
            threatened his life; if he was in the same place with him; to <lb/>
            which circumstances when some presumptive proof is added, <lb/>
            it makes what was suspected appear certain. 11. Among such <lb/>
            indications, however, there are some which either side may in­ <lb/>
            terpret in its own way, as livid spots, and swelling of the body; <lb/>
            for they may seem to be the effects either of poison or intem­ <lb/>
            perance,. and a wound in the breast, from which people may <lb/>
            argue that he in whom it is found has perished either by his <lb/>
            own hand or by that of another. The strength of such indi­ <lb/>
            cations is proportioned to the support which they receive from <lb/>
            other circumstances.</p>
          <p>12. Of indications, which are presumptions indeed, but <lb/>
            from which no necessary conclusion follows, Hermagoras thinks <lb/>
            the following an example: Atalanta is not a virgin, because she <lb/>
            strolls through the woods with young men, If we admit such a <lb/>
            circumstance as a presumption, I fear that we shall make <lb/>
            everything that has any reference to a fact a presumption. <lb/>
            Such circumstances are however treated by rhetoricians as pre­ <lb/>
            sumptive proofs. 13. Nor do the Areopagites, when they con­ <lb/>
            demned a boy to death for picking out the eyes of quails,* <lb/>
            appear to have had any other thought than that such an act was <note type="footnote"> * This story I have not seen mentioned elsewhere. The boy might <lb/>

            the indication of a cruel disposition, likely to do mischief to <lb/>
            many if he should be allowed to reach maturity. Hence also <lb/>
            the popularity of Spurius Mælius and Marcus Manlius was re­ <lb/>
            garded as an indication that they were aspiring to sovereignty. <lb/>
            14. But I am afraid that this mode of reasoning would carry <lb/>
            us too far; for if. a woman's bathing with men is a sign that <lb/>
            she is an adulteress, it will be a sign of the same nature if she <lb/>
            takes her meals with young men, or if she enjoys the intimate <lb/>
            friendship of any man; as a person might perhaps call a depi­ <lb/>
            lated skin, a sauntering walk, and a delicate dress, signs of <lb/>
            effeminacy and unmanliness, if he thinks that they proceed <lb/>
            from corrupt morals, as blood flows from a wound; a sign being <lb/>
            properly that which, proceeding from a matter about which <lb/>
            there is a question, falls under our own observation. 15. Those <lb/>
            appearances, also, which, as they are constantly noticed, are <lb/>
            vulgarly called signs, such as prognostics of the weather, The <lb/>
            golden moon is red from the approach of wind, and The mis­ <lb/>
            chievous crow calls for rain with a loud voice,* may, if they <lb/>
            have their causes from the state of the atmosphere, receive <lb/>
            that appellation; 16. for if the moon is red from the influence <lb/>
            of wind, its redness is a sign of wind; and if, as the same <lb/>
            poet infers, a condensed or rarefied atmosphere gives rise to a <lb/>
            chattering of birds,! we shall consider such chattering also a <lb/>
            sign. Wo may likewise observe that small things are some­ <lb/>
            times signs of great, as this very chattering of the crow; that <lb/>
            greater things are signsof less, nobody wonders. <note type="footnote"> * Virg. Georg. i. 431, 388. </note><note type="footnote"> t Virg. Georg. L 419. </note> <pb n="334"/>

          <p>Of the different names given to arguments among the Greeks and <lb/>
            Latins, § 1—8. Various significations of the word argument, <lb/>
            9—11. In every cause there must be something that does not <lb/>
            require proof, 12-14. Of credibilities, 15—19. Of sources from <lb/>
            which arguments are drawn, 20—22. From the character of <lb/>
            individuals, 23—81. From circumstances, as motives, place, <lb/>
            time, manner, 32—48. Opportunities and means, 49—52. Argu­ <lb/>
            ments from definition, 53—61. Remarks on Cicero's method; <lb/>
            argument and definition assisted by division, 62—70 Arguments <lb/>
            from commencement, increase, and event, 71, 72. From dissi­ <lb/>
            militude, opposition, consequentiality, 73—79. From causes and <lb/>
            effects, 80—85. From comparison, 86—89. Too many sub­ <lb/>
            divisions under this head, 90—94. Arguments from supposition, <lb/>
            95—99. Precepts not to be followed too superstitiously; ex­ <lb/>
            amples, 100—108. An orator must take care what he proposes <lb/>
            to be proved; an example, 109—118. Utility of rules, 119—121. <lb/>
            Necessity and advantages of study and practice, 122—125.</p>
          <p>1. I NOW proceed to speak of arguments; for under this term <lb/>
            we include all that the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνθυήματα, ἐπιχειήματα</foreign>, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποδείξεις</foreign>, of which, though there is some difference in the <lb/>
            names, yet the meaning is nearly the same. The word enthy­ <lb/>
            mema, (which we translate, indeed, as we cannot render it <lb/>
            otherwise, by commentum or commentatio, but we had better <lb/>
            use the Greek word itself,) has three meanings; one, which <lb/>
            signifies everything that is conceived in the mind ; (but with <lb/>
            this meaning we have now no concern;) another, which signi­ <lb/>
            fies a proposition with a reason$ 2. a third, which signifies a <lb/>
            conclusion of an argument, deduced from consequents or oppo­ <lb/>
            sites ;* although with regard to this sense'authors differ ; for <lb/>
            some call a conclusion from consequents an epicheirema; but <lb/>
            more will be found of opinion that a conclusion from opposites† <lb/>
            only should be called an enthymeme; and hence Cornificius <lb/>
            gives it the appellation contrarium. 3. Some have called it a <lb/>
            rhetorical syllogism, others an imperfect syllogism, because it <lb/>
            is not comprised in distinct parts, or in the same number of <lb/>
            parts, as the regular syllogism, such exactness, indeed, not <lb/>
            being required in the orator.</p>
          <p>4. Valgius: calls the epicheirema aggressio, "attempt." <note type="footnote"> * See c. 8, sect. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> † Compare v. 14, 2; viii. 5, 9; Cicero Topic. c. 18. </note><note type="footnote"><lb/>

            Census thinks that it is not our management of the subject,. <lb/>
            but the subject itself which we attempt, (that is, the argument <lb/>
            by which we propose to prove anything, and which, though not <lb/>
            yet set forth in words, is fully conceived in the mind,) that is <lb/>
            called an epicheirema. 5. Others are of opinion that it is not <lb/>
            an intended or imperfect proof, but a complete one, proceeding <lb/>
            even to the last species,† that ought to receive this appella. <lb/>
            tion ; and hence its proper acceptation, and that which is most <lb/>
            in use, is that in which it is understood to be a certain com­ <lb/>
            prehension of a thought which consists at least of three parts. ‡, <lb/>
            6. Some have called an epicheirema a reason,§ Cicero, || more <lb/>
            happily, a reasoning ; although he seems to have taken that <lb/>
            name rather from the syllogism than from anything else; for <lb/>
            he calls the status syllogisticus If a “ ratiocinatory state," and <lb/>
            gives examples from the philosophers ; and, as there is some <lb/>
            affinity between the syllogism and the epicheirema, he may be <lb/>
            thought to have adopted that term judiciously.</p>
          <p>7. As to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόδειξις</foreign>, it is an evident proof; and hence the <lb/>
            term <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαμμιϰαὶ ἀπὸδεις</foreign>, " linear demonstrations," among <lb/>
            geometers. Cæcilius thinks that it differs from the epichei­ <lb/>
            rema only in the manner of its conclusion, and that an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπό­ <lb/>
            δειξις</foreign> is an imperfect epicheirema, for the same reason for <lb/>
            which we said an enthymeme differs from a syllogism; for <lb/>
            an enthymeme is a part of a syllogism. Some think that the <lb/>
            apodeixis is included in the epicheirema, and is the part of it <lb/>
            which contains the proof. 8. But authors, however different <lb/>
            in other respects, concur in defining both of them so far simi­ <lb/>
            larly, as to say that the reasoning in them is from that which <lb/>
            is certain in order to give confirmation to that which is doubt­ <lb/>
            ful ; a quality which is common to all arguments, for what is <lb/>
            certain is never deduced from what is uncertain. To all these <note type="footnote"> * Nostram administrationem.] Capperonier aptly refers us to ii. 18, <lb/>

            forms of argument the Greeks give the general name cf <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστεις</foreign>, <lb/>
            which we might by a literal interpretation render fides, "faith;' <lb/>
            but we shall make the sense of it clearer if we call it proof</p>
          <p>9. But the word argument has itself also several signifi­ <lb/>
            cations ; for the subjects of plays,* composed for acting on the <lb/>
            stage, are called arguments; Asconius Pedianus, in explaining <lb/>
            the topics of the orations of Cicero, says The argument is this : <lb/>
            Cicero † himself, in writing to Brutus, says, "Fearing lest I <lb/>
            should bring from thence any evil upon my Cato, though the <lb/>
            argument was far from similar," etc.; whence it appears that <lb/>
            every subject for writing is so called. 10. Nor is this wonderful, <lb/>
            when the word is common even among artisans ;t Virgil § also <lb/>
            has argumentum ingens, " a great argument;" and a work of any <lb/>
            considerable number of heads is vulgarly called argumentosum, <lb/>
            " argumentative." But we have now to speak of that sense of <lb/>
            the word argument, which includes proof, indication, credibility, <lb/>
            aggression, which are all used as names for the same thing, <lb/>
            but, in my opinion, with too little distinction. 11. For proof <lb/>
            and credibility are established not only by arguments dependent <lb/>
            on reasoning, but by such as are called inartificial. As to signs, <lb/>
            which Celsus || calls indications, I have already distinguished ¶ <lb/>
            them from arguments.</p>
          <p>Since, then, an argument is a process of reasoning affording a <lb/>
            proof, by which one thing is gathered from another, and which <lb/>
            establishes what is doubtful by reference to what is certain, there <lb/>
            must assuredly be something in a cause that does not require <lb/>
            proof; for unless there be something which is true, or which <lb/>
            appears true, and from which support may be gained for what <lb/>
            is doubtful, there will be no ground on which we can prove <lb/>
            anything. 12. As certainties, accordingly, we have, in the first <lb/>

            respect is to be paid to parents ; 13. also, what is established <lb/>
            by the laws, or what is passed into general usage, with the <lb/>
            concurrence, if not of the whole world, at least of that com­ <lb/>
            munity or people among whom we have to plead, as indeed, in <lb/>
            what is called legal right, most points are settled, not by posi­ <lb/>
            tive laws, but by common custom; and, lastly, whatever is <lb/>
            agreed between the two parties, whatever is proved, or what­ <lb/>
            ever our adversary does not dispute, 14. For thus will arise <lb/>
            an argument, As the world is governed by a providence,* the <lb/>
            state ought to be governed by some ruling power ; showing that <lb/>
            if it is acknowledged that the world is governed by a providence, <lb/>
            the state ought likewise to be governed. 15. But to him who <lb/>
            would handle arguments properly, the nature and quality of all <lb/>
            things whatever ought to be known, as well as their general <lb/>
            effects; for it is by such knowledge that arguments called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰϰότα</foreign>, " probable," are established. 16. Now of probability <lb/>
            there are three degrees; one, which rests on very strong <lb/>
            grounds, because that to which it is applied generally happens, <lb/>
            as that children are loved by their parents ; a secon ,somewhat <lb/>
            more inclined to uncertainty, as that he who is in good health <lb/>
            to-day will live till to-morrow ; a third, which is only not repug­ <lb/>
            nant to credibility, as that a theft committed in a house was <lb/>
            committed by one of--the household. 17. Hence it is that <lb/>
            Aristotle, in his second book on the Art of Rhetoric,! has so <lb/>
            carefully considered what generally attends on various things and <lb/>
            persons, and what things or what persons nature has rendered <lb/>
            friendly or unfriendly to other things or other persons; as, what <lb/>
            accompanies riches, or ambition, or superstition ; what the good <lb/>
            approve ; what the bad pursue ; what soldiers or husbandmen de <lb/>
            sire ; and by what means things are severally shunned or sought. <lb/>
            18. But this subject I do not intend to pursue ; for it is not <lb/>
            only long, but even impracticable, or rather infinite; and it is <lb/>
            plain, moreover, to the common understanding of all. If any <lb/>
            one shall desire, however, to be enlightened upon it, I have <lb/>
            shown him from whom‡ he may seek instruction. 19. But <lb/>
            all probability, on which the far greater part of reasoning de­ <lb/>
            pends, flows from sources of this nature, whether it be credible <lb/>
            that a father was killed by his son; that a father committed <note type="footnote"> * Comp. c. 7, sect. 35. </note><note type="footnote"> t In the first seventeen chapters. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Aristotle. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <pb n="338"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            incest with his daughter; and, again, whether poisoning be <lb/>
            credible in a step-mother, or adultery in a man of licentious life , <lb/>
            also, whether it be credible that a crime was committed in the <lb/>
            sight of the whole world, or that false testimony was given for a <lb/>
            small bribe; because each of these crimes proceeds from a <lb/>
            peculiar cast, as it were, of character; I mean generally, not <lb/>
            always, else all reasoning about them would be absolute cer­ <lb/>
            tainty, and not mere probable argument.</p>
          <p>SO. Let us now examine the places of arguments ; although, <lb/>
            indeed, the topics of which I have previously spoken* are re­ <lb/>
            garded as places of argument by some rhetoricians. By places, <lb/>
            let me observe, I mean, not common places, in the sense in <lb/>
            which the word is generally understood, in reference to luxury, <lb/>
            adultery, or such subjects; but the seats of arguments, in which <lb/>
            they lie concealed, andfrom which they must be drawn forth. <lb/>
            21. For as all kinds of fruits are not produced in all countries, <lb/>
            and as you will be unable to find a bird or a beast, if you are <lb/>
            ignorant where it is usually produced or makes its abode, and <lb/>
            as, among the several kinds of fishes, some delight in a smooth <lb/>
            and others in a rocky bottom of the water, while particular sorts <lb/>
            are confined to particular regions or coasts, and you could not <lb/>
            attract the ellops ‡ or the scarus§ to our shores, so every kind of <lb/>
            argument is not to be got from every place, and is consequently <lb/>
            not everywhere to be sought; 22. otherwise there would be <lb/>
            much wandering about, and, after enduring the utmost labour, <lb/>
            we should not be able to find, unless by chance, that for which <lb/>
            we should seek without method. But if we ascertain where <lb/>
            particular arguments offer themselves, we shall, when we come <lb/>
            to the place where they lie, easily discern what is in it.</p>
          <p>23. First of all, then, arguments are to be drawn from <lb/>
            persons; there being, as I said,|| a general division of all <lb/>
            arguments into two kinds, those which concern and <lb/>
            those which concern persons; and the accidents of things being <lb/>
            cause, time, place, opportunity, instruments, manner, and the <note type="footnote"> * In the preceding chapter. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t 11. 4, 22 ; v. 12, 16; 13, 57. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ A fish that was thought a delicacy by the ancients. Some have <lb/>

            like. As to persons, I do not undertake to treat of every <lb/>
            particular concerning them, as most rhetoricians have done, <lb/>
            but only of those topics from which arguments may be drawn. <lb/>
            24. These, then, are, birth, for people are mostly thought <lb/>
            similar in character to Their fathers and forefathers, and some­ <lb/>
            times derive from their origin motives for living an honour­ <lb/>
            able or dishonourable life; nation, for every nation has its <lb/>
            peculiar manners, and the same thing will not be alike pro­ <lb/>
            bable in regard to a Barbarian, a Roman, and a Greek; <lb/>
            25. country, for, in like manner, the laws, institutions, and <lb/>
            opinions of states have their peculiarities; sex, for you would <lb/>
            more readily believe a charge of robbery with regard to a <lb/>
            man, and poisoning with regard to a woman; age, for differ­ <lb/>
            ent modes of action belong to different periods of life ; educa­ <lb/>
            tion and discipline, for it makes a difference by whom, and in <lb/>
            what manner a person has been brought up ; 26. bodily consti­ <lb/>
            tution, for beauty is often drawn into an argument for litTer­ <lb/>
            tinism, and strength for insolence, and the contrary qualities <lb/>
            for contrary conduct; fortune, for the same charge is not <lb/>
            equally credible in reference to a rich and a poor man, in <lb/>
            reference to one who is surrounded with relations, friends, and <lb/>
            clients, and one who is destitute of all such support; condition, <lb/>
            for it makes a great difference whether a man is illustnous or <lb/>
            obscure, a magistrate or a private person, a father or a son, a <lb/>
            citizen or a foreigner, free or a slave, married or a bachelor, <lb/>
            the father of children or childless ; 27. natural disposition, for <lb/>
            avarice, passionateness, sensibility, cruelty, austerity, and other <lb/>
            similar affections of the mind, frequently either cause credit <lb/>
            to be given to an accusation or to be withheld from it; manner <lb/>
            of living, for it is often a matter of inquiry whether a person <lb/>
            is luxurious, or parsimonious, or mean; occupations, for a <lb/>
            countryman, a lawyer, a trader, a soldier, a mariner, a phy­ <lb/>
            sician, act in very different ways. 28. We must consider also <lb/>
            what a person affects, whether he would wish to appear rich <lb/>
            or eloquent, just or powerful. Previous doings and sayings, <lb/>
            too, are to be taken into account; for the present is com­ <lb/>
            monly estimated from the past. To these some add commotion <lb/>
            of the mind, which they wish to be understood in the sense uf <lb/>
            a temporary excitement of the feelings, as anger, or fear; <lb/>
            29. and designs, which respect the present, past, and future, <lb/>
            but these, though they are accidents of persons, should yet be <note type="footnote">z a </note> <pb n="340"/>

            referred, I think, as considered in themselves, to that spe­ <lb/>
            cies of argument which we derive from motives ; as also cer­ <lb/>
            tain dispositions of mind, in regard to which it is considered <lb/>
            whether a particular person is a friend or an enemy of another <lb/>
            person. 30. They specify also the name among the topics of <lb/>
            argument in regard to a person; and the name must certainly <lb/>
            be termed an accident of a person, but it is rarely the founda­ <lb/>
            tion of any reasoning, unless when it has been given for some <lb/>
            cause, as Sapiens, Magnus, Plenus,* or has suggested some <lb/>
            thought to the bearer of it, as Lentulus's † name led him to think <lb/>
            of joining the conspiracy of Catiline, because dominion was said <lb/>
            to be promised by the Sibylline books and the predictions of <lb/>
            the soothsayers to three Cornelii, and he believed himself, as <lb/>
            he was a Cornelius, to be the third after Sylla and Cinna. 31. <lb/>
            As to the conceit of Euripides,‡ where the brother of Poly­ <lb/>
            nices reflects on his name, as an argument of his disposition, <lb/>
            it is extremely poor. For jesting, however, occasion is fre­ <lb/>
            quently furnished by a name, § and Cicero has more than once <lb/>
            indulged in it in his pleadings against Verres. Such, and of <lb/>
            such a nature, are the common subjects of argument with re­ <lb/>
            gard to persons. All I cannot enumerate, either under this <lb/>
            head or under others, but content myself with showing the way <lb/>
            to those who may inquire farther.</p>
          <p>32. I now come to things, among which actions are most <lb/>
            closely connected with persons, and must therefore be first <lb/>
            considered. In regard, then, to everything that is done, the <lb/>
            question is, either why, or where, or when, or in what manner, or <lb/>
            by what means, it was done, 33. Arguments are consequently <lb/>
            derived from the motives for actions done or to be done ; the <lb/>
            matter of which motives, which some of the Greek writers call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὓλη</foreign> <lb/>
            and others <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύναμις</foreign>, they divide into two kinds, subdividing each' <lb/>
            kind into four species ; for the motive for any action is gene <lb/>

            servation, or the enjoyment, of some good, or the avoidance, <lb/>
            diminution, endurance, of some evil, or delivery from it; con­ <lb/>
            siderations which have great weight in all our deliberations. <lb/>
            34. But right actions have such motives ; wrong on!!!!. on the <lb/>
            contrary, proceed from false notions; for the origin of them is <lb/>
            from the objects which men fancy to be good or evil ; and <lb/>
            hence arise errors of conduct, and corrupt passions, among <lb/>
            which may be reckoned anger, envy, hatred, avarice, presump­ <lb/>
            tion,* ambition audacity, timidity, and other feelings of a simi­ <lb/>
            lar nature. Sometimes fortuitous circumstances are added, as <lb/>
            drunkenness. or mistake, which sometimes serve to excuse, and <lb/>
            sometimes to give weight to a charge, as when a man is said <lb/>
            to have killed person while he was lying in wait for another. <lb/>
            35. Motives, moreover, are constantly investigated not only to <lb/>
            establish, but torepel, accusations, as when an accused person <lb/>
            maintains that he acted rightly, that is, from a laudable <lb/>
            motive; on which point I have spoken more fully in the third <lb/>
            book. † 36. Questions of definition, too, sometimes depend <lb/>
            upon motives, as whether he is a tyrannicide who killed a <lb/>
            tyrant by whom he had been caught in adultery ; and whether <lb/>
            he is guilty of sacrilege who took down arms suspended in a <lb/>
            temple to drive enemies out of his city. 37. Arguments are <lb/>
            also drawn fromplaces ; for it often concerns the proof of a <lb/>
            fact, whether the scene of it was mountainous or level, maritime <lb/>
            or inland, planted or uncultivated frequented or lonely, near or <lb/>
            distant, suitable or unsuitable for the alleged purpose; conside­ <lb/>
            rations which Cicero treats with very great effect in his de­ <lb/>
            fence of Milo. 38. These and similar points most commonly <lb/>
            relate to questions of fact, but sometimes also to questions of <lb/>
            law, as whether a place be private or public, sacred or profane, <lb/>
            our own or belonging to another, as we consider in -regard to <lb/>
            a person whether he be a magistrate, or a father, or aforeigner. <lb/>
            39. For hence questions arise ; as, You have taken the money <lb/>
            of a private individual, but. as you took it from a temple, your <lb/>
            crime is not mere theft, but sacrilege. — You have killed an i <lb/>
            adulterer, an act which the law allows, but as you committed it <lb/>
            in a brothel, it is murder. — You have done violence, but as you <lb/>
            did it to a magistrate, an action for treason may be brought <note type="footnote"> * Spet.] In a bad sense; hope of obtaining that to which we hava <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> <unclear/>[EV </note> <lb/>
            against you. 40. Or, on the other hand, a person may argue, <lb/>
            I had a right to act in such a way, for I was a father, or I was <lb/>
            a magistrate. But it is to be observed that arguments derived <lb/>
            from place afford* matter for dispute as to questions of fact <lb/>
            as well as regarding points of Jaw. Place, too, frequently <lb/>
            affects the quality of an action; for the same act is not allow­ <lb/>
            able or becoming in all places alike; and it is likewise of con­ <lb/>
            sequence before what people a question is tried; for every <lb/>
            people has its peculiar customs and laws. 41. Place has also <lb/>
            influence in commendation or disparagement; as Ajax says in <lb/>
            Ovid, † Agimus ante rates causam, et mecum confertur Ulysses ? <lb/>
            " Do we plead our cause before the ships, and is Ulysses com­ <lb/>
            pared with me To Milo, too, it was made a subject of re­ <lb/>
            proach, among other things, that Clodius had been killed by <lb/>
            him amidst the monuments of his ancestors. 42. Place has <lb/>
            influence, moreover, in deliberative oratory, as well as time, <lb/>
            some remarks on which I shall subjoin.</p>
          <p>Qftinge,as I have already observed in another place,‡ there <lb/>
            are two acceptations, since it is viewed either generally or <lb/>
            specially. Generally, as when we say, now, formerly, in the <lb/>
            time of Alexander, during the struggle at the siege of Troy; <lb/>
            or whatever relates to the present, past, or future. Specially, <lb/>
            when we speak of received divisions of time, as in the summer, <lb/>
            in the winter, by day, by night, or of accidental occurrences at <lb/>
            any particular period, as during a pestilence, in a war, at a <lb/>
            banquet. 43. Some of our Latin authors have thought that <lb/>
            sufficient distinction was made if they called time in general <lb/>
            merely time, and special portions of it times. To say nothing <lb/>
            more on that point, regard to time in both senses is to be had <lb/>
            both in deliberative and epideictic, but most frequently in <lb/>
            judicial, pleading. 44. For it gives rise to questions of law, § <lb/>
            and determines the quality of actions, and has great influence <note type="footnote"> * Sed circa facti controversiam argumenta præstant, circa juris lites <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH.X.] </note> <lb/>
            in questions of fact, since it sometimes offers irrefragable <lb/>
            proofs, as if a person should be said (as I supposed above *) to <lb/>
            have signed a deed when he died before the date of it, or to <lb/>
            have done something wrong when he was quite an infant or <lb/>
            even not born. 45. Besides it is to be observed that argu­ <lb/>
            ments of all kinds are readily drawn either from circumstances <lb/>
            that preceded the fact in question, or occurred at the same time <lb/>
            with it, or happened after it: From previous circumstances, <lb/>
            as, You threatened the deceased with death, you went out at night, <lb/>
            you went before AiM on the road ; and motives for deeds, too, <lb/>
            relate to time past: 46. From contemporaneous circumstances, <lb/>
            which some have distinguished more nicely than was necessary, <lb/>
            dividing them into that which is combined with an act, as, <lb/>
            A noise was heard, and that which is attached to an act, as <lb/>
            A cry was raised: From subsequent circumstances, as, You <lb/>
            concealed yourself; you fled; discolorations and swellings <lb/>
            appeared on the body.. The defendant also will direct his <lb/>
            thoughts to the same divisions of time in order to discredit <lb/>
            the charge that is brought against him.</p>
          <p>47. In these considerations is included all that concerns <lb/>
            deeds and words ; but under two aspects; for some things are <lb/>
            done because something else will follow; and others Because <lb/>
            something else was done before ; as when it is alleged against a <lb/>
            man accused of trafficking in women, that he bought a beautiful <lb/>
            woman who had been found guilty of adultery ;f or against a <lb/>
            rake accused of parricide that he had said to his father, You <lb/>
            shall not reproach me any more; for the former is not a traf­ <lb/>
            ficker in women because he bought the woman, but he <lb/>
            bought her because he was a trafficker in women; and <lb/>
            the latter did not kill his father because he uttered those words, <lb/>
            but uttered the words because he meditated killing his father.</p>
          <p>48. As to fortuitous occurrences, which also afford ground <lb/>
            for arguments, they doubtless belong to subsequent time, but <lb/>
            are generally distinguished by some peculiarity in the persons <lb/>
            whom they concern; as if I should say, Scipio was a better <lb/>
            general than Hannibal; he defeated Hannibal.—He was a <lb/>
            good pilot; he never suffered shipwreck.—He was a good husband­ <note type="footnote">* C. 5, sect. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t I hesitate at this example, says Spalding, as there is nothing <lb/>
            bearing on any such case in the Roman law; but I must suppose it, <lb/>
            he adds, to have been a theme for declamation in the schools. No <lb/>
            other commentator makes any remark about it </note> <pb n="344"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.V. </note> <lb/>
            man; he raised large crops. Or, in reference to bad qualities, <lb/>
            He was extravagant; he exhausted his patrimony.—He lived <lb/>
            disgracefully; he was disliked by all.</p>
          <p>49. We must also, especially in questions of fact, regard <lb/>
            the means of which a party was possessed; for probability <lb/>
            inclines usto suppose that a smaller number was killed by a <lb/>
            larger, a weaker by a stronger, people asleep by people awake, <lb/>
            the unsuspecting by the well prepared. Opposite states of <lb/>
            things lead to opposite conclusions. 50. Such points we re­ <lb/>
            gard in deliberative speeches; and in judicial pleadings we <lb/>
            keep them in view with reference to two considerations, <lb/>
            whether a person had the inclination, and whether he had the <lb/>
            power; for hope depending on power, often gives rise to incli­ <lb/>
            ,-Power; Hence that conjecture in Cicero :* “Clodius lay in <lb/>
            wait for Milo, not Milo for Clodius ; Clodius was attended with <lb/>
            a body of stout slaves, Milo with a party of women; Clodius <lb/>
            was travelling on horseback, Milo in a carriage; Clodius was <lb/>
            unincumbered, Milo enveloped in a cloak." 51. Under <lb/>
            means, also, we may include instruments, for they form part of <lb/>
            appliances and resources; and presumptive proofs, too, some­ <lb/>
            times arise from instruments, as when a sharp weapon is <lb/>
            found sticking in a dead body. 52. To all this is to be added <lb/>
            manner, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόπος</foreign>, in reference to which <lb/>
            the question is, How a thing was done? And it has relation <lb/>
            both to the quality of an act and to the interpretation of <lb/>
            writings, † as if we should deny that it is lawful to kill an <lb/>
            adulterer with poison, and say that he ought to have been killed <lb/>
            with a sword. ‡ It may concern questions of fact also ; as if I <lb/>
            should say that a thing was done with a good intention, and <lb/>
            therefore, openly ; or-with a bad intention, and therefore insidi­ <lb/>
            ously, in the night, and in a lonely place.</p>
          <p>53. But in regard to every matter, about the quality or <lb/>
            nature of which there is any question, and which we contem­ <lb/>
            plate independently of persons and all else that constitutes a <lb/>
            cause, three points are doubtless to be considered, whether it <lb/>
            is, what iLis, and of what nature it is. But as certain topics <lb/>
            of argument are common to all these, the three cannot be <note type="footnote"> * Pro Mil. c. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> t See sect. 40 of this chapter, and iii. 5, 4; iiL 6, 55, 66. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See sect. 88, and iii. 6, 27. </note> <pb n="345"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.X.] </note> <lb/>
            divided, and must accordingly be introduced under the heads <lb/>
            under which they respectively happen to fall.</p>
          <p>54. Arguments, then, are drawn from definition, (ex fini­ <lb/>
            tione seu fine, for both terms are in use,) of which there are <lb/>
            two modes; for we either inquire simply whether such a thing <lb/>
            is a virtue, or with a definition previously given, what virtue <lb/>
            IS! Such definition we either express in a general way, as, <lb/>
            Rhetoric is the art of speaking well, or with an enumeration <lb/>
            of particulars, as Rhetoric is the art of rightly conceiving, <lb/>
            arranging, and expressing our thoughts, with an unfailing <lb/>
            memory and with propriety of action. 55. We also define a <lb/>
            thing either by its nature, as in the preceding example, or by <lb/>
            reference to etymology, as when we derive the sense of assiduus <lb/>
            from as and do, that of locuples from copia locorum, or that of <lb/>
            pecuniosus from copiapecorum.</p>
          <p>To definitions seem especially to belong genus, species, dif­ <lb/>
            ference, property. 56. From all these arguments are de­ <lb/>
            duced. Genus can do little to establish species, but very much <lb/>
            to set it aside; what is a tree, therefore, is not necessarily a <lb/>
            plane tree, but what is not a tree, is certainly not a plane <lb/>
            tree; nor can that which is not a virtue be justice; and there­ <lb/>
            fore we must proceed from the genus to the ultimate species;* <lb/>
            as to say, Man is an animal, is not enough, for animal is the <lb/>
            genus; and to say that he is mortal, though it expresses a <lb/>
            species, is but a definition common to other animals; but if <lb/>
            we say that he is rational, nothing will be wanting to signify <lb/>
            what we wish. 57. On the contrary, species affords a strong <lb/>
            proof of genus, but has little power to disprove it; for that <lb/>
            which is justice is certainly a virtue, while that which is not <lb/>
            justice may be a virtue, if it is fortitude, prudence, or tempe­ <lb/>
            rance. A genus, therefore, will never be disproved by proving <lb/>
            a species, unless all the species, which are included under that <lb/>
            genus, be set aside, as That which is neither mortal nor immor­ <lb/>
            tal is not an animal.</p>
          <p>58. To genus and species writers add properties and differences. <lb/>
            By properties a definition is established; by differences it is <lb/>
            overthrown. A property is that which either belongs only to one <lb/>
            object, as speech and laughter to man, or belongs to it, but not <lb/>
            to it alone, as heat is a property of fire. There may be also <lb/>
            many properties of the same thing, as fire, for instance, shines <lb/>
            as well as heats. Consequently, whatever property is omitted <note type="footnote"> * See sect. 5. Cicero Topic. c. 6. </note> <pb n="346"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V. </note> <lb/>
            in a definition, will weaken it; but it is not every property <lb/>
            introduced in it that will establish it. 59. It is very often a <lb/>
            question, too, what is a property of something under considera­ <lb/>
            tion ; for instance, if it be asserted, on the etymology of the <lb/>
            word, " It constitutes a man a tyrannicide to kill a tyrant," we <lb/>
            may deny it, for if an executioner should kill a tyrant delivered <lb/>
            to him to be put to death, he would not be called a tyrannicide, <lb/>
            nor would a man be called so that had killed a tyrant unawares <lb/>
            or unwillingly. 60. But that which is not a peculiar property <lb/>
            will be a difference ; as it is one thing to be a slave andanother <lb/>
            to serve; Whence there is this distinction with regard to addicti, <lb/>
            or insolvent debtors sentenced to serve their creditors: He <lb/>
            who is a slave, if he is set free, becomes a freedman; but this <lb/>
            is not the case with an addictus; and there are other points of <lb/>
            difference between them, of which I shall speak in another <lb/>
            place.* 61. They call that also a difference, by which, when <lb/>
            the genus is distinguished into species, a species itself is par­ <lb/>
            ticularized ; as, Animal is the genus; mortal, a species, ter­ <lb/>
            restrial or two-footed, a difference; for we have not yet come <lb/>
            to property, though the animal is distinguished from the <lb/>
            aquatic or the four-footed; but such distinction belongs, not <lb/>
            so much to argument, as to exact expression of definition. <lb/>
            62. Cicero separates genus and species, which latter he calls <lb/>
            form, from definition, and puts them Tinder relation; as, for <lb/>
            example, if a person to whom all the silver of another person <lb/>
            has been bequeathed, should claim also the coined silver, he <lb/>
            would found his claim upon genus; but if a person, when a <lb/>
            legacy has been left to a woman who should have been a mater­ <lb/>
            familias to her husband, denies that it ought to be paid to her <lb/>
            who never came into her husband's power, he reasons from <lb/>
            species, because there are two sorts of marriages.†</p>
          <p>63. Cicero‡ also shows that definition is assisted by division, <lb/>
            which he makes distinct from partition, partition being the dis­ <lb/>
            tribution of a whole into its parts, division that of a genus <note type="footnote"> * VII. 3, 26 ; iii. 6, 25. </note><note type="footnote"> t The two sorts of marriages were per coemptionem, when the woman <lb/>
            was delivered into the hand and power of the man, and was then called <lb/>
            materfamilias; the other was citra coemptionem, when the connexion <lb/>
            was formed by cohabitation. Turnebus. See Cic. pro Flacc. 34. Adam a <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH.X.] </note> <lb/>
            into its forms or species. The number of parts, he says, is <lb/>
            uncertain ;* for instance, the parts of which a state consists; <lb/>
            but that of forms, certain, as the number of forms of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, which we understand to be three, that in which the power <lb/>
            is in the hands of the people, that in which it is in those of a <lb/>
            few, and that in which it is in those of one. 64. He, indeed, <lb/>
            does not use these examples, because, writing to Trebatius, † he <lb/>
            preferred taking his instances from law. I have given such, <lb/>
            as I think, plainer.</p>
          <p>properties have reference also to questions dependent on <lb/>
            conjecture;‡ or, as it is the property of a good man to act <lb/>
            rightly, and of a passionate man to be violent in his language, <lb/>
            it is supposed that he who acts rightly is a good man, and that <lb/>
            he who is violent in his language is a passionate one; and <lb/>
            such as act or speak otherwise are supposed to be of opposite <lb/>
            characters ; for when certain qualities are not in certain per­ <lb/>
            sons, the inference, though from opposite premises, is of a <lb/>
            similar nature.</p>
          <p>65. Division, in a similar way, serves to prove and to refute. <lb/>
            For proof it is sometimes sufficient to establish one half; as <lb/>
            in this example: A man, to he a citizen, must either have been <lb/>
            born a citizen, or have been made one; but in refuting you <lb/>
            must overthrow both particulars, and show that he was neither <lb/>
            born nor made a citizen. 66.. This mode of reasoning is mani­ <lb/>
            fold; and there is a form of argument by successive removals,|| <lb/>
            by which a whole allegation is sometimes proved to be false, <lb/>
            and sometimes a portion of it, which is left after successive <lb/>
            removals, is shown to be true. A whole allegation is proved <lb/>
            to be false in this manner: You say that you lent this money: <lb/>
            Either then you had it of your own, or you received it from <lb/>
            some one else, or you found it, or you stole it: If you neither had <lb/>
            it of your own, nor received it from any one, nor etc., you did <note type="footnote"> * Of forms there is always a certain number, and to omit any one <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            not lend it. 67. What is left is established as true in this <lb/>
            way: This slave, whom you claim as your own, was either born <lb/>
            in your house, or bought by you, or given to you, or left to you <lb/>
            by will, or captured by you from the enemy,—or he belongs to <lb/>
            another person: when it is shown that the suppositions are all <lb/>
            unfounded, except the last, it will be clear that the slave <lb/>
            belongs to another. This kind of argumentation is dangerous, <lb/>
            and must be conducted with great wariness, for if we omit one <lb/>
            particular in the enumeration, our whole edifice will fall to <lb/>
            the ground, to the amusement of our audience. 68. That <lb/>
            mode is safer which Cicero uses in his speech for Cæcina,* <lb/>
            when he asks, If this is not the point in question, what is it? <lb/>
            for thus all other points are set aside at once. That also is <lb/>
            safer, in which two contrary propositions are advanced, of <lb/>
            which it is sufficient for our purpose to establish either ; as in <lb/>
            this example from Cicero :f There is certainly no one so un­ <lb/>
            favourable to Cluentius as not to grant me one thing: If it is <lb/>
            certain that those judges were bribed, they must have been bribed <lb/>
            either by Habitus or by Oppianicus; if I show that they were <lb/>
            not bribed by Habitus, I prove that they were bribed by Oppi­ <lb/>
            anicus; if I make it appear that they were bribed by Oppi­ <lb/>
            anicus, I clear Habitus from suspicion. 69. Or liberty may be <lb/>
            granted to our adversary to choose one of two propositions, of <lb/>
            which one must necessarily be true, and, whichsoever he <lb/>
            chooses, it may be proved to be adverse to his cause. This is <lb/>
            a mode which Cicero adopts in pleading for Oppius:: Whether <lb/>
            was it when he was aiming at Cotta, or when he was attempting <lb/>
            to kill himself, that the weapon was snatched from his hand ? <lb/>
            And in that for Varenus :§ The option is granted you, whether <lb/>
            you would prefer to say that Varenus took that road by chance, <lb/>
            or at the instigation and persuasion of the other; and he then <lb/>
            shows that either supposition is equally adverse to the accuser. <lb/>
            70. Sometimes two propositions are stated of such a nature, <lb/>
            that from either, if adopted, thesame consequence follows: as <note type="footnote"> * C. 13. </note><note type="footnote"> t Pro Cluent. c. 23. </note><note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote"> ‡ Marcus Aurelius Cotta, proconsul of Bithynia, had dismissed his <lb/>

            defended by Cicero. See Dion. Cass. b. xxxvi. p. Reim. 100. The <lb/>

            in the common adage, We must philosophize, though we must <lb/>
            not philosophize ;* or in the still more common question, To <lb/>
            what purpose is a figure,† if the subject is intelligible ? to what <lb/>
            purpose if it is not intelligible ? and in this saying, He who can <lb/>

            pain will tell lies.</p>
          <p>71. As there are three parts of time, so the order of things <lb/>
            is comprised in three stages of progress; for everything has a <lb/>
            beginning, an increase, and a completion; as first, for instance, <lb/>
            there is a quarrel, then one man’s blood is shed, then that of <lb/>
            several. Here then is an origin for arguments supporting <lb/>
            one another; for the end may be inferred from the beginning; <lb/>
            as in the common saying, I cannot expect a toga prætexta when <lb/>
            I see the commencement of the web black; or the beginning <lb/>
            may be argued from the end; as the resignation of the dictator­ <lb/>
            ship may be made an argument that Sylla did not take arms <lb/>
            with the object of making himself a tyrant. 72. From the in­ <lb/>
            crease of a thing, in like manner, arguments may be drawn <lb/>
            with regard both to its beginning and its end; and that not <lb/>
            only in conjectures as to matters of fact, but in the considera­ <lb/>
            tion of points of law : as, Is the end referable to the beginning? <lb/>

            the quarrel began ?</p>
          <p>73. Arguments are also drawn from similarities: If conti­ <lb/>
            nence be a virtue, abstinence is also a virtue; If a guardian <lb/>
            ought to give security, so likewise should an agent. This argu­ <lb/>
            ment is of the nature of that which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπαγωγτ́</foreign>. <lb/>
            Cicero‡ induction. From dissimilarities: If joy is a good, <lb/>
            pleasure is not therefore necessarily a good: What is law­ <lb/>
            ful in regard to a woman, is not also lawful in regard to a <lb/>
            minor. § From contrarieties: Frugality is a good, for extrava­ <note type="footnote"> * That is, says Turnebus, we must give some attention to philo­ <lb/>

            vice unawares. 74. From contradictions: He who is wise, is <lb/>
            not a fool. From consequences or adjuncts : If justice is a <lb/>
            goody we ought to judge with justice : If deceit is an evil, we <lb/>
            must not deceive; and such propositions may be reversed. <lb/>
            Nor are the arguments that follow dissimilar to these; so that <lb/>
            they may properly be ranged under the same head, to which, <lb/>
            indeed, they naturally belong: What a man never had he has <lb/>
            not lost: A person whom we love we shall not knowingly injure: <lb/>
            For a person whom a man has resolved to make his heir, he has <lb/>
            had, has, and will have,. affection. But as such arguments are <lb/>
            incontrovertible, they partake of the nature of necessary india <lb/>
            cations.t 75. The latter sort, however, I call arguments from <lb/>
            what is consequent, or what the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀϰόλουθον</foreign>, as good­ <lb/>
            ness is consequent upon wisdom; (what merely follows, that is, <lb/>
            happens afterwards, or will be, I would distinguish by the <lb/>
            Greek term <foreign xml:lang="grc">παεπόμενον</foreign>.) But about names I am not anxious; <lb/>
            every one may use what terms he pleases, provided that the <lb/>
            character of the things themselves be understood, and that <lb/>
            the one be regarded as dependent on time, and the other on <lb/>
            the nature of things. 76. Accordingly, I do not hesitate to <lb/>
            call‡ the following forms of argument consequential, (though <lb/>
            from what precedes in order of time they give an indication of <lb/>
            what is to follow in order of time,) of which some have sought <lb/>
            to make two kinds: the first regarding action, as exemplified <lb/>
            in Cicero's speech for Oppius :§ Those whom he could not lead <lb/>
            forth into the province against their will, how could he detain <lb/>
            against their will ? the other regarding time, as shown in this <lb/>
            passage against Verres :ll If the Kalends of January put an <lb/>
            end to the authority of the prœtor’s edict, why does not the com­ <note type="footnote"> trustee; but what you owe to a minor you cannot pay in the same <lb/>

            mencement of its authority bear date from the Kalends of <lb/>

            if you reverse the propositions they lead to an opposite conclu­ <lb/>
            sion ; for it is also a necessary consequence that they who could <lb/>
            not have been retained against their will, could not have been <lb/>
            led forth against their will..</p>
          <p>78. Those arguments, too, which are drawn from particu <lb/>
            Jars that mutually support each other, and which some <lb/>
            rhetoricians wish to be deemed of a peculiar kind, (they call <lb/>
            them <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϰ τω̃ν πὸς ἄλληλα</foreign>, † Cicero ‡ terms them ex rebus sub <lb/>
            tandem rationem venientibus,) I would rank with those of <lb/>
            necessary consequence; as, If it is honourable for the Rhodians <lb/>
            to let their customs, it is also honourable in Hermocreon to farm <lb/>
            them; and, what it is proper to learn, it is also proper to teach. I <lb/>
            79. Of which nature is the happy saying of Domitius Afer, <lb/>
            not expressed in this manner, but having a similar effect: I <lb/>
            accused, you condemned.§ There is also a kind of argument <lb/>
            from two propositions relatively consequent, and which proves <lb/>
            the same thing from opposite statements; as, He who says <lb/>
            that the world was produced, says also that it will come to an <lb/>
            end; for everything which is produced comes to an end. 80. <lb/>
            Similar to this is the kind of argument by which that which <lb/>
            is done is inferred from that which does, or the contrary; <lb/>
            which rhetoricians call an argument from causes. Sometimes <lb/>
            the consquence necessarily happens, sometimes generally, though <lb/>
            not necessarily. Thus a Body, for example, casts a shadow in <lb/>
            the light, and, wherever there is a shadow, it necessarily proves <lb/>
            that there is a body. 81. Sometimes, as I said, the conse­ <lb/>
            quence is not necessary, whether with reference to the cause <lb/>
            and the effect together, or to the cause or effect severally. <lb/>
            Thus, The sun darkens the skin; but it does not necessarily <lb/>
            follow that he whose skin is dark has been darkened by the sun. <lb/>
            A road makes a man dusty: but it is not every road that <note type="footnote"> • The text has, Consequens enim est eos, qui inviti duci non potuerint, <lb/>
            invitos non potuisse retineri, but it is justly observed by Gesner that <lb/>
            the infinitives ought to change places. He thinks that the mistake <lb/>
            may have been Quintilian's own. </note><note type="footnote"> t Aristot. Rhet. ii. 23, 3. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ De Inv. i 20. </note><note type="footnote"> § There is a similar expression, as the critics have observed, in Ovid <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[B.V. </note> <lb/>
            throws up dust; nor does it follow that every man who is dusty <lb/>
            has been on a road. 82. Arguments of necessary consequence <lb/>
            both from cause and effect. are such as these: If it is wisdom <lb/>
            that makes a man good, a good man is necessarily wise; and <lb/>
            so, It is the part of a good man to act uprightly, of a bad man <lb/>
            to act dishonourably; and accordingly those who act uprightly <lb/>
            are considered good, and those who act dishonourably, bad; and <lb/>
            this is a just conclusion. But if we say that exercise generally <lb/>
            makes the body strong, it will not follow that whoever is strong, <lb/>
            has taken exercise, or that whoever has taken exercise, is strong; <lb/>
            nor, because fortitude secures us from fearing death, will it <lb/>
            follow that whoever does not fear death is to be thought a man <lb/>
            of fortitude; nor if the sun gives men the head-ache, does it <lb/>
            follow that the suit is not useful to mein. 83. The following <lb/>
            kind of argument belongs chiefly to the suasory department of <lb/>
            oratory: Virtue confers glory, therefore it is to be folowed ; <lb/>
            pleasure brings infamy, therefore it is to be avoided. J</p>
          <p>84. But we are judiciously admonished by writers on <lb/>
            oratory that causes are not to be sought too far back; as <lb/>
            Medea, for example, says in the play,t “ Would that never in <lb/>
            the grove of Pelion," as if "the felling of a fir-tree to the <lb/>
            earth" there had had the effect of producing her misery or <lb/>
            guilt; or as Philoctetes says to Paris,‡ " If you had controlled <lb/>
            your passion, I should not now be miserable;" for, retracing <lb/>
            causes in this way, we may arrive at any point whatever.</p>
          <p>85. To these I should think it ridiculous to add what they <lb/>
            call the conjugate argument, had not Cicero § introduced it. <lb/>
            An example of it is, That they who do a just thing do justly, <lb/>
            which certainly needs no proof, any more than Quod compas­ <lb/>
            cuum est, compascere licere, " On a common pasture it is com­ <lb/>
            mon to every man to send his cattle to feed. ”</p>
          <p>86. Some call those arguments, which I have specified as <lb/>
            drawn from causes or efficients, by another name,. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϰάσεις</foreign>, <note type="footnote">* Spalding's text has quœ utique fiunt, and he interprets utique by <lb/>
            necessario, but he inclines to favour utrique, which occurs in three <lb/>

            that is, issues, for nothing is indeed considered in them but <lb/>

          <p>Arguments called apposite or comparative are such as prove <lb/>
            the greater from the less, the less from the greater, or equals <lb/>
            from equals. 87. A conjecture about a fact is supported by <lb/>
            arguing from something greater: as, If a man commits sacri­ <lb/>
            lege, he will also commit an ordinary theft; from something <lb/>
            less, as, He who readily and boldly tells a lie, will commit <lb/>
            perjury; from something equal, as, He who has taken a bribe <lb/>
            to pronounce unjust judgment, will also take a bribe to bear <lb/>
            false witness. 88. A question about a point of law is supported <lb/>
            in a similar way: from something greater, as, If it is laufui <lb/>
            to kill an adulterer, it is also lawful to scourge him ; from some <lb/>
            thing less, as, If it is lawful to kill a thief in the night, how I <lb/>
            much more is it lawful to kill an armed robber? from some-. <lb/>
            thing equal, as, The punishment which is justly pronounced on <lb/>
            him who has killed his father, is also justly pronounced on him <lb/>
            who has killed his mother. All these arguments find a place <lb/>
            in causes in which we proceed by syllogism.✱</p>
          <p>89. The following forms are more suitable for questions <lb/>
            dependent on definition or quality :f If strength is good for <lb/>
            bodies, health is not less so :t If theft is a crime, much more <lb/>
            is sacrilege : If abstinence is a virtue, so is continence: If the <lb/>
            world is ruled by a providence, a state must be directed by a <lb/>
            government: If a house cannot be built without a plan, what <lb/>
            are we to think of the conduct of a fleet or an army ? 90. To <lb/>
            me it would be sufficient to notice this form merely as a genus, <lb/>
            but it is divided by others into species; for arguments arc <lb/>
            deduced by them from several things to one, and from one to <lb/>
            several, (as in the common remark, What happens once, may <lb/>
            happen often,) from a part to the whole, from genus to species, <lb/>
            from that which contains to that which is contained, from the <lb/>
            more difficult to the more easy, from the more remote to the <note type="footnote"> * III. 6, 15. </note><note type="footnote"> t See b. in. c. 6. </note><note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote"><unclear/> 4 All the commentators have passed this sentence in silence, except <lb/>
            Spalding, who is staggered at the comparison between the respective <lb/>
            values of strength and health, and proposes for sanitas to read inanitas. <lb/>
            with some suitable alteration in the other words. He says that he has <unclear/> <lb/>
            m: i with nothing similar elsewhere. I read with Gedoyn, Si robur <lb/>
            corporibus bonum est, non minus sanitas. Spalding's text has, S. r. a b. <lb/>

            nearer, and from the opposites of all these to their opposites, <lb/>
            9 1. but such arguments are all of the same nature; for they <lb/>
            are drawn from greater things and less, or from things of <lb/>
            equal force; and, if we pursue such distinctions, there will be <lb/>
            no end of particularization; for the comparison of things is <lb/>
            infinite, and, if we enumerate every kind, we must specify <lb/>
            things that are more pleasant, more agreeable, more necessary, <lb/>
            more honourable, more useful. But let me abstain from <lb/>
            speaking of more, lest I fall into that prolixity which I wish <lb/>
            to avoid. 92. As to the examples of this kind of arguments, <lb/>
            their number is incalculable; but I will notice only a very <lb/>
            few. From the greater, in Cicero's speech for Cæcina :* Shall <lb/>
            that which alarms armed troops be thought to have caused no <lb/>
            alarm in a company of lawyers ? From the easier, in his <lb/>
            speech against Clodius and Curio :† Consider whether you <lb/>
            could so easily have been made prœtor, when he, to whom you <lb/>
            had given way, was not made prator ? 93. From the more <lb/>
            difficult, in his speech for Ligarius:‡ Observe, I pray you, <lb/>
            Tubero, that I, who do not hesitate to speak of my own act, <lb/>
            speak boldly of that of Ligarius ; and, in the same speech,§ <lb/>
            Has not Ligarius ground for hope, when liberty is granted me <lb/>
            to intercede with you even for another ? From the less, in his <lb/>
            bpeech for Caecina:ll Is the knowledge that there were armed <lb/>
            men a sufficient ground for you to prove that violence was com­ <lb/>
            mitted, and is the fact of having fallen into their hands insuffi­ <lb/>
            cient ? 94. To sum up the whole in a few words, then, argu­ <lb/>
            ments are drawn from persons, causes, places, time, (of which <lb/>
            we distinguished three parts, the preceding, the coincident, and <lb/>
            the subsequent,) manner, (that is, how a thing has been done,) <lb/>
            means, (under which we included instruments,) definition, genus, <lb/>

            quences, causes, effects, issues, connexion, comparison; each of <lb/>
            which is divided into several species.</p>
          <p>95. It seems necessary to be added that arguments are deduced <lb/>
            not only from acknowledged facts, but from fictions or supposi­ <lb/>
            tions, or, as the Greeks say, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόθεσιν</foreign> : and this kind of <lb/>
            arguments is found in all the same forms as the other kinds, <lb/>
            because there may be as many species of fictitious as of true <lb/>
            arguments. 96. By using fiction, I here mean advancing <lb/>
            something, which, if it were true, would either solve a ques­ <lb/>
            tion, or assist to solve it, and then showing the resemblance <lb/>
            of the point supposed to the point under consideration. That <lb/>
            young men, who have not yet left the school, may understand <lb/>
            this process the better, I will illustrate it by some examples <lb/>
            more suitable to that age. ✱ 97. The law is, that he who does <lb/>
            not maintain his parents is to be imprisoned; a man does not <lb/>
            maintain his parents, and yet pleads that he ought not to go <lb/>
            to prison; he will perhaps have recourse to supposition, if he <lb/>
            were a soldier, if he were an infant, if he were absent from home <lb/>
            on the public service.t And to oppose the option‡ of a man <lb/>
            distinguished for bravery, we might use the supposition, if he <lb/>
            ask for supreme power, or for the overthrow of temples. 98. This <lb/>
            is a form of argument of great force against the letter of a law. <lb/>
            Cicero adopts it in his defence of Cæcina: § whence you, or <lb/>
            your slaves, or your steward—if your steward alone had driven <lb/>
            me out—but if you have not even a single slave but him who <lb/>
            drove mè out —; and there are several other examples in <lb/>
            that speech. 99. But the same sort of fiction is of great use <lb/>
            in considering the quality of an act: || If Catiline, with the <lb/>
            troop of villains that he took with him, could judge of this <lb/>
            affair, he would condemn Lucius Murœna. It serves also for <lb/>
            amplification: If this had happened to you at supper over those <note type="footnote"> * That is, such as those to which they have been accustomed in the <lb/>

          <p>100. These are the common topics of proofs which we find <lb/>
            specified, and which it is hardly satisfactory to mention under <lb/>
            general heads, as a numberless multitude of arguments springs <lb/>
            from each of them, nor, on the other hand, does the nature of <lb/>
            things allow us to pursue them through all their species; a <lb/>
            task which those who have attempted have incurred the double <lb/>
            disadvantage of saying too much and of not saying all. 101. <lb/>
            Hence most students of rhetoric, when they have fallen into <lb/>
            these inexplicable labyrinths, have, as being fettered by the <lb/>
            inflexible restrictions of rules, lost all power of action, even <lb/>
            that which they ought to have from their own mind, and, <lb/>
            keeping their eyes fixed on a master, have ceased to follow the <lb/>
            guidance of nature. 102. But as it is not sufficient to know <lb/>
            that all proofs are to be drawn from persons or from things, <lb/>
            because each of these general heads branches out into an infi­ <lb/>
            nity of others, so he who shall have learned that arguments are <lb/>
            to be deduced from preceding or coincident or subsequent cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances, will not necessarily be qualified to judge what <lb/>
            arguments proper for any particular cause are to be deduced <lb/>
            from such circumstances; 103. especially as most proofs are <lb/>
            taken from what is inherent in the nature of a cause, and <lb/>
            have nothing in common with any other cause; and these <lb/>
            proofs, while they are the strongest, are also the least obvious, <lb/>
            because, though we learn from rules what is common to all <lb/>
            causes, what is peculiar to any particular cause we have to dis­ <lb/>
            cover for ourselves. 104. This kind of arguments we may <lb/>
            well call arguments from mstances, (as we cannot other­ <lb/>
            wise express the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πείστασιζ</foreign>,) or from those things <lb/>
            which are proper to any individual cause. Thus in the case <lb/>
            of the priest guilty of adultery,‡ who, by virtue of the law by <lb/>
            which he had the power of saving a life, wished to save his <lb/>
            own life, the argument proper to the cause, in opposing him, <note type="footnote"> * Cic. Philipp. ii. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cic. Catilin. i. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ A case very similar to this is treated in the 284th of the Decla­ <lb/>

            priest have the power of saving one person from capital punishment: <lb/>
            let it be lawful to kill adulterers : a man surprises a priest in the com­ <lb/>
            mission of adultery, and, putting him to death, though he claimed his <lb/>
            life on the ground of the law, is accused of murder." Spalding. </note> <pb n="357"/>

            released, it will not be lawful to kill the adulteress ;* for this <lb/>
            argument the law supplies, which prohibits killing the adul­ <lb/>
            teress without the adulterer. 105. Thus, too, in that contro­ <lb/>
            versy, in which the law is, that the bankers might pay the half <lb/>
            of what they owed, but demand payment of the whole of what <lb/>
            was due to them, † and one banker requires the whole of his <lb/>
            debt, from another banker, the proper argument for the <lb/>
            creditor, from the nature of the cause, is, “ that it was expressly <lb/>
            inserted in the law that a banker might demand the whole <lb/>
            of a debt, for with regard to other people, there was no need <lb/>
            of a law, as every one bad the right of exacting a debt <lb/>
            in full except from a banker."‡ 106. But many new consi <lb/>
            derations present themselves in every kind of subject, and <lb/>
            especially in those cases which depend upon writing, because <lb/>
            there is often ambiguity, not only in single words, but, still <lb/>
            more, in words taken together. 107. These points for consi­ <lb/>
            deration must necessarily vary, from the complication of laws <lb/>
            and other written documents produced to support or overthrow <lb/>
            them, as one fact brings to light another, and one point of law <lb/>
            leads to the consideration of another: as, I owed you no <lb/>
            money ; why ? you never summoned me for a debt; you took no <lb/>
            interest from me; you event borrowed money from me yourself. <lb/>
            A law says, A son who does not defend his father when accused <lb/>
            of treason is to be disinherited; a son denies that he is amena­ <lb/>
            ble to this law unless his father be acquitted; and what is his <lb/>
            proof? Another law, which says that he who is found guilty <lb/>
            of treason is to be sent into exile with his defender. 108. Cicero, <lb/>
            in his speech for Cluentius, says that Publius Popilius and <lb/>
            Tiberius Gutta were found guilty, not of having bribed the <lb/>
            judges, but of having tried to bribe them. What is the proof ? <note type="footnote"> * As it is said in the declamation just mentioned : Quid quod ille <lb/>

          <p>109. But no less care ought to be taken as to what you <lb/>
            advance, than as to the manner in which what you advance is <lb/>
            to be proved. Here the power of invention, if not the great­ <lb/>
            est, is certainly the firstrequisite ; for as arrows are useless to <lb/>
            him who knows not at what he should aim, so arguments <lb/>
            are useless to him who has not ascertained to what point they <lb/>
            are to be applied. 110. This is what cannot be attained by <lb/>
            art; and accordingly, though several orators, after having stu­ <lb/>
            died the same rules, will doubtless use arguments of a similar <lb/>
            kind, yet some will devise more arguments for their purpose <lb/>
            than others. Let the following cause, which involves questions <lb/>
            by no means common with other causes, be given as an exam­ <lb/>
            ple. 111. When Alexander had demolished Thebes, he found <lb/>
            a document in which it was stated that the Thebans had lent the <lb/>
            Thessalians a hundred talents. Of this document Alexander <lb/>
            made a present to the Thessalians, as he had had their assistance <lb/>
            in the siege. But subsequently, when the Thebans were re-estab­ <lb/>
            lished by Cassander, they demanded payment of the money from <lb/>
            the Thessalians. The cause was pleaded before the Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyons. It was admitted that the Thebans had lent a hundred <lb/>
            talents, and had not been repaid. 112. The whole contro­ <lb/>
            versy depends on this point, that Alexander is said to have <lb/>
            made the present to the Thessalians. But it is admitted also <lb/>
            that no money was given by Alexander to the Thessalians ; <lb/>
            and it is therefore a question whether that which was given was <lb/>
            the same as if he had given them money. 113. Of what profit, <lb/>
            then, will grounds of argument be, unless I first settle that the <lb/>
            gift of Alexander was of no avail, that he could not give, and <lb/>
            that he did not give. The commencement of the pleading on <lb/>
            the part of the Thebans is at once easy and such as to conci­ <lb/>
            liate favour, as they seek to recover as their right that which <lb/>
            was taken from them by force; but then a sharp and vehe­ <lb/>
            ment dispute arises about the rights of war, the Thessalians <lb/>
            alleging that upon those rights depend kingdoms and people, <lb/>
            and the boundaries of nations and cities. 114. We have <note type="footnote"> * Whoever was convicted under any Jaw, might, if he proved <lb/>
            another person guilty under the same law, be reinstated in his former <lb/>
            condition. Turnebus. See Dig. xlviii. 14. </note> <pb n="359"/>

            therefore to discover, on the other side, how this cause differs <lb/>
            from causes concerning other things that fall into the hands of <lb/>
            a conqueror; and the difficulty in this respect lies not so much <lb/>
            in the proof as in the proposition to be advanced. We may <lb/>
            state in the first place, that, in regard to whatever can be brought <lb/>
            before a court of justice the right of war can have no power; that <lb/>
            things taken away by arms cannot be retained except by arms; <lb/>
            that, consequently, where arms prevail, the judge has no power, <lb/>
            and that when the judge has power, arms have none. 115. <lb/>
            Such a statement is first to be made, that an argument, such <lb/>
            for example as the following, may be brought to support it: <lb/>
            That prisoners of war, if they effect a return into their country, <lb/>
            are at once free, because what is taken by force of arms cannot <lb/>
            be held except by force of arms. It is peculiar to the cause, also, <lb/>
            that the Amphictyons are the judges in it. (For, concerning <lb/>
            the same question, there is one mode of proceeding before the <lb/>
            centumviri and another before a private judge.*)</p>
          <p>116. On the second head, we may allege that the right † <lb/>
            to the money could not have been given by Alexander to the <lb/>
            Thessalians, as right can belong only to him who holds it, and, <lb/>
            being incorporeal, cannot be grasped in the hand. This is a pro­ <lb/>
            position more difficult to conceive, than it is, when you have <lb/>
            conceived it, to support it with arguments ; such, for example, <lb/>
            as the following: that the condition of an inheritor is different <lb/>
            from that of a conqueror, because right passes to the one, and the <lb/>
            mere property to the other. 117. It is also an argument pecu­ <lb/>
            liar to the cause itself that the right over what was owing to a <lb/>
            whole people could not have passed into the hands of the con­ <lb/>
            queror, because what a whole people had lent, was due to them <lb/>
            all, and as long as a single one of them survived, he was a <lb/>
            creditor for the whole sum; and that all the Thebans had not <lb/>
            fallen into the power of Alexander. 118. This argument, such <note type="footnote"> *Privatum judicem.] Take care not to take judex privatus in the <lb/>
            sense of judex causæ privatos. For the centumviri themselves were <lb/>
            judges only of private causes. But “privati judices were such as were <lb/>
            appointed on arbitrations, and on many kinds of trials, by the prætor, <lb/>
            being themselves almost all private individuals, and accustomed to <lb/>
            have the assistance of lawyers in their proceedings, as Aquilius assisted <lb/>
            in the cause of Quinctius in Cicero ; and it is probable that there was <lb/>
            no settled body or order of men from whom such judges were chosen.<unclear>6</unclear> <lb/>

            is its force, is not upheld by external support, but sustains <lb/>
            itself by itself.</p>
          <p>On the third head the commencement of the argumentation <lb/>
            will rest on the more obvious assertion that the right did not <lb/>
            lie in the writing * a proposition which may be supported by <lb/>
            many confirmations. The intention of Alexander may also be <lb/>
            brought into question, and it may be inquired whether he meant <lb/>
            to oblige or to deceive the Thessalians. It is likewise an argu­ <lb/>
            ment peculiar to the cause, and the commencement, as it were, <lb/>
            of a new discussion, that the Thebans, even though it be ad­ <lb/>
            mitted that they lost their right, must be thought to have recovered <lb/>
            it by their re-establishment. Under this head may be inquired, <lb/>
            too, what were the views of Cassander? But all pleading <lb/>
            on behalf of equity had the highest influence wlth the <lb/>
            Amphictyons.</p>
          <p>119. I make these observations, not because I think that <lb/>
            the knowledge of the general topics from which arguments are <lb/>
            drawn is useless, (for if I had thought so, I should have given <lb/>
            no precepts respecting them,) but that those who have studied <lb/>
            them, may not think themselves, while they neglect other <lb/>
            points, complete and consummate masters of their art : and <lb/>
            may understand, that unless they acquire other accomplish­ <lb/>
            ments, on which I shall soon give instructions, they will have <lb/>
            attained but dumb knowledge. 120. For the power of finding <lb/>
            arguments was not a result of the publication of books on <lb/>
            rhetoric; all kinds of arguments were conceived before any <lb/>
            instruction was given respecting them; and writers after­ <lb/>
            wards published the forms of them when they were observed <lb/>
            and collected. It is a proof of this fact, that writers on rhetoric <lb/>
            use old examples of argumentation, extracting them from the <lb/>
            orators, and producing nothing new of their own, or anything <lb/>
            that has not been said before. 121. The real authors of the <lb/>
            art, therefore, are the orators; though certainly some thanks <lb/>
            are due to those by whom our labour has been diminished; <lb/>
            for the arguments which preceding orators have discovered, <note type="footnote"> * The advocate of the Thebans will say that the right of the <lb/>
            Thebans does not properly lie or consist in the writing, as right is <lb/>
            incorporeal, and cannot be taken in the hand ; and that, accordingly, <lb/>
            though Alexander gave the Thessalians the document by which it <lb/>
            appeared that they had borrowed a hundred talents from the Thebans, <lb/>
            it did not follow that the Thessalians were thus freed from the obliga­ <lb/>

            one after another, by the aid of their natural genius, it is not <lb/>
            necessary for us to seek, and yet they are all accurately known <lb/>
            to us. But this is not sufficient to make an orator, any more <lb/>
            than to have studied in the palæstra is sufficient to make an <lb/>
            athlete, unless the body be also strengthened by exercise, con­ <lb/>
            tinence, food, and, above all, by constitutional vigour; while, on <lb/>
            the other hand, all these advantages are of no avail without the <lb/>
            assistance of art.</p>
          <p>122. Let students of eloquence consider also, that every <lb/>
            point to which I have called their attention is not to be found <lb/>
            in every cause; and that, when a subject for discussion is <lb/>
            brought before them, they need not search for every topic of <lb/>
            argument, and knock as it were, at its door, to know whether <lb/>
            it will answer, and serve to prove what they desire ; they need <lb/>
            not do this, I say, unless while they are still learners, and <lb/>
            destitute of experience. 123. Such examination, indeed, <lb/>
            would render the process of speaking infinitely slow, if it were <lb/>
            always necessary to examine the several kinds of arguments, <lb/>
            and ascertain, by trial, which of them is fit and proper for our <lb/>
            purpose; and I know not whether all rules for argument <lb/>
            would not be a hindrance to us, unless a certain penetration of <lb/>
            mind, engendered in us by nature and exercised by study, <lb/>
            conducted us straight to all the considerations suited to any <lb/>
            particular cause. 124. For, as the accompaniment of a stringed <lb/>
            instrument, when joined to the notes of the voice, is a great <lb/>
            assistance to it, yet, if the hand of the player be slow, and <lb/>
            hesitates to which string each note of the voice corresponds, <lb/>
            until every string has been sounded and examined, it would be <lb/>
            better for the singer to be content with what his unassisted <lb/>
            power of voice enables him to accomplish. Thus, too, our <lb/>
            system of study ought to be fitted and applied, as it were, after <lb/>
            the manner of a stringed instrument, to rules of this nature; <lb/>
            125. but such an effect is not to be produced without great <lb/>
            -practice, in order that, as the hand of the musician, though he <lb/>
            be attending to something else, is yet led by habit to produce <lb/>
            grave, acute, or intermediate notes, so the variety and number <lb/>
            of arguments in a case may not embarrass the judgment of the <lb/>
            orator, but may present and offer themselves to his aid; and <lb/>
            that, as letters and syllables require no meditation on the part <lb/>
            of the writer, so reasons may follow the orator as of their own <lb/>
            accord. <pb n="362"/>

            they apply to all kinds of comparison of like with like, and <lb/>
            especially to examples that rest on the authority of history. <lb/>
            Our rhetoricians, for the most part, have preferred to give the <lb/>
            name of comparison to that which the Greek calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">πααολή</foreign>, <lb/>
            and to render <foreign xml:lang="grc">παάάδειγμα</foreign> by example. Example however par­ <lb/>
            takes of comparison, and comparison of example. 2. For <lb/>
            myself, that I may the better explain my object, let me include <lb/>
            both under the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">παάδειγμα</foreign> , and translate it by example. <lb/>
            Nor do I fear that in this respect I may be thought at variance <lb/>
            with Cicero,. though he distinguishes comparison from example; <lb/>
            for he divides t all argumentation into two parts, induction‡ <lb/>
            and reasoning,§ as most of the Greeks || divide it into <foreign xml:lang="grc">παα­ <lb/>
            δείγματα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">επιχειήματα</foreign>, and call the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παάδειγμα</foreign> rhetorical <lb/>
            induction. 3. Indeed the mode of argument which Socrates <unclear/> <lb/>
            chielly used was of this nature; for when he had asked a <lb/>
            number of questions, to which his adversary was obliged to <lb/>
            reply in the affirmative, he at last inferred the point about <lb/>
            which the question was raised, and to which his antagonist <lb/>
            had already admitted something similar; this method was <lb/>
            induction. This cannot be done in a regular speech ; but what <lb/>
            is asked in conversation is assumed in a speech. 4. Suppose <lb/>
            that a question of this kind be put: What is the most noble <lb/>
            fruit ? Is it not that which is the best ? This will at once be <lb/>
            granted. And which is the most noble horse ? Is it not thai <note type="footnote"> * De Inv. i. 30. </note><note type="footnote"> t De Inv. i. 31; compare c. 10, soct 73. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επαγωγή</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> § <foreign xml:lang="grc">Συλλογμός</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> ∥ Aristot.

            <note type="margin"> CH. XL] </note> <lb/>
            which is the best ? This, and perhaps more questions to the <lb/>
            same effect, will readily be admitted. Last of all will be <lb/>
            asked the question with a view to which the others were put. <lb/>
            And among men who is the most noble ? Is it not he who is <lb/>
            the best ? and this may also be allowed. 5. This mode of <lb/>
            interrogation is of great effect in questioning witnesses; but <lb/>
            in a continuous speech there is a difference ; for there the <lb/>
            orator replies to himself: What fruit is the most noble ? The <lb/>
            best, I should suppose. What horse ? That surely which is the <lb/>
            swiftest. And thus he is the best of men, who excels most, not <lb/>
            in nobleness of birth but in merit.</p>
          <p>All arguments, therefore, of this kind, must either be from <lb/>
            things similar, or dissimilar, or contrary. Similitudes are <lb/>
            sometimes sought, merely for the embellishment of speech; <lb/>
            but I will speak on that subject when the progress of my <lb/>
            work requires me to do so ;* at present I am to pursue what <lb/>
            relates to proof. 6. Of all descriptions of proof the most effi­ <lb/>
            cacious is that which we properly term example; that is, the <lb/>
            adducing of some historical fact, or supposed fact, intended to <lb/>
            convince the hearer of that which we desire to impress <lb/>
            upon him. We must consider, therefore, whether such-­ <lb/>
            fact is completely similar to what we wish to illustrate, <lb/>
            or only partly so; that we may either adopt the whole of it, <lb/>
            or only such portion of it as may serve our purpose. It is a <lb/>
            similitude when we say, Saturninus was justly killed, as were <lb/>
            the Gracchi. 7. A dissimilitude, when we say, Brutus put his <lb/>
            children to death for forming traitorous designs on their <lb/>
            country; Manlius punished the valour of his son with death. <lb/>
            A contrariety, when we say, Marcellus restored the -ornaments <lb/>
            of their city to the Syracusans, who were our enemies; Verres <lb/>
            took away like ornaments from our allies.<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϯ</foreign> -Proof in eulogy <lb/>
            and censure ‡ has the same three varieties. 8. In regard also <lb/>
            to matters of which we may speak as likely to happen,§ exhor­ <lb/>
            tation drawn from similar occurrences is of great effect; as if <lb/>
            a person, for example, on remarking that Dionysius requested <lb/>
            guards for his person, in order that, with the aid of their arms, <lb/>
            he might make himself tyrant, should support his remark with <note type="footnote"> * VIII 3, 72. seqq. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero in Verr iv. 55. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ That is, in the epideictic or demonstrative department of oratory. </note><note type="footnote"> Thatis, in the deliberative department of oratory. </note> <pb n="364"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V. </note> <lb/>
            the example that Pisistratus secured absolute power in the same <lb/>
            nanner.</p>
          <p>9. Bat, as some examples are wholly similar, such as the <lb/>
            last which I gave, so there are others by which an argument <lb/>
            for the less is drawn from the greater, or an argument for the <lb/>
            greater from the less. For the violation of the marriage-bed <lb/>
            cities have been destroyed ;* what punishment is proper to be <lb/>
            inflicted on an adulterer ?–Flute-players, when they have re­ <lb/>
            tired from the city,t have been publicly recalled; and how much <lb/>
            more ought eminent men of the city, who have deserved well of <lb/>
            their country, and who have withdrawn from popular odium, to <lb/>
            be brought back from exile ?‡ 10. But unequal comparisons are <lb/>
            of most effect in exhortation. Courage is more deserving of <lb/>
            admiration in a woman than in a man; and, therefore, if a <lb/>
            person is to be excited to a deed of valour, the examples of <lb/>
            Horatius and Torquatus will not have so much influence over <lb/>
            him as that of the woman by whose hand Pyrrhus was killed; <lb/>
            and, to nerve a man to die. the deaths of Cato and Scipio will <lb/>
            not be so efficient as that of Lucretia; though these are argu <lb/>
            ments from the greater to the less.</p>
          <p>11. Let me then set before my reader examples of each of <lb/>
            these kinds, extracted from Cicero; for from whom can I <lb/>
            adduce better ? An example of the similar is the following <lb/>
            from the speech for Muræna :§ For it happened to myself <lb/>
            that I stood candidate with two patricians, the one the most <lb/>
            abandoned, and the other the most virtuous and excellent of <lb/>
            mankind ; yet in dignity I was superior to Catiline and in <lb/>
            influence to Galba. 12. An argument from the greater to the <lb/>
            less if found in the speech for Milo :∥ They deny that it is <lb/>
            lawful for him, who confesses that he has killed a human being, <lb/>
            to behold the light of day; but in what city is it, I ask, that <note type="footnote"> * An allusion to the Trojan war. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t Livy, iI. 30 : “ The fluteplayers, being prohibited by the preced­ <lb/>

            these most foolish of men thus argue ? In that city assuredly, which <lb/>
            saw the first trial in it for a capital offence in the case of the <lb/>
            brave Horatius, who, though the state was not then made free, <lb/>
            was nevertheless acquitted in a public assembly of the Roman <lb/>
            people, even though he confessed that he had killed his sister <lb/>
            with his own hand. Another from the less to the greater is <lb/>
            found in the same speech :* I killed, not Spurius Mælius, <lb/>
            who, because, by lowering the price of corn, and by lavishing <lb/>
            his patrimony, he appeared to court the populace too much, in­ <lb/>
            curred the suspicion of aspiring to royalty, &amp;c., but him, (for <lb/>
            Milo would dare to avow the act when he had freed his country <lb/>
            from peril,) whose shameless licentiousness was carried even to <lb/>
            the couches of the gods, &amp;c., with the whole of the invective <lb/>
            against Clodius.</p>
          <p>13. Arguments from dissimilar things have many sources; for <lb/>
            they depend on kind, manner, time, place, and other circum­ <lb/>
            stances, by the aid of which Cicero t overthrows nearly all the <lb/>
            previous judgments that appeared to have been formed against <lb/>
            Cluentius, while, by an example of contrast, he attacks ‡ at <lb/>
            the same time the animadversion of the censors, extolling the <lb/>
            conduct of Scipio Africanus who, when censor, had allowed a <lb/>
            knight, whom he had publicly pronounced to have formally <lb/>
            committed perjury, to retain his horse,§ because no one <lb/>
            appeared to accuse him, though he himself offered to bear <lb/>
            witness to his guilt if any one thought proper to deny it. <lb/>
            These examples I do not cite in the words of Cicero only be­ <lb/>
            cause they are too long. 14. But there is a short example of <lb/>
            contrast in Virgil. || <lb/>
            At non ille, satum quo te mentiris, Achilles, <lb/>
            Talis in hoste fuit Priamo. <lb/>
            Not he, whose son thou falsely call'st thyself <lb/>

            Priam his foe.</p>

            <note type="margin"> [B.v. </note> <lb/>
            in full; as Cicero in his speech for Milo.* When a military <lb/>
            tribune, in the army of Caius Marius, and a relative of that <lb/>
            general, offered dishonourable treatment to a soldier, he was killed <lb/>
            by the soldier whom he had thus insulted; for, being a youth of <lb/>
            proper feeling, he chose rather to risk his life than to suffer dis­ <lb/>
            honour ; and that eminent commander accounted him blameless, <lb/>
            and inflicted no punishment on him. 1 6. To other instances <lb/>
            it will be sufficient to allude, as Cicero in the same speech :<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϯ</foreign> <lb/>
            For neither could Servilius Ahala, or Publius Nasica, or <lb/>
            Lucius Opimius, or the senate during my consulship, have been <lb/>
            considered otherwise than criminal, if it be unlawful for wicked <lb/>
            men to be put to death. Such examples will be introduced <lb/>
            at greater or less length, according as they are more or less <lb/>
            known, or as the interest or embellishment of the subject may <lb/>
            require.</p>
          <p>17. The same is the case with regard to examples taken <lb/>
            from fictions of the poets, except that less weight will be <lb/>
            attributed to them. How we ought to treat them, the same ex­ <lb/>
            cellent author and master of eloquence instructs us ; 18. for an <lb/>
            example of this kind also will be found in the speech already <lb/>
            cited : Learned men, therefore, judges, have not without reason <lb/>
            preserved the tradition, in fictitious narratives, that he who had <lb/>
            killed his mother for the sake of avenging his father, was ac­ <lb/>
            quitted, when the opinions of men were divided, by the voice not <lb/>
            only of a divinity, but of the divinity of Wisdom herself. 19. <lb/>
            Those moral fables, too, which, though they were not the <lb/>
            invention of Æsop,‡ (for Hesiod appears to have been the <lb/>
            original inventor of them,) are most frequently mentioned <lb/>
            under the name of Æsop, are adapted to attract the minds, <lb/>
            especially of rustic and illiterate people, who listen less suspi­ <lb/>
            ciously than others to fictions, and, charmed by the pleasure <lb/>
            which they find in them, put faith in that which delights them. <lb/>
            20. Thus, Menenius Agrippa is said to have reconciled the <lb/>
            people to the senators by that well-known fable about the <note type="footnote"> * C. 4. See also iii 11, 14. </note><note type="footnote"> + C. 3. </note><note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote"> t For observations on this point Spalding refers to Fabric. Bibl. Gr. <lb/>

            To the sick lion what the wily fox <lb/>
            Observed, &amp;c. <lb/>
            The Greeks called this kind of composition, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰνος</foreign>‡ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσωπείς <lb/>
            λόγος</foreign>, as I remarked,§ and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λιυϰός</foreign>:|| some of our writers have <lb/>
            given it the turn apologatio,¶ or “apologue,” which has not <lb/>
            been received into general use. 21. Similar to this is that <lb/>
            sort of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παοιμία</foreign>, which is, as it were, a shorter fable, and is <lb/>
            understood allegorically: as a person may say, Non nostrum <lb/>
            onus; bos clitellas : " The burden is not mine; the ox, as they <lb/>
            say, is carrying the panniers.‛**</p>
          <p>22. Next to example, comparison is greatest effect, <lb/>
            especially that which is made between things nearly equal, <lb/>
            without any mixture of metaphor: As those who have been <lb/>
            accustomed to receive money in the Campus Martins, are gene­ <lb/>
            rally most adverse to those candidates whose money they suppose <lb/>
            to be withheld, so judges of a similar disposition came to the <lb/>
            tribunal with a hostile feeling towards the defendant. 23. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΙΙααολή</foreign>, which Cicero <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϯϯ</foreign> calls comparison, frequently brings <lb/>
            things less obvious into assimilation. Nor is it only like pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings of men that are compared by this figure, (as in the <lb/>

            which we have passed, how, let me ask tou, must I, who just see <lb/>
            land after long tossing on the waves, feel affected towards him <lb/>
            by whom I see that the greatest tempests must be encountered ?) <lb/>
            but similitudes of this kind are also taken from dumb animals, <lb/>
            and even from inanimate objects.</p>
          <p>24. Since, too, the appearance of like objects is different in <lb/>
            different aspects,. I ought to admonish the learner, that that <lb/>
            species of comparison which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴϰων</foreign>, and by <lb/>
            which the very image of things or persons is represented, (as <lb/>
            Cassius <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϯ</foreign> says, for instance, Who is that making such grimaces, <lb/>
            like those of an old man with his feet wrapped in wool ?) is <lb/>
            more rare in oratory than that by which what we enforce is <lb/>
            rendered more credible; as, if you should say that the mind <lb/>
            ought to be cultivated, you would compare it with land, which, <lb/>
            if neglected, produces briars and thorns, but, when tilled, <lb/>
            supplies us with fruit: or, if you would exhort men to engage <lb/>
            in the service of the state, you would show that even bees and <lb/>
            ants, animals not only mute but extremely diminutive, labour <lb/>
            nevertheless in common. 25. Of this kind is the following <lb/>
            comparison of Cicero :‡As our bodies can make no use of their <lb/>
            several parts, the nerves, or the blood, or the limbs, without the <lb/>
            aid of a mind, so is a state powerless without laws. But as he <lb/>
            borrows this comparison from the human body in his speech <lb/>

          <p>But the appearance of similitude is apt to mislead us, and <lb/>
            judgment is accordingly to be employed in the use of it; for <lb/>
            we must not say that as a new ship is more serviceable than an <lb/>
            old one, so it is with friendship; nor that, as the woman is to <lb/>
            be commended who is liberal of her money to many, so she is to <lb/>
            be commended who is liberal of her beauty to many. The allu­ <lb/>
            sions to age and liberality have a similarity in these examples ; <lb/>
            but it is one thing to be liberal of money, and another to be <lb/>
            reckless of chastity. 27. We must therefore consider, above <lb/>
            all things, in this kind of illustration, whether what we apply <lb/>
            is a proper comparison; just as in the Socratic mode of ques­ <lb/>
            tioning, of which I spoke a little above,* we must take care <lb/>
            that we do not answer rashly; as Xenophon's wife, in the <lb/>
            Dialogues of Æschines Socraticus, makes inconsiderate replies <lb/>
            to Aspasia; 28. a passage which Cicerof translates thus: Tell <lb/>
            me, Ipray you, wife of Xenophon, if your female neighbour had <lb/>
            better gold than you have, would you prefer hers or your own ? <lb/>
            Hers, replied she. And if she had dress and other ornaments <lb/>
            suited to women, of more value than those which you have, <lb/>
            would tou prefer your own or hers ? Hers, assuredly, said she. <lb/>
            Tell me then, added Aspasia, if she had a better husband than <lb/>
            you have, whether would you prefer your husband or hers ? <lb/>
            29. At this question the woman blushed; and not without <lb/>
            reason; for she had answered incautiously at first, in say­ <lb/>
            ing that she would rather have her neighbour’s gold than <lb/>
            her own; as covetousness is unjustifiable. But if she had <lb/>
            answered that she would prefer her own gold to be like the <lb/>
            better gold of her neighbour, she might then have answered, <lb/>
            consistently with modesty, that she would prefer her husband <lb/>
            to be like the better husband of her neighbour.</p>
          <p>30. I know that some writers have, with useless diligence, <lb/>
            distinguished comparison into several almost imperceptibly <lb/>
            different kinds, and have said that there is a minor similitude, <note type="footnote">reader and commentator, as is the case here; but I suppose that be <lb/>

            as that of an ape to a mart, or that of imperfectly formed statues <lb/>
            to their originals; and a greater similitude, as an egg, we say, is <lb/>
            not so like an egg, as dc.; and that there is also similitude in <lb/>
            things unlike, as in an ant and an elephant in genus, both <lb/>
            being animals, and dissimilitude in things that are like, as <lb/>
            whelps are unlike to dogs and kids to goats, for they differ in <lb/>
            age. 31. They say, too, that there are different kinds of con­ <lb/>
            traries: such as an opposite, as night to day; such as are hurt­ <lb/>
            ful, as cold water to fever; such as are repugnant, as truth to <lb/>
            falsehood; such as are negatively opposed, as hard things to <lb/>
            those which are not hard. But I do not see that such distinc­ <lb/>
            tions have any great concern with my present subject.</p>
          <p>32. It is more to our purpose to observe, that arguments <lb/>
            are drawn from similar, opposite, and dissimilar points of law. <lb/>
            From similar, as Cicero shows, in his Topics,f that the heir, to <lb/>
            whom the possession of a house for his life has been bequeathed, <lb/>
            will not rebuild it if it falls down, because he would not replace <lb/>
            a slave if he should die. From opposite points, as, There is <lb/>
            no reason why there should not be a valid marriage between <lb/>
            parties who unite with mutual consent, even if no contract has <lb/>
            been signed; for it would be to no purpose that a contract had <lb/>
            been signed, if it should be proved that there was no consent to <lb/>
            the marriage. 33. From dissimilar points, as in the speech of <lb/>
            Cicero for Cæcina ;†Since, if any one had compelled me to <lb/>
            quit my house by force, I should have ground for an action <lb/>
            against him, shall I have no ground for action if a man pre­ <lb/>
            vents me by force from entering it ? Dissimilar points may be <lb/>
            thus stated: If a man who has bequeathed another all his silver <lb/>
            may be considered to have left hint all his coined silver, it is not <lb/>
            on that account to be supposed that he intended all that was on <lb/>
            his books to be given to him.</p>
          <p>34. Some have separated analogy from similitude; I con­ <lb/>
            sider it comprehended in similitude. For when we say, As <lb/>
            one is to ten, so are ten to a hundred, there is a similitude, as <lb/>
            much as there is when we say, As is an enemy, so is a bad <lb/>
            citizen. But arguments from similitude are carried still <lb/>
            further; as, If a connexion with a male slave is disgraceful to <lb/>
            a mistress, a connexion with a female slave is disgraceful to a <lb/>
            master. If pleasure is the chief object of brutes, it may also be <note type="footnote"> *C. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> t a 12. </note> <pb n="371"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            that of men. 35. But an argument from what is dissimilar in <lb/>
            the cases very easily meets such propositions: It is not the <lb/>
            same thing for a master to form a connexion with a female <lb/>
            slave as for a mistress to form one with a male slave; or from <lb/>
            what is contrary: Because it is the chief object of brutes, it <lb/>
            should for that very reason not be the chief object of rational <lb/>
            beings.</p>
          <p>36. Among external supports for a cause, are also to be <lb/>
            numbered authorities. Those who follow the Greeks, by whom <lb/>
            they are termed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰϱίσεις</foreign>, call them judicia or judicationes, <lb/>
            "judgments" or “adjudications,” not on matters on which a <lb/>
            judicial sentence has been pronounced, (for such matters must <lb/>
            be considered as precedents,) but on whatever can be adduced <lb/>
            as expressing the opinions of nations or people, or of wise <lb/>
            men; eminent political characters, or illustrious poets. 37. Nor <lb/>
            will even common sayings, established by popular belief, be <lb/>
            without their use in this way; for they are a kind of testi­ <lb/>
            monies, and are so much the stronger, as they are not <lb/>
            invented to serve particular cases, but have been said and <lb/>
            confirmed * by minds free from hatred or partiality, merely <lb/>
            because they. appeared most agreeable to virtue and truth. <lb/>
            38. If I speak of the calamities of life, -will not the opinion of <lb/>
            those nations t support me, who witness births with tears, and <lb/>
            deaths with joy ? Or if I recommend mercy to a judge, will it <lb/>
            not support my application to observe that the eminently <lb/>
            wise nation of the Athenians regarded mercy not as a mere <lb/>
            affection of the mind, but as a. deity?: 39. As for the <lb/>
            precepts of the seven wise men, do we not consider them as <lb/>
            so many rules of life ? If an adulteress is accused of poison­ <lb/>
            ing, does she not seem already condemned by the sentence of <lb/>
            Cato, who said that every adulteress was also ready to become a <lb/>
            poisoner ?With maxims from the poets, not only the compo­ <lb/>
            sitions of orators are filled, but the books also of philosophers <lb/>
            who, though they think everything else inferior to their own <lb/>
            teaching and writings, have yet not disdained to seek authority <note type="footnote"> * Dicta factaque.] None of the commentators make any remark on <lb/>

            from great numbers of verses. 40. Nor is it a mean example <lb/>
            of the influence of poetry, that when the Megareans and <lb/>
            Athenians contended for the possession of the isle of Salamis, <lb/>
            the Megareans were overcome by the Athenians on the <lb/>
            authority of a verse of Homer,* (which, however, is not found <lb/>
            in every edition,) signifying that Ajax united his ships with <lb/>
            those of the Athenians. 41. Sayings, too, which have been <lb/>
            generally received, become as it were common property, for <lb/>
            the very reason that they have no certain author; such as <lb/>
            Where there are friends, there is wealth ; Conscience is instead <lb/>
            of a thousand witnesses it and, as Cicero ‡has it, Like people, <lb/>
            as it is in the old proverb, generally join themselves with like. <lb/>
            Such sayings, indeed, would not have endured from time <lb/>
            immemorial, had they not been thought true by everybody.</p>
          <p>42. By some writers, the authority of the gods, as given in <lb/>
            oracles, is specified under this head, and placed, indeed, in the <lb/>
            first rank; for instance, the oracle that Socrates was the wisest <lb/>
            of men. To this an allusion is rarely made, though Cicero <lb/>
            appeals to it in his speech De Aruspicum responsis, and in his <lb/>
            oration against Catiline,§ when he points the attention of the <lb/>
            people to the statue of Jupiter placed upon the column, and in <lb/>
            pleading for Ligarius,|| when he allows that the cause of Cæsar <lb/>
            is the better as the gods have given judgment to that effect. <lb/>
            Such attestations, when they are peculiarly inherent in the <lb/>
            cause, are called divine testimonies; when they are adduced from <lb/>
            without, arguments. 43. Sometimes, too, we may have an <lb/>
            opportunity of availing ourselves of a saying or act of the judge, <lb/>
            or of our adversary, or of the advocate that pleads against us, <lb/>
            to support the credit of what we assert.</p>
          <p>Hence there have been some that have placed examples, <lb/>
            and authorities in the number of inartificial proofs, as the <lb/>
            orator does not invent them, but merely adopts them. <lb/>
            44. But there is a great difference; for witnesses, and exami­ <lb/>
            nations, and like matters, decide on the subject that is before the <note type="footnote"> * Il. ii. 558. See Villoison Proleg. in Horn.; also Arid. Rhet. i. 15, <lb/>

          <p>How far we may use doubtful grounds of argument, § 1—3. Some <lb/>
            arguments to be urged in a body, some singly, 4, 5. Some to be <lb/>
            carefully supported, and referred to particular points in our case, <lb/>
            6, 7. Not to be too numerous, 8. Arguments from the charac­ <lb/>
            ters of persons, 9—13. In what order arguments should be <lb/>
            advanced, 14. Quintilian states summarily what others have <lb/>
            given at greater length, 15—17. Argument too much neglected <lb/>
            in the exercises of the schools, 17—23.</p>
          <p>1. SUCH are the notions, for the most part, which I have <lb/>
            hitherto held concerning proof, either as conveyed to me by <lb/>
            others, or as gathered from my own experience. I have not <lb/>
            the presumption to intimate that what I have said on the sub­ <lb/>
            ject is all that can be said; on the contrary, I exhort the <lb/>
            student to search after me, and allow the possibility of more <lb/>
            being discovered ; but whatever is added, will be pretty much <lb/>
            the same with what I have stated. I will now subjoin a few <lb/>
            remarks on the mode in which we must make use of proofs.</p>
          <p>2. It is generally laid down as a principle that a proof <lb/>
            must be something certain, for how can what is doubtful be <lb/>
            proved by what is doubtful ? Yet some things, which we allege <lb/>
            in proof of something else, require proof themselves. You <lb/>
            killed your husband, for you were an adulteress* Here we <lb/>
            must bring proof as to the adultery, that, when that point <lb/>
            appears to be established, it may become a proof -of the other <lb/>
            which is doubtful. Your weapon was found in the body of the <lb/>
            murdered man; the accused denies that the weapon is his; <lb/>
            and we must establish this circumstance in order to prove the <lb/>
            charge. 3. But it is one of the admonitions necessary to be <lb/>
            given here, that no proofs are stronger than those which have <lb/>
            been shown to be certain after having appeared to be doubtful. <lb/>
            You committed the murder, for you had your apparel stained <lb/>
            with blood. Here the allegation that his apparel was stained <note type="footnote"> * Comp. c. 11, sect. 39. </note> <pb n="374"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V </note> <lb/>
            with blood is not so strong an argument against the accused <lb/>
            if he admits it, as if he denies it and it is proved ; for if he <lb/>
            admits it, his apparel may have been stained with blood from <lb/>
            many causes, but if he denies it, he hinges his cause on that <lb/>
            very point, and, if he is convicted on that point, he can make <lb/>
            no stand on anything that follows ; since it will be thought <lb/>
            that he would not have had recourse to falsehood to deny the <lb/>
            fact, if he had not despaired of justifying himself if he ad­ <lb/>
            mitted it.</p>
          <p>4. We must insist on the strongest of our arguments singly ; <lb/>
            the weaker must be advanced in a body ; for the former kind, <lb/>
            which are strong in themselves, we must not obscure by sur­ <lb/>
            rounding matter, but take care that they may appear exactly <lb/>
            as they are; the other sort, which are naturally weak, will sup­ <lb/>
            port themselves by mutual aid; and, therefore, if they cannot <lb/>
            prevail from being strong, they will prevail from being nume­ <lb/>
            rous. as the object of all is to establish the same point. <lb/>
            5. Thus, if any person should accuse another of having killed <lb/>
            a man for the sake of his property, and should say, You <lb/>
            expected to succeed to the inheritance, and a large inheritance <lb/>
            it was; you were poor, and were greatly harassed by your <lb/>
            creditors; and you had offended him to whom you were heir, <lb/>
            and knew that he intended to alter his will; the allegations, <lb/>
            considered separately, have little weight and nothing peculiar, <lb/>
            but, brought forward in a body, they produce a damaging <lb/>
            effect, if not with the force of a thunderbolt, at least with that <lb/>
            of a shower of hail.</p>
          <p>6. Some arguments it is not sufficient merely to advance; <lb/>
            ihey must be supported; as, if you say that covetousness was <lb/>
            the cause of a crime, you must show how great the influence oj <lb/>
            covetousness is; or if you say anger, you must observe how <lb/>
            much power that passion has over the minds of men ; thus <lb/>
            the arguments will be both stronger in themselves, and will <lb/>
            appear with more grace, from not presenting, as it were, their <lb/>
            limbs unapparelled or denuded of flesh. 7. If, again, we rest <lb/>
            a charge upon a motive of hatred, it will be of importance to <lb/>
            show whether it arose from envy, or from injury, or from am­ <lb/>
            bition ; whether it was old or recent; whether it was entertained <lb/>
            towards an inferior, an equal, or a superior, a stranger or a <lb/>
            relative; for all such circumstances require peculiar considera <lb/>
            tion, and must be turned to the advantage of the side which <pb n="375"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.XII.] </note> <lb/>
            we defend. 8. Yet we must not load a judge with all the argu­ <lb/>
            ments that we can invent; for such an accumulation would <lb/>
            both tire his patience and excite his mistrust, since he can <lb/>
            hardly suppose those proofs sufficiently valid, which we our­ <lb/>
            selves, who offer them, seem to regard as unsatisfactory. On <lb/>
            the other hand, to argue in support of a matter that is clear, is <lb/>
            as foolish as to bring a common taper into the brightest <lb/>
            sunshine.</p>
          <p>9. To these kinds of proof some add those which they call <lb/>
            pathetic, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παθητϰάς</foreign>, drawn from thefeelings;* and Aristotle, <lb/>
            indeed, thinks that the most powerful argument on the part <lb/>
            of him who speaks is that he be a good man; and as this will <lb/>
            have the best effect, so toseem good ranks next to it, though <lb/>
            far below it. 10. Hence that noble defence of Scaurus :+ <lb/>
            Quintus Varius of Sucro says that Æmilius Scaurus has <lb/>
            betrayed the interests of the people of Rome; Æmilius Scaurus <lb/>
            denies it. Iphicrates, too, is said to have justified himself in <lb/>
            a similar manner;‡ for having asked Aristophon, by whom, as <lb/>
            accuser, he was charged with a like offence, whether he would <lb/>
            betray his country on receiving a sum of money, and Aristophon <lb/>
            having replied that he would not, Have I, then, rejoined Iphi­ <lb/>
            crates, done what you would not do ? 11. But we must <lb/>
            consider what is the character of the judge before whom we <lb/>
            plead, and ascertain what is likely to appear most probable to <lb/>
            him ; a point on which I have spoken § both in my directions <lb/>
            regarding the exordium, and on those regarding deliberative <lb/>
            oratory.</p>
          <p>12. There is another mode of proof in asseveration: I did <lb/>
            this: You told me this: 0 horrible deed! and the like. Such <lb/>
            affirmations ought not to be wanting in any pleading, and, if <lb/>
            they are wanting, their absence has a very ill effect. They <lb/>
            are not to be accounted, however, as great supports, because <lb/>
            they may be made on either side, in the same cause, with <lb/>
            equal positiveness. 13. Those proofs are stronger which are <lb/>
            drawn from the character of a person, and have some credible <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παθητίκὰς</foreign> vocant, ductas ex affectibus.] Turnebus and Cappe­ <lb/>
            ronier think that we should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠθικάς</foreign>, which indeed suits better <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.V </note> <lb/>
            reason to support them : as, It is not likely that a wounded <lb/>
            man, or one whose son has been murdered, would mean to accuse <lb/>
            any other than the guilty person; since, if he makes a charge <lb/>
            against an innocent person, he would let the guilty escape <lb/>
            punishment. It is from such reasoning that fathers seek sup­ <lb/>
            port when they accuse their sons ;* or others, whoever they <lb/>
            may be, that accuse their own relatives.</p>
          <p>14. It is also inquired, whether the strongest arguments <lb/>
            should be placed in front, that they may take forcible possession <lb/>
            of the judge's mind, or in the rear, that they may leave an im­ <lb/>
            pression upon it, or partly in front and partly in the rear, so <lb/>
            that, according to Homer's arrangement,! the weakest may be <lb/>
            in the middle ; or whether they should be in a progressive <lb/>
            order, commencing with the weakest. But the disposition of <lb/>
            the arguments must be such as the nature of the cause re­ <lb/>
            quires ; a rule, as I think, with only one exception, that our <lb/>
            series must not descend from the strongest to the weakest.</p>
          <p>15. Contenting myself with giving these brief intimations <lb/>
            respecting arguments, I have offered them in such a way as to <lb/>
            show, with as much clearness as I could, the topics and heads <lb/>
            from which they are derived. Some writers have descanted <lb/>
            on them more diffusely, having thought proper to speak of the <lb/>
            whole subject of common places, and to show in what manner <lb/>
            every particular topic may be treated. 16. But to me such <lb/>
            detail appeared superfluous; for it occurs almost to every <lb/>
            person what is to be said against envy, or avarice, or a mali­ <lb/>
            cious witness, or powerful friends, and to speak on all such <lb/>
            subjects would be an endless task, as much as if I should <lb/>
            undertake to enumerate all the questions, arguments, and <lb/>
            opinions in all cases now depending, or that will ever arise. <lb/>
            IT. I have not the confidence to suppose that I have pointed <lb/>
            out all the sources of argument, but I consider that I have <lb/>
            specified the greater number.</p>
          <p>Such specification required the greater care, as the declama­ <lb/>
            tions, in which we used to exercise ourselves, as military men <lb/>
            with foils‡, for the battles of the forum, have for some time <note type="footnote"> * Alleging that they would not bring them to judgment unless they <lb/>

            being composed merely to please, are destitute of vigour, there <lb/>
            being the same evil practice among declaimers, assuredly, as <lb/>
            that which slave-dealers adopt, when they try to add to the <lb/>
            beauty of young fellows by depriving them of their virility. <lb/>
            18. For as slave-dealers regard strength and muscles, and <lb/>
            more especially the beard and other distinctions which nature <lb/>
            has appropriated to males, as at variance with grace, and <lb/>
            soften down, as being harsh, whatever would be strong if it <lb/>
            were allowed its full growth, so we cover the manly form of <lb/>
            eloquence, and the ability of speaking closely and forcibly, <lb/>
            with a certain delicate texture of language, and, if our words <lb/>
            be but smooth and elegant, think it of little consequence what <lb/>
            vigour they have. 19. But to me, who look to nature, any <lb/>
            man, with the full appearance of virility, will be more pleasing <lb/>
            than a eunuch; nor will divine providence ever be so unfavour­ <lb/>
            able to its own work as to ordain that weakness be numbered <lb/>
            among its excellences; nor shall I think that an animal is <lb/>
            made beautiful by the knife, which would have been a monster <lb/>
            if it had been born in the state to which the knife has reduced <lb/>
            it. Let a deceitful resemblance to the female sex serve the <lb/>
            purposes of licentiousness if it will, but licentiousness will <lb/>
            never attain such power as to render that, which it has rendered <lb/>
            valuable for its own purposes, also honourable. 20. Such effe­ <lb/>
            minate eloquence, therefore, however audiences, overcome with <lb/>
            pleasure, may applaud it, I (for I shall speak what I think) <lb/>
            shall never consider worthy of the name of eloquence, <lb/>
            language which bears in it not the least indication of manliness <lb/>
            or purity, to say nothing of gravity or sanctity, in the speaker. <lb/>
            21. When the most eminent sculptors and painters, if they <lb/>
            sought to represent the highest personal beauty in stone or on <lb/>
            canvas, never fell into the error of taking a Bagoas or <lb/>
            Megabyzus for their model, but choose a young Doryphorus.§ <lb/>
            fitted alike for war or the palæstra, and consider the persons <lb/>

            who study to form a perfect orator, give him, not the arms, but <lb/>
            the tinkling cymbals, of eloquence ? 22. Let the youth whom <lb/>
            I am instructing, therefore, devote himself, as much as he can, <lb/>
            to the imitation of truth, and, as he is to engage in frequent <note type="footnote"> * Alluding to the statue of Polycletus, which he made viriliter <lb/>

          <p>Refutation twofold, § 1. Why it is more difficult to defend than to <lb/>
            accuse, 3, 3. Deprecation not to be adopted without some ground <lb/>
            of defence, 4—6. Nothing to be gained by silence in regard to <lb/>
            matters that cannot be defended, 7—11. We may attack some of <lb/>
            our adversary's arguments in a body, some singly, 12—14. What <lb/>
            arguments may be easily refuted, 15, 16. What arguments of <lb/>
            our adversary may be turned to our advantage, 17, 18. Many <lb/>
            will fall under conjecture, definition, quality, 19—21. Some of <lb/>
            the adversary’s arguments may be treated as unworthy of notice, <lb/>
            22. Precedents, which he assumes to be applicable to his case, <lb/>
            we must endeavour to prove inapplicable, 23, 24. We may repeat <lb/>
            the statements of the adversary so as to weaken them, 25—27. <lb/>
            We may sometimes expose the whole charge, sometimes particular <lb/>
            parts of it, 28. How we make arguments common to both sides <lb/>
            adverse to us ; how discrepancies in the pleading of the adversary <lb/>
            are to be exposed, 29—33. Some faults easily shown, 34, 35. <lb/>
            Not to neglect arguments of our adversary, and not to be too <lb/>
            anxious to refute them all, 36, 37. How far we should spare our <lb/>
            adversary personally, 38—-44. Some pleaders, in endeavouring to <lb/>
            expose their adversaries, give occasion against themselves, 45—48. <lb/>
            Sometimes, however, we may represent that there are contradic­ <lb/>
            tions in his statements, 49, 50. A pleader ought to appear con­ <lb/>
            fident of the justice of his cause, 51, 52. Order which we must <lb/>
            observe in supporting our own arguments and refuting those of <lb/>
            the opposite party, 53-55. We must support our proofs and <lb/>
            refutations by the power of eloquence, 56—58. Foolish dispute <lb/>
            between Theodorus and Apollodorus, 59, 60.</p>
          <p>1. Refutation may be understood in two senses; for the <lb/>
            part of the defender consists wholly in refutation; and what­ <lb/>
            ever is said by either party in opposition to the other, requires <lb/>
            to be refuted. It is properly in the latter sense that the <lb/>
            fourth place* is assigned to it in judicial pleadings. But the <lb/>
            manner of conducting both is similar; for the principles of <lb/>
            argument in refutation can be drawn from no other sources <lb/>
            than those used in affirmation ; nor is the nature of the com­ <lb/>
            mon places, or thoughts, or words, or figures,† at all different. <lb/>
            2. It has, in general, little to do with moving the passions.</p>
          <p>It is not without reason, however, that it is thought more <note type="footnote"> * There are five parts in a cause, or judicial pleading, the exordium, <lb/>
            the statement of facts, the confirmation, the refutation, and the pero­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.V </note> <lb/>
            difficult (as Cicero* often testifies) to defend than to accuse. <lb/>
            In the first place, accusation is more simple, for a charge may <lb/>
            be brought in one way, but may be overthrown in many ; and <lb/>
            it is sufficient for the accuser, in general, that what he advances <lb/>
            appear true; while the defendant has to deny, to justify, to <lb/>
            take exceptions,† to excuse, to deprecate, to soften, to extenu­ <lb/>
            ate, to avert, to affect contempt,‡ to ridicule ; and accordingly, <lb/>
            on the accuser's side, the pleading is for the most part straight­ <lb/>
            forward and, so to speak, open-mouthed ; while on that of the <lb/>
            defendant a thousand turns and artifices are required. <lb/>
            3. The accuser, too, generally sets forth what he has previously <lb/>
            meditated at leisure; the defendant has frequently to oppose <lb/>
            what is entirely unexpected. The accuser produces his wit­ <lb/>
            nesses ; the defendant has to refute him by arguments drawn <lb/>
            from the cause itself. The accuser finds matter for his speech <lb/>
            in the odiousness of the charges,§ even though they are false, <lb/>
            as parricide, for instance, or sacrilege, or treachery to the <lb/>
            state; which the defendant can only deny. Hence even mode­ <lb/>
            rate speakers have succeeded in accusations ; while none but <lb/>
            the most eloquent have proved able defenders ; for,To dispatch <lb/>
            what I mean in a word, it is as much more easy to accuse than <lb/>
            to defend, as it is to make wounds than to cure them.</p>
          <p>4. It is a point of great importance to consider what the <lb/>
            opposite party has said, and in what manner. We must first <lb/>
            of all examine, therefore, whether that which we have to <lb/>
            answer belongs properly to the cause, or has been introduced <lb/>
            into it extrinsically ; for if it be inherent in the cause, we must <lb/>
            either deny it, or justify it, or prove that the action is illegally <lb/>
            brought; besides these there is scarcely any means of defence <lb/>
            in any kind of trial. 5. Deprecation,|| at least such as is without <lb/>
            appearance of defence, is extremely rare, and before such <note type="footnote"> * Spalding observes that he cannot direct his reader to any passages <lb/>
            of the kind in Cicero. Turnebus refers to De Off. ii. 14, but that <lb/>
            passage is hardly applicable to the subject; "another to which he <lb/>
            refers in the Orator," says Spalding, “I cannot find. That Cicero was <lb/>
            oftener engaged in defences than in accusations is apparent from his <lb/>
            own testimony in the Divinatio in Cœcilium, and from his speeches." </note><note type="footnote"> t Transferat.] See note on HiL 6, 23. </note><note type="footnote"> t Comp. iv. 1, 38; v. 13, 22. </note><note type="footnote"> § A ccusatorcriminum invidiâ, &amp;c.

            judges only as are confined to no certain form of decision ;* <lb/>
            and even those pleadings! before Caius Cæsar and the Trium­ <lb/>
            viri, in behalf of men of the opposite party, though they <lb/>
            depend chiefly on intreaty, yet mingle with it some defensive <lb/>
            arguments; for it is surely the expression of a bold defender <lb/>
            to exclaim,‡ What object have we had in view, Tubero, but that <lb/>
            we might have the power which Cæsar now has ? 6. But if on <lb/>
            any occasion, in pleading for another before a sovereign prince, <lb/>
            or any other personage who may condemn or acquit at his <lb/>
            pleasure, we have to say that he whose cause we undertake is <lb/>
            worthy indeed of death, but of such a character that his life <lb/>
            may be spared by a merciful judge, we must consider, first of <lb/>
            all, that we shall not have to do with an adversary, but with <lb/>
            an arbitrator, and, in the next, that we shall have to adopt the <lb/>
            style of deliberative rather than of judicial oratory; for we <lb/>
            shall have to counsel him to prefer the praise of humanity to <lb/>
            the pleasure of vengeance. 7. As for pleadings before judges <lb/>
            that must give sentence according to law, it would be ridicu­ <lb/>
            lous to offer precepts in regard to those who confess their guilt. <lb/>
            Charges, therefore, which cannot be denied, or set aside by <lb/>
            taking exceptions on a point of law, must be justified, what­ <lb/>
            ever be their nature, or we must abandon our cause.</p>
          <p>Of negation I have specified two forms; that the matter in <lb/>
            question did not happen, or that what did happen is not the <lb/>
            matter in question. What cannot be justified, or set aside on <lb/>
            a point of law, must necessarily be denied, not only if a defini­ <lb/>
            tion of it may prove in our favour, but even if nothing but <lb/>
            simple denial is left to us. 8. If witnesses be produced, we <lb/>
            may say against them; if writings, we maydescant on <lb/>
            the resemblance of hands. Certainly nothing can be worse <lb/>
            than confession. When there is no ground either for justifica­ <lb/>
            tion or denial, the last resource for maintaining our cause is <lb/>
            legal exception. 9. But,it may be said, there are some <lb/>
            charges which can neither be denied nor justified, and to <note type="footnote"> * Turnebus and Gedoyn understand judges that are above the law, <lb/>
            as sovereign princes, the senate, or the people. Spalding thinks that <lb/>
            the allusion is to such judges as are meant, iii. 10, 1, to whom the <lb/>
            praetor might appoint multas et diversasformulas judicandi. The <lb/>
            former notion seems to suit better with what follows. </note><note type="footnote"> t We have no knowledge of any such pleadings except that or <lb/>

            which no legal exception can be taken. A woman is accused, <lb/>
            for instance, of adultery, who, after being a widow a year, had <lb/>
            a child; here there can be no case for the judge. It is, there­ <lb/>

            should be pretended to be forgotten and passed in silence, <lb/>
            for that is the point on which the judge has to pronounce. <lb/>
            10. But if what the accuser alleges be foreign to the cause, <lb/>
            or merely accessory to it, I should prefer to say in the de­ <lb/>
            fence that it has nothing to do with the question, that it is <lb/>
            needless to dwell upon it, and that it is of less importance <lb/>
            than our adversary represents it; or I might, indeed, in such <lb/>
            a case, pardon the pretence of forgetfulness to which I just <lb/>
            now alluded; for a good advocate ought not to fear a slight <lb/>
            censure for negligence if he can thus save his client.</p>
          <p>11. We must consider also whether we ought to attack the <lb/>
            charges of an accuser in a body, or overthrow them one by one. <lb/>
            We may assail a number at once, if they are either so weak that <lb/>
            they may be borne down in a mass, or so annoying that it is <lb/>
            not expedient to engage them in detail; for we must then <lb/>
            struggle with our whole force, and, if I may be allowed <lb/>
            the expression, must fight with the enemy front to front. <lb/>
            12. Sometimes, if it be difficult to refute the allegations <lb/>
            on the other side, we may compare our arguments with <lb/>
            those of our opponents, provided there be a probability of <lb/>
            making ours appear the stronger. Such arguments against us <lb/>
            as are strong from their number must be separated ; as, in the <lb/>
            example which I gave a little above, You were the heir of the <lb/>
            deceased; you were poor ; you were harassed for a large sum of <lb/>
            money by your creditors; you had offended the deceased, and <lb/>
            you know that he purposed to alter his will. 13. These argu­ <lb/>
            ments, taken together, have much weight; but if you divide <lb/>
            them, and consider them separately, they will be like a great <lb/>
            flame, which had its strength from a largemass of fuel, but <lb/>
            which will dwindle away when that which nourished it is with­ <lb/>
            drawn, or like large rivers, which, if they are divided into <lb/>
            rivulets, become fordable in any part. The form of our refu­ <lb/>
            tation, therefore, must be adapted to the interest of our cause; <lb/>
            we may sometimes state the arguments of our adversary sepa­ <lb/>
            rately, and sometimes collect them into a body ; 14. for, in <lb/>
            certain cases, what our opponent has deduced from several <lb/>
            particulars, it will be sufficient for us to include in a single <pb n="383"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.XIII] </note> <lb/>
            proposition; for example, if the accuser shall say that the <lb/>
            defendant had many motives for committing the crime with <lb/>
            which he charges him, we may, without recapitulating all the <lb/>
            alleged motives, deny simply that the argument from the motives <lb/>
            ought to be regarded, because it is not to be supposed that <lb/>
            every man who had a motive for committing a crime has com­ <lb/>
            mitted it. 15. Yet it is best for the prosecutor, in general, to <lb/>
            group arguments and for the defendant to disperse them.</p>
          <p>But the defendant must consider in what manner that which <lb/>
            has been stated by the prosecutor must be refuted. If it be <lb/>
            evidently false, it will be sufficient to deny it; as Cicero, in <lb/>
            pleading for Cluentius,* denies that he, whom the accuser had <lb/>
            affirmed to have fallen down dead on drinking from a cup, <lb/>
            died the same day. 16. To refute allegations that are incon­ <lb/>
            sistent, or idle, or foolish, requires no art, and it is therefore <lb/>
            unnecessary to give either precepts or examples concerning <lb/>
            them. That also which is said to have been done in secret, <lb/>
            (they call it the obscure kind of charge,) and without witness <lb/>
            or proof, is sufficiently weak in itself (for it is enough that the <lb/>
            adversary cannot attest it) ; and it is the same with whatever <lb/>
            has no reference to the question. 17. It is the business of a <lb/>
            pleader, however, at times, to represent the statements of the <lb/>
            adversary in such a way that the may either appear contra­ <lb/>
            dictory, or foreign to the question, or incredible, or super­ <lb/>
            fluous, or favourable to our side rather than his own, It is a <lb/>
            charge against Oppius † that he embezzled the provisions intended <lb/>
            for the soldiers; a grave accusation ; but Cicero shows that it <lb/>
            was inconsistent with other charges brought by the same pro­ <lb/>
            secutors, who accused Oppius, at the same time, of attempting <lb/>
            to corrupt the soldiers with largesses. 18. The accuser of <lb/>
            Cornelius ‡ engages to produce wistnesses of the law having been <lb/>
            read by him when tribune; this charge Cicero renders in­ <lb/>
            effectual by admitting it. Quintus Cœcilius solicits the office of <lb/>
            prosecuting Verres, because he had been Verres' quœstor; but <lb/>
            Cicero § made that very circumstance appear in his own favour. <note type="footnote"> * C. 60. </note><note type="footnote"> t C. 10, sect. 69. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See iv. 3,13. </note><note type="footnote"> § Divinat. in Quint.

             <note type="margin">[B.V. </note> </p>
          <p>19. As to other charges, the mode of refuting them all is <lb/>
            much the same; for they are either to be examined by conjec­ <lb/>
            lure, whether they are true ; or by definition, whether they pro <lb/>
            perly concern the cause; or, with regard to their quality, <lb/>
            whether they are dishonourable, unjust, scandalous, inhuman, <lb/>
            cruel, or deserve any other designation that falls under the <lb/>
            head of quality. 20. It is to be considered, indeed, not only <lb/>
            with regard to the first charges in an action, but throughout <lb/>
            the whole of it, whether it be excessively rigorous, as that of <lb/>
            Labienus against Rabirius, under the lex perduellionis ;* or un­ <lb/>
            feeling, as that of Tubero against Ligarius, whom he accused <lb/>
            when an exile, and exerted himself to the utmost to prevent <lb/>
            Cæsar from pardoning him ; or presumptuous, as that against <lb/>
            Oppius when he was accused on a letter of Cotta. 21. In <lb/>
            like manner other actions may be contemplated, and shown to <lb/>
            be rash, insidious, or vindictive. But the strongest allegation <lb/>
            that you can bring against an action, is, either that it is fraught <lb/>
            with danger to the public, as Cicero says in his defence of <lb/>
            Tullius, † who has ever laid down such a maxim, or to whom <lb/>
            could it be permitted without danger to the whole community, to <lb/>
            kill a man because he says that he is apprehensive of being killed <lb/>
            by him ?‡ or to the judges themselves, as Cicero, speaking for <lb/>
            Oppius, exhorts the judges at some length that they should not <lb/>
            sanction that kind of action against the equestrian order. <lb/>
            22. For some arguments, again, contempt may be at times <note type="footnote"> * Rabirius was an aged senator, accused of having caused the death <lb/>
            of the Tribune Saturninus, forty years after that event had taken <lb/>
            place. Labienus brought the charge against him at the instigation of <lb/>
            Julius Cæsar, who wished to deter the senate from taking up arms <lb/>
            against the popular party. The accusation was made, not on the <lb/>
            ground of lœsa majestas, as was usual, but under the old lex per­ <lb/>
            duellionis, the severity of which is apparent from Livy, i. 26. The <lb/>
            duumviri appointed to try the cause, in conformity with that law, <lb/>
            were Julius Cæsar himself and his relative Lucius Caesar, by whom he <lb/>
            was condemned, and would have been put to death had he not <lb/>
            appealed to the people. The people, too, would have ratified his con­ <lb/>
            demnation, had it not been for a stratagem of Quintus Metellus Celer, <lb/>
            who removed the military flag that waved over the Janiculum, and <lb/>
            thus, according to ancient usage, broke off the proceedings. See Dion <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH.VII.J </note> <lb/>
            expressed, as being frivolous or having nothing to do with the <lb/>
            question; a course which Cicero frequently adopts; and this <lb/>
            affectation of contempt is sometimes carried so far, that we <lb/>
            trample with disdain as it were upon that which we should be <lb/>
            anable to refute by regular argument.</p>
          <p>23. But since the greater part of such charges is founded <lb/>
            upon resemblances* we must use our utmost efforts, in refuting <lb/>
            them, to discover some discrepancy in what is stated. This is <lb/>
            most easily found in legal questions; for the law, to which we <lb/>
            refer, was assuredly made with reference to other matters than <lb/>
            that under consideration; and so much more easily may varia­ <lb/>
            tion in the different cases be made to appear. t As to com­ <lb/>
            parisons drawn from brute animals, or inanimate objects, it is <lb/>
            easy to elude them. 24. As to examples from historical facts, <lb/>
            if they bear hard upon us, they may be met in various ways; <lb/>
            if they are ancient, we may treat them as fabulous; if they <lb/>
            cannot be doubted, we may endeavour to show that they are <lb/>
            inapplicable to the case; for it is impossible that two cases <lb/>
            should be alike in all respects; for instance, if Scipio Nasica, <lb/>
            after killing Gracchus, should be defended on the resemblance <lb/>
            of his act to that of Abala, ‡ by whom Mælius was killed, it <lb/>
            may be said that Mœlius aspired to sovereignty, but that <lb/>
            Gracchus only brought forward some popular laws; that Ahala <lb/>
            was master of the horse, but Nasica a private individual. If <lb/>
            all other means fail us, we must then see whether it can be <lb/>
            shown that even the fact adduced as a precedent was not justi­ <lb/>
            fiable. What is to be understood with regard to examples, is <lb/>
            also to be observed with regard to previous judgments.§</p>
          <p>25. From the remark which I made above that it is of impor­ <lb/>
            tant to notice in what manner || the accuser stated his charges, <lb/>
            I wish it to be understood, that if he has expressed himself but <lb/>
            feebly, his very words may be repeated by ourselves; or, if he <lb/>
            has used fierce and violent language, we may produce hismatter <lb/>
            in milder terms; 26. as Cicero says in his defence of Cornelius, <note type="footnote"> * Similibus constat.] Those arguments which are drawn à simili, or, <lb/>

            He took hold of the tablet of the law; * and this we may do with <lb/>
            a certain degree of deference to our client; so that, if we have <lb/>
            to speak on behalf of a man of pleasure, we may observe that a <lb/>
            rather free Course of life has been imputed to him and so we <lb/>
            call a person frugal instead of niggardly, or free of speech in­ <lb/>
            stead of slanderous A 27. We must at any rate take care not <lb/>
            to repeat our adversary's charges with their proofs, or to <lb/>
            amplify any point in them, unless such as we mean toridicule, <lb/>
            as is wing passage from Cicero ‡ You, have <lb/>
            been with the army, says he ; for so many years you have not <lb/>
            set foot in the forum; and, when you return after so long an <lb/>
            interval of time, do you contend for honours with those who have <lb/>
            made the forum as it were their dwelling-place ? 28. In replies, <lb/>
            too, the whole accusation may be sometimes repeated; a mode <lb/>
            which Cicero adopts in his defence of Scaurus with reference to <lb/>
            Bostar,§ speaking in the character of his antagonist; or, if <lb/>
            we do not repeat the whole, we may take parts of it, and put, <lb/>
            them together, as in Cicero's defence orv arenus: || When he <lb/>
            was travelling through fields and solitary places with Pompu­ <lb/>
            lenus, they met, as they said, the slaves of Ancharius, when <lb/>
            Pompulenus was killed, and Varenus immediately after bound, <lb/>
            and kept in custody till his father should signify what he wished <lb/>
            to be done with him. Such a mode may always be adopted <lb/>
            when the order of facts stated by the accuser appears impro­ <lb/>
            bable, and may be deprived of credit by a comment. Some­ <lb/>
            times points which prejudice us collectively may be separated; <lb/>
            and this is generally the safest method. Sometimes the parts <lb/>
            of a reply are naturally independent of each other; of which <lb/>
            no example need be given.</p>
          <p>29. Common arguments are easily apprehended, not only <lb/>
            because they may be used by either party, but because they are <lb/>
            of more service to the defendant than to the prosecutor; for I <lb/>
            think it no trouble to repeat what I have often intimated <note type="footnote"> * See iv. 4, 8. </note><note type="footnote"> t Comp. iv. 2, 117. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Pro Mursen. c. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> § iv. 1, 69.

            <note type="margin"> CH.XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            that he who is the first to employ a common argument, renders <lb/>
            itadverse to him; for that is adverse to him which his opponent <lb/>
            can use equally well. * You say it is not probable that Marcus <lb/>
            CoMa contemplated so great a crime; and is it credible, then, <lb/>
            that Oppius attempted to commit so great a crime ? 30. But <lb/>
            it is the part of a skilful pleader to discover in the case of <lb/>
            his adversary particulars that are at variance with one another, <lb/>
            or that may be made to appear at variance; and such contra­ <lb/>
            dictions are sometimes evident on the very face of a statement, <lb/>
            as those noticed by Cicero on the trial of Cælius; t Clodia <lb/>
            says that she lent Caelius money, which is a sign of great friend­ <lb/>
            ship on her part; yet alleges that poison was prepared for her <lb/>
            by Cœlius, which is a sign of the most violent hatred on his, <lb/>
            31. So, in his speech for Ligarius, ‡ Tubero, says he, makes it a <lb/>
            crime in Ligarius that he was in Africa; and yet complains <lb/>
            that he himself was not admitted into Africa by Ligarius. Some­ <lb/>
            times an inadvertent remark of our opponent affords us an <lb/>
            opportunity of exposing his statements; an opportunity given <lb/>
            chiefly by those who are fond of fine thoughts, and who, <lb/>
            enticed by some opening for their eloquence, do not suffi­ <lb/>
            ciently regard what they assert, fixing their attention on the <lb/>
            passage before them, and not on the whole scope of the cause. <lb/>
            32. What could appear more prejudicial to Cluentius § than <lb/>
            the mark of infamy set on him by the censors ? What could <lb/>
            have seemed more to his disadvantage than that the son of <lb/>
            Egnatius || bad been disinherited by his father for the very <lb/>
            crime of corrupt judgment by which Cluentius had procured <lb/>
            the condemnation of Oppianicus ? 33. But Cicero shows that <lb/>
            these two facts contradict one another: But I think that you, <lb/>
            Accius, should consider carefully whether you would have the <lb/>
            judgment of the censors, or that of Egnatius, to carry the greater <lb/>
            weight. If that of Egnatius, you think that judgment light <lb/>
            which the censors have pronouneed against others, for they <lb/>
            expelled this very Egnatius, whom you represent as a man oj <note type="footnote">this remark to his pupils orally, for there is no observation of the <lb/>
            kind to be found in the work before us.

            authority, from the senate. If that of the censors, they retained <lb/>

          <p>34. As to some faults, there is far more folly in committing <lb/>
            them than acuteness in noting them. I mean such as <lb/>
            advancing a disputable for an indisputable argument, a contro­ <lb/>
            verted for an acknowledged fact, a point common to many causes, <lb/>
            for one peculiar to the cause in hand, or introducing anything <lb/>
            vulgar, superfluous, too late for the purpose, or incredible. For <lb/>
            it is incident to incautious speakers to aggravate a charge, <lb/>
            when it is still to be proved; to dispute about an act when <lb/>
            the question is about the agent; to attempt what is impossi­ <lb/>
            ble ; to break off a discussion as finished when it is scarcely <lb/>
            commenced; to prefer speaking of the party instead of the <lb/>
            cause; to attribute to things the faults of persons, as, for <lb/>
            example, accusing the decemviral power instead of Appius; to <lb/>
            contradict what is evident; to say what may be taken in <lb/>
            another sense from that which they intend; to lose sight of <lb/>
            the main point of the cause ; to reply to something that is not <lb/>
            asserted. 36. This mode of reply, indeed, may be adopted as an <lb/>
            artifice in some cases, as when a bad cause requires to be sup­ <lb/>
            ported by foreign aid; thus when Verres* was accused of <lb/>
            extortion, he was defended for having bravely and actively <lb/>
            defended Sicily against pirates.</p>
          <p>36. The same rules may be given with regard to objections <lb/>
            that we may have to encounter; but they require the more <lb/>
            attention in this case, as many speakers fall into two opposite <lb/>
            errors as to objections. Some, even in the forum, neglect them <lb/>
            as matters troublesome and disagreeable, and content, for the <lb/>
            most part, with what they have premeditated, speak as if they <lb/>
            had no opponent; an error which is still more common in the <lb/>
            schools, in which not only are objections disregarded, but the <lb/>
            declamations themselves are in general so framed, that nothing <lb/>
            can be said on the opposite side. 37. Others, erring from too <lb/>
            great caution, think that they must reply, if not to every word, <lb/>
            at least to every thought or insinuation, even the lightest, of <lb/>
            their adversary; a task which is endless and superfluous; for <lb/>
            then it is the cause that is refuted, and not the pleader. For <lb/>
            my own part, I shall consider a speaker eloquent only when <note type="footnote"> * Cicero in Verr. v. 1. </note> <pb n="389"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.XIIT.] </note> <lb/>
            he speaks in such a way that whatever he says to benefit hia <lb/>
            party, the credit of it may seem to be due to his talent and <lb/>
            not to his cause, and, if he says anything to injure his party, <lb/>
            the blame of it may seem attributable to his cause and not to <lb/>
            his talent.</p>
          <p>38. Invectives, such as that against Rullus* for the <lb/>
            obscurity of his language, against Piso† for his foolishness of <lb/>
            speech, against Antony ‡ for his ignorance of things and <lb/>
            words, as well for his stolidity, are allowed to passion or just <lb/>
            resentment, and are of effect in exciting dislike towards those <lb/>
            whom the speaker may wishto render hateful. 39. The mode of <lb/>
            reply adopted towards advocates should be different; though at <lb/>
            times not only their mode of speech, but even their character, <lb/>
            their look, their walk, their air, are excusably attacked; as <lb/>
            Cicero, in speaking against Quintius,§ assails not only such <lb/>
            personal peculiarities, but even his purple-bordered toga <lb/>
            descending to his heels; for Quintius had pressed hard upon <lb/>
            Cluentius by his turbulent harangues.</p>
          <p>40. Sometimes, for the purpose of effacing an unpleasant <lb/>
            impression, what is said severely by one party is eluded with a <lb/>
            jest by the other. In this way Triarius was mocked by <lb/>
            Cicero; for when he had observed that the pillars of the house <lb/>
            of Scaurus were conveyed through the city on waggons, Cicero <lb/>
            retorted, And I, who have pillars from the Alban mount, had <lb/>
            them brought in panniers. Such ridicule is more freely allowed <lb/>
            against an accuser, whom concern for his client sometimes leads <lb/>
            a defender to assail with severity. 41. But what is allowed <lb/>
            against all violation of good manners, is <lb/>
            complaint, if they can be said to have craftily passed in silence, <lb/>
            or abbreviated, or obscured, or put off any point. 42. A <lb/>
            change in the direction the defence, too, is often a subject of <lb/>
            blame; a point on which Acclusll objects in pleading against <lb/>
            Cluentius, and Æschines¶ in his speech against Ctesiphon, <lb/>
            Accius complaining that Cicero would adhere only to the letter <lb/>
            of the law, and Æchines that Demosthenes would say nothing <note type="footnote"> * Cic. De Lege Agrariâ, ii. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> + Cic. in Pis. c. 1 and 30. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡Philipp. ii. 4; iii. 4; xiii. 19. </note><note type="footnote"> § Cic. pro Cluent. c. 40. </note><note type="footnote"> || Cic. pro Cluent. c 52. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶Comp. ii. 6, 3. </note> <pb n="390"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V </note> <lb/>
            on the subject of the law. But our declaimers should be <lb/>
            especially admonished not to offer such objections as may be <lb/>
            easily answered, or imagine, that their opponent is an absolute <lb/>
            fool. But as fertile common-places, and thoughts that may <lb/>
            please the multitude, occur to us, we make to ourselves matter <lb/>
            for our speeches, moulding it to our fancy; so that this verse <lb/>
            may be not disadvantageously borne in mind: <lb/>
            Non malè rupondit; malè enim prior Hit rogârat* <lb/>
            The answer's nonsense; that we all admit; <lb/>
            But nonsense only could th' objection fit.</p>
          <p>43. Such a practice will be fatal to us in the forum, where <lb/>
            we shall have to reply to our adversary, and not to ourselves. <lb/>
            It is said that Accius being asked why he did not plead causes, <lb/>
            when he displayed in his tragedies such power in making <lb/>
            able replies, gave this reason, that on the stage he made his <lb/>
            characters say what he wished, but that in the forum his <lb/>
            adversaries would say what he did not wish. 44. It is there­ <lb/>
            fore ridiculous in exercises which are preparatory to the forum, <lb/>
            to consider what reply may be made before we consider what <lb/>
            objections may be offered; and a good teacher ought to com­ <lb/>
            mend a pupil when he ably imagines anythinng favourable to <lb/>
            the opposite side asmuch aswhen he conceives anything <lb/>
            serviceable to his own.</p>
          <p>45.There is another practice with regard to objections that <lb/>
            seems to be always permissible in the schools, but ought rarely <lb/>
            to be allowed in the forum. For where when we have to-speak <lb/>
            first on the side of the prosecutor,! in a real cause, how can <lb/>
            we make replies to objections, when our opponent has not yet <lb/>
            spoken? 46. Many speakers, however, fall into this absurdity, <lb/>
            whether from a habit contracted in the schools, or from fond­ <lb/>
            ness for speaking, and afford amusement and sport to those <lb/>
            who answer them, and who sometimes jestingly remark that <lb/>
            they said nothing, and could have said nothing so foolish ; <lb/>
            sometimes, that they have been well reminded by their opponent, <lb/>
            and thank him for his assistance; but most frequently, what is, <lb/>
            indeed, a very strong argument in their favour, that their oppo­ <note type="footnote"> * Whence this verse comes, says Spalding, I know not. I have <lb/>
            borrowed Guthrie's translation of it. </note><note type="footnote"> t Nam loco a petitore primo ] Quando prime loco dicimus d petitor. <lb/>

            nent would never have replied to objections that had not been <lb/>
            made, unless he knew that such objections were well founded, <lb/>
            and had been impelled to acknowledge their justice by the voice <lb/>
            of conscience. 47. Thus Cicero, in his speech for Cluentius * <lb/>
            says, You have repeatedly observed, that you are informed that <lb/>
            I intend to defend this cause by the aid of the letter of the law. <lb/>
            Is it so ? Am I then to suppose that I aiM secretly betrayed by <lb/>
            my friends ? Is there some one among those, whom I fancy to <lb/>
            be my friends, that reports my designs to the enemy ? Who is <lb/>
            it that told you of my intention ? Who has been so perfidious ? <lb/>
            To whom have I communicated it? No one, I conceive, is <lb/>
            to blame; it was, doubtless, the law itself that informed you. <lb/>
            48. But some, not content with answering imaginary objec­ <lb/>
            dons, amplify whole portions of them, saying that they knew <lb/>
            the opposite party would say so and so, and support their <lb/>
            assertions with such and such arguments. This practice Vibias <lb/>
            Crispus, a man of pleasing and refined humour, very happily <lb/>
            ridiculed when I was at the bar: I, said he, in reply to an <lb/>
            opponent of that sort, do not make those objections, for to what <lb/>
            purpose is it that they should be twice made? 49. Some­ <lb/>
            times, however, something like an answer to an objection may <lb/>
            be made, if anything be comprised in the depositions on the <lb/>
            part of the adversary be discussed in a private consultation of <lb/>
            advocates,! for we shall then reply to something said by the <lb/>
            opposite party and not to anything imagined by ourselves ; or <lb/>
            if the cause be of such a nature that we can state certain <lb/>
            objections besides which no others can be offered; as, for <lb/>
            example, when stolen goods are found in a house, he who is! <lb/>
            accused of having stolen them must, if he deny the charge, <lb/>
            necessarily say either that they were brought thither without his, <lb/>
            knowledge, or deposited with him, or given to him; to all which <lb/>
            allegations we may reply, even though they have not been <lb/>
            advanced. 50. In the schools, too, we may very properly <lb/>
            obviate objections,‡ so as to exercise ourselves for speaking in <note type="footnote"> * C. 52. </note><note type="footnote"> t Advocationibus.] By this word I understand private meetings of <lb/>
            the advocates. Spalding. " Patronorum et amicorum consultationes." <lb/>

            in which Spalding gives this passage. But the copies vary. Some of <lb/>
            the manuscripts have rectè et plenaribus contradictionibus. Turnebus </note> <pb n="392"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B V </note> <lb/>
            both places, the first and the second, on the side of the prose­ <lb/>
            cutor. Unless we do so, we shall never acquire practice in <lb/>
            combating objections, as we have no adversary to whom we are <lb/>
            called upon to reply.</p>
          <p>51. It is also a fault in a pleader to be too anxious, and to <lb/>
            labour at removing every thing that stands in his way; for <lb/>
            such solicitude excites distrust in the judge; and very fre­ <lb/>
            quently arguments, which, if stated off hand, would have re­ <lb/>
            moved all doubt, but which are tardily advanced through <lb/>
            excessive precaution, lose credit, because the advocate himself <lb/>
            seems to think something additional necessary to support <lb/>
            what he alleges. An orator, therefore, should carry confidence <lb/>
            in his manner, and speak as if he had the highest assurance <lb/>
            of the success of his cause, . 52. This quality, like all others <lb/>
            is eminently apparent in Cicero ; for his extraordinary affecta­ <lb/>
            tion of security is like security itself; and there is such autho­ <lb/>
            rity in his language as supplies the place of proof, so that we <lb/>
            do not venture to doubt his statements. But he who can per­ <lb/>
            ceive what is the strongest point in his adversary's case and <lb/>
            his own, will easily judge what arguments he will have to <lb/>
            oppose or to urge,</p>
          <p>53. As to order, there is no part of a cause in which it will <lb/>
            give us less trouble; for, if we are the prosecutors, we have <lb/>
            first to support our own allegations, and then to refute what is <lb/>
            brought against them; if we are defendants, we have to com­ <lb/>
            mence with refutation. 54. But from what we advance against <lb/>
            any objection there arise other objections, and sometimes to a <lb/>
            great extent; as the hands* of gladiators, which are called <note type="footnote"> and Burmann would therefore read recte et probationibus et contradic­ <lb/>
            tionibus, so that there may be two objects to which utrumque locum <lb/>
            may properly be referred. </note><note type="footnote"> * Gladiatorum manus.] This passage is almost wholly unintelligible <lb/>
            to us, from our want of knowledge of the gladiatorial movements to <lb/>
            which Quintilian refers. “ By comparing the passage," says Spalding, <lb/>
            “ with vi. 4, 8, ix. 1, 20, and passages of other authors, it is pretty <lb/>
            clear that manus is used for ictus, in conformity with the interpretation <lb/>
            of the old scholiast on Statius Theb. vi. 788; see also Lucan. vi. 190. <lb/>
            .... But the matter is obscure, as well in itself as in relation tc <lb/>
            that which is compared to it." " Nothing is more certain," says Bur­ <lb/>
            mann, “ than that manus primœ, secundœ, &amp;c., are modes of assault, in <lb/>
            which the gladiators were disciplined by the masters of the schools." <lb/>
            Capperonier refers to œquis manibus in Ammian. Marcell. xxi v. 4, 18, <lb/>
            which however affords little illustration. </note> <pb n="393"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.XIII. ] </note> <lb/>
            the second, become the third, if the first was intended to pro <lb/>
            yoke the assault of the adversary, and the fourth, if the chal­ <lb/>
            lenge be repeated, so as to make it necessary to stand on <lb/>
            guard twice and to attack twice; and this process may lead <lb/>
            still further.</p>
          <p>55. Refutation includes also that simple kind of proof of <lb/>
            which I have given an example above, * proceeding from the <lb/>
            feelings, and consisting in mere affirmation, such as that of <lb/>
            Scaurus, of which I have already spoken ;† and Iknow not <lb/>
            whether such sort of proof may not even be used more fre­ <lb/>
            quently when a denial is made. But the chief object of each <lb/>
            party must be to see where the main point lies; for it too <lb/>
            frequently happens in a cause that many points are disputed, <lb/>
            while judgment is to be passed on few.</p>
          <p>56. In these particulars consists the art of proving and re­ <lb/>
            futing ; but it requires to be supported and embellished by <lb/>
            thepowers of the speaker; for however well adapted our <lb/>
            arguments may be to establish our case, they will neverthe­ <lb/>
            less be but weak unless they are urged with extraordinary <lb/>
            vigour by him who uses them. 57. Those common-place observa­ <lb/>
            tions, accordingly, concerning witnesses, written evidence, argu <lb/>
            ments, and other matters of the kind, produce great impression <lb/>
            on the minds of the judges ; as well as those peculiarly arising <lb/>
            from the cause, in which we praise or blame any action, show <lb/>
            that it is just or unjust, or make it appear greater or less, worse <lb/>
            or better, than it really is. Of these some are useful in the <lb/>
            comparison of one argument with another, others in the com­ <lb/>
            parison of several, others in influencing the decision of a whole <lb/>
            cause. 58. Some, too, serve to prepare the mind of the <lb/>
            judge, others to confirm it in the opinions which he has <lb/>
            already formed ;and such preparation or confirmation has <lb/>
            reference sometimes to particular heads, and may be offered <lb/>
            as may be suitable for each. 59. I wonder, therefore, that it <lb/>
            should have been disputed, and with no small acrimony, <lb/>
            between two leaders of opposite sects as it were, whether argu­ <lb/>
            ments from moral considerations should accompany each parti­ <lb/>
            cular head, as Theodorus would have it, or whether the judge <lb/>
            should be informed before his feelings are excited, as Apollo­ <lb/>
            dorus directs; as if no middle course could be pursued, and <note type="footnote"> * C. 12, sect 12. </note><note type="footnote"> t C. 12, sect. 10 </note> <pb n="394"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V </note> <lb/>
            as if nothing could be ordered to suit the interests of the <lb/>
            cause. But it is men who do not speak in the forum them­ <lb/>
            selves that give these directions ; and their systems of rules, <lb/>
            which they have composed at leisure and at ease, are dis­ <lb/>
            turbed by the necessary confusion of battle. 60. For almost <lb/>
            all authors, who have set forth methods of speaking, as a kind <lb/>
            of mysteries,. have bound us not only to certain subjects for <lb/>
            our arguments, but by fixed laws as to the form of expressing <lb/>
            them. But having offered these few remarks on this head, I <lb/>
            shall not shrink from communicating what I myself think <lb/>
            about it, that is, what I observe to have been the practice of <lb/>
            the most eminent orators.</p>

            parts, 6—9. Not always of the same form, 10 -13. The epi­ <lb/>
            cheirema of the orators is the syllogism of the philosophers, 14- <lb/>

            How the enthymeme differs from the syllogism, 24—26. We must <lb/>
            not crowd our speech with rhetorical forms of argument, 27—32. <lb/>
            We must not leave our arguments unembellished, 33—35.</p>
          <p>1. THE term enthymeme rhetoricians apply not only to the <lb/>
            argument itself, that is the matter which is used for the proof <lb/>
            of any thing else, but to the enunciation of the argument, <lb/>
            which they make, as I said,! twofold ; one from consequent.. <lb/>
            which consists of a proposition and a proof immediately fol­ <lb/>
            lowing it; as in this passage of Cicero's speech for Lijarius :‡ <lb/>
            The cause was then doubtful, because there was something that <lb/>
            might be sustained on each side; but now that side must be <lb/>
            deemed the stronger to which even the gods have given support ; <lb/>
            this is an enthymeme, for it contains a proposition and a <lb/>
            reason, but no logical conclusion, and is therefore an imper­ <lb/>
            feet syllogism; 2. the other from opposites, which some call <note type="footnote"> * Burmann compares Cic. de Orat. i. 47 : Explicet nobis, et ille <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. XIV.] </note> <lb/>
            tne only form of enthymeme,* and in which the proof is much <lb/>
            stronger. Such is that in the speech of Cicero for Milo :t You <lb/>
            sit therefore as avengers of the death of a man to whom you would <lb/>
            be unwilling to restore life even if you thought it could be restored <lb/>
            by your means. 8. This form is sometimes made to consist <lb/>
            of several clauses, of which we have an example by the same <lb/>
            orator on behalf of the same client: Him, therefore, whom he <lb/>
            would not kill to the satisfaction of all, was he willing to kill to <lb/>
            the dissatisfaction of some ? Him, whom he did not dare to kill <lb/>
            with the sanction of the lac, in a favourable place, at a favour­ <lb/>
            able time, and with impunity, did he boldly resolve to kill un­ <lb/>
            justly, in an unfavourableplace, at an unfavourable time, and at <lb/>
            the hazard of his own life ? 4. But the best kind of enthymeme <lb/>
            appears to be that in which a reason is subjoined to a proposi­ <lb/>
            tion dissimilar or opposite, as in this passage of Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes For. if acts have at times been committed against the <lb/>
            laws, and you have imitated them, it does not follow that you <lb/>
            should therefore escape punishment, but much rather that you <lb/>
            should be condemned ; for if any of the violators of laws had <lb/>
            been condemned, you would not have written this, and, if you <lb/>
            are condemned, no other will write anything similar.</p>
          <p>5. Of the epicheirema § four, five, and even six parts are <lb/>
            made by some rhetoricians; Cicero || makes at most five; the <lb/>
            proposition, or major, with its reason; the assumption, or <lb/>
            minor, with its proof; and, as the fifth, the conclusion; but <lb/>
            as the major has sometimes no need of a reason, and the <lb/>
            minor no need of proof, and as there is sometimes, too, no <lb/>
            need of a conclusion, he thinks that the epicheirema may at <lb/>
            times consist of only four, or three, or even two parts. 6. To <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>* See c. 10, sect. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t C. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ In Androtionem, p.

            clusion. That which is the subject of inquiry is comprehended in the <lb/>

            minor. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> ∥ Do Inv. i, 37 ; Script, act Hereon, ii. 18. </note> <pb n="396"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V </note> <lb/>
            me as well as to the greater number of authors, there appears <lb/>
            to be not more than three; for such is the nature of reasoning, <lb/>
            that there must be something about which there is a question, <lb/>
            and something by which it is to be proved ;and a third may <lb/>
            be added as resulting from the agreement of the two former. <lb/>
            Thus there will be first the proposition, or major; secondly, <lb/>
            the assumption, or minor; and thirdly, the conclusion; for the <lb/>
            reason of the first part and the proof of the second may be in­ <lb/>
            cluded in those parts to which they are attached. 7. Let us take, <lb/>
            accordingly, an example of the five parts from Cicero :* Those <lb/>
            things are better managed which are regulated by some plan <lb/>
            than those which are conducted without any fixed design; <lb/>
            " this," says Cicero, “ they call the first part, and think that <lb/>
            it ought to be established with various reasons and the most <lb/>
            copious eloquence possible." For myself, I consider the whole <lb/>
            proposition with its reasons as but one part else, if the rea­ <lb/>
            soning be called a part, and that reasoning be various, there <lb/>
            must necessarily be various parts. 8. He then gives the <lb/>
            assumption, or minor: But of all things nothing is managed, <lb/>
            better than the whole world; “and," he adds, "of this assump­ <lb/>
            tion they introduce its proof as a fourth part;" but I say the <lb/>
            same concerning the assumption as concerning the proposition. <lb/>
            9. " In the fifth place," he continues, “ they place the conclu­ <lb/>
            sion, which either infers that only which necessarily results <lb/>
            from all the preceding parts, as, Therefore the world is regu­ <lb/>
            lated by some plan; or, after briefly bringing together the <lb/>
            proposition and assumption, adds what is collected from them, <lb/>
            as, But if those things are better managed which are regulated <lb/>
            by a plan than those which are conducted without a plan, and <lb/>
            if of all things nothing is managed better than the whole world, <lb/>
            it follows therefore that the world is regulated by a plan." A <lb/>
            third part I accordingly admit.</p>
          <p>10. In the three parts, however, which I have made, there <lb/>
            is not always the same form. There is ONE FORM in which <lb/>
            the same is expressed in the conclusion as in the major propo­ <lb/>
            sition : The soul is immortal, for whatever has its motion from <lb/>
            itself, is immortal: But the soul has its motion from itself : <lb/>
            Therefore the soul is immortal. This form prevails not only in <lb/>
            detached arguments, but throughout all causes, such at least <note type="footnote"> * De lnv. L 34. </note> <pb n="397"/>
            <note type="margin"> on. XIV.] </note> <lb/>
            as are simple, and in the various questions in causes.* 11. For <lb/>
            all causes and all questions have a first proposition: as, You <lb/>
            have committed sacrilege; and, It is not every one that has killed <lb/>
            a man that is guilty of murder: and attached to this a propo­ <lb/>
            sition, a reason, (which, however, is more expanded in causes <lb/>
            and portions of causes than in detached arguments,) and, <lb/>
            lastly, a conclusion, in which they commonly show, either by a <lb/>
            full enumeration of particulars, or a short recapitulation, what <lb/>
            they have established. In this kind of epicheirema the pro­ <lb/>
            position is doubtful, for it is about the proposition that the <lb/>
            question is. 12. In ANOTHER FORM the conclusion is not indeed <lb/>
            the same as the major proposition, but has the same force: <lb/>
            Death is nothing to us, for what is dissolved into its elements, is <lb/>
            without consciousness; and that which is without consciousness <lb/>
            is nothing to is. In a THIRD FORM the proposition is not the <lb/>
            same as the conclusion: All animated things are better than <lb/>
            things inanimate: But nothing is better than the world: The <lb/>
            world therefore is animated. What is here the conclusion <lb/>
            might be made the major proposition;t for the reasoning <lb/>
            might be stated thus: The world is animated, for all animated <lb/>
            things are better than things inanimate ‡ 13. But this major <lb/>
            proposition is either an acknowledged truth as in the last <lb/>
            example, or requires proof, as, He who wishes to lead a happy <lb/>
            life, ought to become a philosopher; this is not universally <lb/>
            admitted; and the conclusion cannot be drawn unless the <lb/>
            premises be established. The minor proposition, too, is <lb/>
            sometimes universally acknowledged, as, But all wish to live a <lb/>
            happy life, and sometimes requires to be proved, as, What is <lb/>
            dissolved into its elements is void of consciousness, for it is <lb/>
            uncertain whether the soul, when detached from the body, may <lb/>
            not be immortal, or exist at least for a certain time. I may <lb/>
            observe that what some call the assumption, or minor proposi­ <lb/>
            tion, others call the reason.</p>
          <p>14. But the epicheirema differs in no respect from the <note type="footnote"> * In quœstionibus.] Quœationes are to be distinguished from the <lb/>
            causa universa ; see iii. 6, 9, 10. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t All editions have Hie potest videri de re contentio ; but as no good <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B V. </note> <lb/>
            syllogism, except that the syllogism has a greater number at <lb/>
            forms, and infers truth from truth; while the epicheirema is <lb/>
            generally employed about probabilities ;for if it were always <lb/>
            possible to prove what isDisputed by what is acknowledged, <lb/>
            there would scarcely be any work for the orator in the matter; <lb/>
            since what need would there be of superior ability to reason <lb/>
            thus: 15. The property belongs to me, for I am the only son <lb/>
            of the deceased, or, I am the sole heir, since by the laws respect­ <lb/>
            ing property the property of a testator is given to the heir <lb/>
            according to the purport of the will; and to me therefore the <lb/>
            property belongs. 16. But when the reason given becomes <lb/>
            itself a matter of dispute, we must render that certain by <lb/>
            which we seek to prove what is uncertain; for instance, if it <lb/>
            be said by the adversary, You are not his son, or, You are not <lb/>
            legitimate, or, You are not the only son, or, again, You are not <lb/>
            the heir, or, The wiU is not valid, or, You are not capable of <lb/>
            inheriting, or, You have co-heirs, we must establish a just <lb/>
            ground on which the property ought to be adjudged to us. <lb/>
            17. But when a long chain of reasoning intervenes, a recapi­ <lb/>
            tulatory conclusion is requisite. In other cases, a proposition <lb/>
            and reason may often be sufficient :* The laws are silent amidst <lb/>
            arms, and do not require their sanction to be waited for, when <lb/>
            he who would wait for it must suffer an unjust death before a <lb/>
            just penalty could be exacted. Hence it has been observed <lb/>
            that the form of enthymeme which rests upon consequents is <lb/>
            similar to a reason. Sometimes, again, a single proposition is <lb/>
            judiciously given alone, without any reason, as that which we <lb/>
            just now cited, The laws are silent amidst arms. 18. We <lb/>
            may also commence with the reason, and then draw a conclu­ <lb/>
            sion, as, in the same speech, But if the twelve tables allow a <lb/>
            thief to be killed with impunity under any circumstances, and <lb/>
            a thief in the day if he defend himself with a weapon, who can <lb/>
            suppose that in whatever case a man has been killed, he who <lb/>
            killed him must suffer punishment? Cicero has also made <lb/>
            some variation in this form, and put the reason in the third <lb/>
            place : When he sees that the sword is sometimes put into our <lb/>
            hands by the laws themselves. 19. The following sentence, <lb/>
            again, takes the form of that which precedes: But how can <lb/>
            death be unjustly inflicted on a lier-in-wait and a robber? This <lb/>
            is the proposition. What is the object of OUT escorts, of our <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>* Cic. Pro Mil. a. 4. </note> <pb n="399"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.XIV.] </note> <lb/>
            weapons ? This is the reason. Which certainly we should not <lb/>
            be allowed to have, if we were under no circumstances to make <lb/>
            use of them. This is a conclusion from the proposition and <lb/>
            the reason.</p>
          <p>SO. This mode of argument is refuted in three ways; that <lb/>
            is, it is attacked in each of its parts; for the proposition may <lb/>
            be combated, or the assumption, or the conclusion, or some­ <lb/>
            times all the three. For example, the proposition that He is <lb/>
            justly killed who lies in wait to kill, may be combated, for the <lb/>
            first question in the defence of Milo is, Whether he should be <lb/>
            allowed to live who confesses that a man has been killed by his <lb/>
            hand ? 21. The assumption, or minor proposition, may be <lb/>
            assailed by all the arts which I have mentioned in the chapter <lb/>
            on refutation.* As to the reason, we may observe that it is <lb/>
            sometimes true when the proposition to which it is attached <lb/>
            is false; and that a false reason is sometimes attached to a <lb/>
            true proposition. Virtue is a good, is a true proposition; but <lb/>
            if any one add as a reason, because it makes men rich, a false <lb/>
            reason is given for a true proposition. 22. As to the conclu­ <lb/>
            sion, it is either denied to be just when it expresses something <lb/>
            different from what can be fairly deduced from the premises, <lb/>
            or is alleged to have nothing to do with the question: A lier- <lb/>
            in-wait is justly put to death, for he who prepared himself to <lb/>
            offer violence as an enemy, ought also to be repelled as an <lb/>
            enemy; Clodius, therefore, as an enemy, was justly put to <lb/>
            death: here the conclusion is false, for it has not yet been <lb/>
            proved that Clodius was a lier-in wait. 23. On the other hand, <lb/>
            it would be a just conclusion to say, A lier-in-wait, therefore, as <lb/>
            an enemy, was justly put to death, but it would be nothing to <lb/>
            the purpose; for it had not previously been proved that <lb/>
            Clodius was a lier-in-wait. But though the proposition and <lb/>
            reason may be true, and the conclusion false, yet if the <lb/>
            proposition and reason are false, the conclusion cannot be <lb/>
            true.</p>
          <p>24. The enthymeme is called by some an oratorical syllogism, <lb/>
            by others a part of a syllogism, because the syllogism has <lb/>
            always its regular proposition and conclusion, and establishes <lb/>
            by means of all its parts that which it has proposed; while <lb/>
            the enthymeme is satisfied if merely what is stated in it be <lb/>
            understood. 25, A syllogism is of this form: Virtue is the only <note type="footnote"> * C. 13 of this book. </note> <pb n="400"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B V </note> <lb/>
            good, for that only is good of which none can make an ill use: <lb/>
            But none can make an ill use of virtue: Therefore virtue is <lb/>
            the only good: the enthymeme will consist only of the conse­ <lb/>
            quents, Virtue is a good, because none can make an ill use of <lb/>
            it. negative syllogism will be of this nature: Money is not <lb/>
            a good, for that is not a good of which any one can make a bad <lb/>
            use: But any one can make a bad use of money: Therefore <lb/>
            money is not a good: here the enthymeme will consist of the <lb/>
            opposites :* Is money a good, when any one can make a bad <lb/>
            use of it ? 26. The following sentence has the syllogistic <lb/>
            form : If money, which consists of coined silver, comes under <lb/>
            the general term silver, he that bequeathed all his silver <lb/>
            bequeathed also his money consisting in coined silver: But he <lb/>
            did bequeath all his silver: Therefore he bequeathed also his <lb/>
            money consisting of silver; but for an orator it is sufficient to <lb/>
            say, When he bequeathed all his silver, he bequeathed also his <lb/>
            money which consists of silver.</p>
          <p>27.I think that I have now gone through the mysteries! <lb/>
            of those who deliver precepts on rhetoric. But judgment <lb/>
            must be exercised in applying such directions as I have given. <lb/>
            For though I do not think it unlawful to use syllogisms occa­ <lb/>
            sionally in a speech, yet I should by no means like it to con­ <lb/>
            sist wholly of syllogisms, or to be crowded with a mass of <lb/>
            epicheiremata and enthymemes, for it would then resemble the <lb/>
            dialogues and disputations of logicians, rather than oratorical <lb/>
            pleading; and the two differ widely from one another. <lb/>
            28. Your men of learning, who are seeking for truth amongst <lb/>
            men of learning, examine every point with the utmost minute­ <lb/>
            ness and scrupulosity, with the view of bringing it to clearness <lb/>
            and certainty, claiming to themselves the offices of discovering <lb/>
            and judging what is right, of which they call the one <foreign xml:lang="grc">τΟπιϰή</foreign>, <lb/>
            “ the art of finding arguments," and the other <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰϱιτιϰή</foreign>, " the <lb/>
            power of judging of their soundness;” 29. but we orators <lb/>
            must compose our speeches to suit the judgment of others, <lb/>
            and must frequently speak before people altogether uneducated, <lb/>
            or at least ignorant of any other literature than what we teach <lb/>
            them, and unless we allure them by gratification, attract them <lb/>
            force, and occasionally excite their feelings, we shall never <note type="footnote"> * An bonum est pecunia, &amp;c.] Spalding dislikes the abrupt interro­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH.XIV.J </note> <lb/>
            impress upon them what is just and true. 30. Qratory should <lb/>
            be and brilliant; but it will have neither of those quali­ <lb/>
            ties, if it be pieced out of regular and frequent syllogisms, <lb/>
            expressed almost always in the same form, for it will then incur <lb/>
            contempt from appearing mean, and aversion from looking <lb/>
            servile; if it is copious, it will excite satiety; if it attempts to be <lb/>
            swelling, it will meet disdain .31. Let it hold its course. <lb/>
            therefore, not along foot-paths, but through open fields; let it <lb/>
            not be like subterranean springs confined in narrow channels, <lb/>
            but flow like broad rivers through whole valleys, forcing a way <lb/>
            wherever it does not find one. For what is a greater misery <lb/>
            to speakers than to be slaves to certain rules, like children <lb/>
            imitating copies set them, and, as the Greeks proverbially <lb/>
            express it, taking constant care of the coat which their mother <lb/>
            has given them ?* 32. Must there always be proposition and <lb/>
            conclusion, from consequents and opposites ? Is the speaker <lb/>
            not to animate his reasoning, to amplify it, to vary and diver­ <lb/>
            sify it with a thousand figures, making his language appear,to <lb/>
            grow and spring forth naturally, and not to be manufactured, <lb/>
            locking suspicious from its art,t and showing everywhere the <lb/>
            fashioning of the master? What true orator has ever spoken <lb/>
            in such a way ? In Demosthenes himself are not the traces to <lb/>
            be found of such regularity and art very few ? Yet the Greeks <lb/>
            of our own day (the only respect in which they act less judi­ <lb/>
            ciously than ourselves) bind their thoughts as it were in chains, <lb/>
            connecting them in an inexplicable series, proving what is <lb/>
            undisputed, confirming what is admitted, and calling them­ <lb/>
            selves, in these points, imitators of the ancients; but if they <lb/>
            are asked whom they imitate, they will never give an answer.</p>
          <p>33. Of figures I shall speak in another place. ‡ At present, <lb/>
            it seems necessary only to add, that I do not agree with those <lb/>
            who think that arguments are always to be expressed in a <lb/>
            pure, lucid, and precise style, but neither copious nor ornate. <lb/>
            That they should be precise and perspicuous indeed, I admit, <lb/>

            no obscurity. 34. For a metaphor often throws a flood of <lb/>

            litus, “ the sea-shore,” the part where the wave eludit, <lb/>

            the more we must recommend it by charms of expression; <lb/>
            argument is less suspected when it is disguised and to please <lb/>
            the hearer contributes greatly to convince him. Otherwise we <lb/>
            must pronounce Cicero deserving of censure, for using, in the <lb/>
            heat of his argumentation, the metaphorical expressions, The <lb/>
            laws are silent amid arms, and, The sword is sometimes pre­ <lb/>
            sented to us by the laws themselves. But moderation must <lb/>
            be observed in the use of such figures, that, while they are an <lb/>

            to it. <note type="footnote"> * See Cic. Topic. c. 7. " Aquillius, when there was any discus­ <lb/>

          <p>Quintilian laments that his son, whose improvement, in conjunction withe <lb/>
            that of the sons of Marcellus and Caesar, he had had in view in <lb/>
            the composition of this work, had been carried off by death, § 1, <lb/>
            2. He had previously lost, during the composition of another <lb/>
            work, a younger son, as well as his wife, 3—6. Abilities of which <lb/>
            his children gave indications, 7—9. His grief; he intreats <lb/>
            indulgence if, in consequence of it, he pursues his work with less <lb/>
            spirit, 10—16.</p>
          <p>1. HAVING entered upon this undertaking, Marcellus Victor, <lb/>
            principally at your request,- but with a desire, at the same <lb/>
            time, that some profit to well-disposed youth might arise <lb/>
            from my labours, I have applied to it recently with great dili­ <lb/>
            gence, from the necessity, almost, of the office conferred <lb/>
            upon me,† yet with a regard also to my own gratification, <lb/>
            thinking that I should leave this work to my son, whose <lb/>
            remarkable ability deserved even the most anxious attention <lb/>
            of a father, as the best portion of his inheritance, so that if <lb/>
            the fates should cut me off before him, as would have been <lb/>
            but just and desirable, he might still have his fathers pre­ <lb/>
            cepts to guide him. 2. But while I was pursuing my design <lb/>
            day and night, and hastening the completion of it, through <lb/>
            fear of being prevented by death, fortune sent so sudden an <lb/>
            affliction upon me, that the result ( <unclear/> y industry interests no <lb/>
            one less than myself, for I have lost by a second severe <lb/>
            bereavement that son, of whom I had conceiveu the highest <lb/>
            expectations; and in whom I reposed my only hopes for the <lb/>
            solace of my age.‡ 3. What shall I now do ? Or what further <lb/>
            use can I suppose that there is for me upon the earth, when <lb/>
            the gods thus animadvert upon me ? When I had just begun <lb/>
            to write the book which I have published, On the Causes of <lb/>
            the Corruption of Eloquence,§ it happened that I was struck <note type="footnote"># See the Preface to the work, sect. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> + See the Introduction to b. iv. sect. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ He means the loss of his son, at the age of ten years.

            with a similar blow. It would have been best for me, there­ <lb/>
            fore, to have thrown that inauspicious work, and whatever ill­ <lb/>
            omened learning there is in me, into the flames of that pre­ <lb/>
            mature funeral pile which was to consume what I loved, and <lb/>
            not to have wearied my unnatural prolongation of life with <lb/>
            new and additional anxieties. 4. What parent, of right feel­ <lb/>
            ings at least, would pardon me, if I could pursue my studies <lb/>
            with my accustomed diligence, and would not hate my insen­ <lb/>
            sibility, if I had any other use for my voice than to accuse the <lb/>
            gods for causing me to survive all my children, and to testify <lb/>
            that divine providence pays no regard to terrestrial affairs ?* <lb/>
            If such neglect of the gods is not visible in my own person, <lb/>
            to whom nothing can be objected but that I am still alive, it <lb/>
            is certainly manifest in the fate of those whom cruel death <lb/>
            has condemned to perish so undeservedly, their mother having <lb/>
            been previously snatched from me, who, after giving birth to <lb/>
            a second son, before she had completed her nineteenth year, <lb/>
            died, though cut off prematurely, a happy † death. 5. By that <lb/>
            one calamity I was so deeply afflicted, that no good fortune <lb/>
            could ever afterwards render me completely happy; for, ex­ <lb/>
            hibiting every virtue that can grace a woman, she not only <lb/>
            caused incurable grief to her husband, but, being of so girlish <lb/>
            an age, especially when compared with my own, her loss <lb/>
            might be counted even as that of a daughter. 6. I consoled <lb/>
            myself, however, with my surviving children; and she, know­ <lb/>
            ing, what was contrary to the order of nature, though she her­ <lb/>
            self desired it, that I should be left alive, escaped the greatest <lb/>
            of pangs in her untimely death.‡ My younger son dying, <lb/>
            first of the two, when he had just passed his fifth year, took <lb/>
            from me, as it were, the sight of one of my eyes. 7. I am not <lb/>
            ostentatious of my misfortunes, nor desirous to exaggerate the <lb/>
            causes which I have for tears ; on the contrary, I wish that I <note type="footnote"> * A common mistake among the ancients, who, when misfortune <lb/>

            sweetness in his expressions, what nascent fire in his under <lb/>
            standing, and what substantial tokens he gave, (such as I <lb/>
            know are scarcely credible in one so young,) not only of calm <lb/>
            but of deep thought? LSuch a child, even if he had been the <lb/>
            son of a stranger, would have won my love] 8. It was the <lb/>
            will, too, of insidious fortune, with a view to torture me the more <lb/>
            severely, that he should show more affection for me than for <lb/>
            any one else, that he should prefer me to his nurses, to his <lb/>
            grandmother who was educating him, and to all such as gain <lb/>
            the love of children of that age. I, therefore, feel indebted to <lb/>
            that grief which I experienced a few months before for the <lb/>
            loss of his excellent mother, whose character is beyond all <lb/>
            praise, for I have less reason to mourn on my own, than to <lb/>
            rejoice on her account.</p>
          <p>9. I then rested for my only hope and pleasure on my younger <lb/>
            son, my little Quintilian,and he might have sufficed to console <lb/>
            me, for he did not put forth merely flowers, like the other, but, <lb/>
            having entered his tenth year, certain and well-formed fruits. <lb/>
            10. I swear by my own sufferings, by the sorrowful testimony <lb/>
            of my feelings, by his own shade, the deity that my grief <lb/>
            worships, that I discerned in him such excellences of mind, (not <lb/>
            in receiving instruction only, for which, in a long course of <lb/>
            experience, I have seen no child more remarkable, or in <lb/>
            steady application, requiring, even at that age, as his teachers <lb/>
            know, no compulsion, but in indications of honourable, pious. <lb/>
            humane, and generous feelings,) that the dread of such a thuD <lb/>
            der-stroke might have been felt even from that cause, as it has <lb/>
            been generally observed, that precocious maturity is most <lb/>
            liable to early death, and that there reigns some malignant <lb/>
            influence to destroy our fairest hopes, in order that our enjoy­ <lb/>
            ments may not be exalted beyond what is appointed to man. <lb/>
            11. He had also every adventitious advantage, agreeableness <lb/>
            and clearness of voice, sweetness of tone, and a peculiar <lb/>
            facility in sounding every letter in either language, -as if he <lb/>
            had been born to speak that only. But these were still only <lb/>
            promising appearances ; he had greater qualities, fortitude, <lb/>
            resolution, and strength to resist pain and fear; for with what <lb/>
            courage, with what admiration on the part of his physicians, <lb/>
            did he endure an illness of eight months! How did he con- <pb n="406"/>

            sole me at the last! How, when lie was losing his senses, <lb/>
            and unable to recognize me, did he fix his thoughts in de­ <lb/>
            lirium only on learning! 12. 0 disappointment of my hopes! <lb/>
            Did I endure, my son, to contemplate your eyes sinking in <lb/>
            death, and your breath taking its flight? Could I, after em­ <lb/>
            bracing your cold and lifeless body, and receiving your last <lb/>
            breath, breathe again the common air? Justly do I deserve <lb/>
            the affliction which I endure, and the thoughts which affect <lb/>
            me! 13. Have I, your parent, lost you, when just raised, by <lb/>
            being adopted by a man* of consular dignity, to the hopes of <lb/>
            enjoying all the honours of your father ;t you, who were des­ <lb/>
            tined to be son-in-law to the prætor, your maternal uncle; you <lb/>
            who, in the opinion of all, were a candidate for the highest <lb/>
            distinctions of Attic eloquence, surviving myself only to grieve ? <lb/>
            May my sufferings at least, if not my obstinate clinging to life, <lb/>
            make atonement to you during the rest of my existence ! We <lb/>
            in vain impute all our ills to the injustice of fortune, for no <lb/>
            man grieves long but through his own fault.: 14. But I still <lb/>
            live, and some occupation for life must be sought, and I must <lb/>
            put faith in the learned, who have pronounced letters the only <lb/>
            consolation in adversity.</p>
          <p>If the present violence of my grief, however, should in time <lb/>
            subside, so that some other thought may be admitted among <lb/>
            so many sorrowful reflections, I shall not unreasonably crave <lb/>
            pardon for the delay in my work; for who can wonder that <lb/>
            my studies were interrupted, when it must rather appear won­ <lb/>
            derful that they were not relinquished entirely? 15. Should <lb/>
            anything, then, in this part of my work, appear less finished than <lb/>
            that which I commenced when less oppressed with affliction, <lb/>
            let it be excused on account of the rigorousness of fortune, <lb/>
            who, if she has not extinguished the moderate power of mind <lb/>
            : which I previously possessed, has at least succeeded in weak­ <lb/>
            ening it. But let me, on this very account, rouse myself to <lb/>
            Action with the greater spirit, since, though it is difficult for <lb/>
            me to bear her oppression, it is easy for me to despise it, for <lb/>

            the exordium and the peroration have in common, and in what <lb/>
            respects they differ, 10—14. The accuser excites the feelings <lb/>
            either by showing the heinousness of the charge which he makes, <lb/>
            or the pitiable condition of the party for whom he seeks redress, <lb/>

            should not be long, 23—28. Modes of exciting pity, 29—36. <lb/>
            How persons who are introduced to move pity at the conclusion <lb/>
            of a speech, should behave themselves, 37—43. No orator must <lb/>
            attempt to draw tears from. the judges unless he be a man ot <lb/>
            great ability, 44, 45. It is the part of the peroration to dispel <lb/>
            compassionate emotions, as well as to excite them, 46—49. Pero­ <lb/>
            rations sometimes of a very mild character, 50. Appeals to the <lb/>
            feelings may be made in other parts of a speech as well as in the <lb/>
            peroration, 51-55.</p>
          <p>1. WHAT was to follow,* was the peroration, which some <lb/>
            have termed the completion, and others the conclusion. There <lb/>
            are two species of it, the one comprising the substance of the <lb/>
            speech, and the other adapted to excite the feelings.</p>
          <p>The repetition and summing-up of heads, which is called <lb/>
            by the Greeks '<foreign xml:lang="grc">αναϰεϕαλαίωσις</foreign> and by some of the Latins <lb/>
            enumeration, is intended both to refresh the memory of the <lb/>
            judge, to set the whole cause at once before his view, and to <lb/>
            enforce such arguments in a body as had produced an in­ <lb/>
            sufficient effect in detail. 2. In this part of our speech, <note type="footnote"> * When the progress of the work was interrupted by the death of <lb/>
            his Ion. </note> <pb n="408"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.VI </note> <lb/>
            what we repeat ought to be repeated as briefly as possible, <lb/>
            and we must, as is intimated by the Greek term, run over <lb/>
            only the principal heads; for, if we dwell upon them, the <lb/>
            result will be, not a recapitulation, but a sort of second <lb/>
            speech. What we may think necessary to recapitulate, must <lb/>
            be put forward with some emphasis, enlivened by suitable <lb/>
            remarks, and varied with different figures, for nothing is more <lb/>
            offensive than mere straightforward repetition, as if the <lb/>
            speaker distrusted the judge's memory.* The figures which <lb/>
            we may employ are innumerable; and Cicero affords us an <lb/>
            excellent example in his pleading against Verres, 3. If your <lb/>
            father himself were your judge, what would he say when these <lb/>
            things were proved against you? where he subjoins an <lb/>
            enumeration of particulars; and there is another instance, in <lb/>
            which the same orator, in the same speech, enumerates, on <lb/>
            invoking the gods, all the temples spoiled by Verres in his <lb/>
            prœtorship. We may also sometimes affect to doubt whether <lb/>
            something has not escaped us, and to wonder what our <lb/>
            opponents will reply to such or such a point, or what hope the <lb/>
            accuser can have when our case is so fully established. 4. <lb/>
            But what affords us the greatest gratification, is the opportunity <lb/>
            of drawing some argument from the speech of our adversary, <lb/>
            as when we say, He has omitted this point in the cause; or, <lb/>
            He made it his object to oppress us with odium; or, He had <lb/>
            recourse to entreaty, and not without reason, when he knew so <lb/>
            and so. 5. But I must not go through such figures of speech, <lb/>
            severally, lest those which I may now notice should be thought <lb/>
            the only ones that can be used; since opportunities for vary­ <lb/>
            ing our forms of speech spring from the nature of particular <lb/>
            causes, from the remarks of the adversary, and even from <lb/>
            fortuitous circumstances. Nor must we recapitulate only the <lb/>
            points of our own case, but call also upon our opponent to <lb/>
            reply to certain questions. 6. But this can only be done <lb/>
            when there is time for further speaking, and when we have <lb/>
            advanced what cannot be refuted ; for to challenge the adver­ <lb/>
            sary on facts which make strongly for him, is to be, not his <lb/>
            opponent, but his prompter.</p>
          <p>7. This has been thought by most of the Attic orators, and <lb/>
            by almost all the philosophers, who have left anything written <lb/>
            on the art of oratory, the only legitimate kind of peroration; <note type="footnote"> * L. V. c. 52. </note> <pb n="409"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            a tenet which the Attic orators adopted, I suppose, for this <lb/>
            reason, that at Athens an orator was prohibited even by an <lb/>
            officer of the court from attempting to excite the feelings. At <lb/>
            the philosophers I am less surprised, since with them all <lb/>
            excitement of the feelings is accounted vicious; nor is it <lb/>
            consistent with morality, in their opinion, that the judge <lb/>
            should be thus diverted from truth, or becoming a good man <lb/>
            to use vicious means. Yet they will allow that to move the <lb/>
            feelings is justifiable,* if what is true, and just, and sub­ <lb/>
            servient to the public good, cannot be established by any <lb/>
            other method. 8. It is admitted however among all orators <lb/>
            that a recapitulation may be made with advantage even in <lb/>
            other parts of a pleading, if the cause be complex and require <lb/>
            to be supported by numerous arguments; while nobody doubts, <lb/>
            on the other hand, that there are many short and simple <lb/>
            causes in which recapitulation is by no means necessary. <lb/>
            This part of the peroration is common alike both to the <lb/>
            prosecutor and the defendant.</p>
          <p>9. Both of them also have recourse to the excitement of <lb/>
            the feelings; but the defendant more rarely, the prosecutor <lb/>
            more frequently and with greater earnestness ; for the prose­ <lb/>
            cutor has to rouse the judge, while the defendant's business is <lb/>
            to soothe him. But the prosecutor at times produces tears <lb/>
            from the pity which he expresses for the matter for which he <lb/>
            seeks redress; and the defendant sometimes inveighs with <lb/>
            great vehemence at the injustice of the calumny or conspiracy <lb/>
            of which he is the object.! It is therefore most convenient <lb/>
            to divide these duties,+ which are for the most part similarly <lb/>
            introduced, as I said,§ in the exordium, but are in the pero­ <lb/>
            ration more free and full. 10. A feeling of the judge in our <lb/>
            ravour is sought but modestly at the commencement, when it <lb/>
            s sufficient that it be just admitted, and when the whole <lb/>
            speech is before us; but in the peroration we have to mark <lb/>
            with what sort of feeling the judge will proceed to consider <lb/>
            . his sentence, as we have then nothing more to say, and no <lb/>
            place is left us for which we can reserve further arguments. <note type="footnote"> * Comp. v. 14, 29. </note><note type="footnote"> t We must, as Spalding observes, read calwrnnice et conspirationis <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            11. It is therefore common to each party to endeavour to <lb/>
            attract the favour of the judge towards himself, to withdraw it <lb/>
            from his adversary, to excite the feelings and to compose them ; <lb/>
            and this very brief admonition may be given to both parties, <lb/>
            that a pleader should bring the whole force of his cause before <lb/>
            his view, and, when he has noticed what, among its various <lb/>
            points, is likely, or may be made likely, to excite disapproba­ <lb/>
            tion or favour, dislike or pity, should dwell on those par­ <lb/>
            ticulars by which he himself, if he were judge, would be most <lb/>
            impressed. 12. But it is safer for me to consider the parts <lb/>
            of each separately.</p>
          <p>What recommends the prosecutor to the judge, I have <lb/>
            already noticed. in the precepts which I have given for the <lb/>
            exordium. Some particulars, however, which it is sufficient <lb/>
            to intimate in the commencement, must be stated more fully t <lb/>
            in the conclusion, especially if the cause be undertaken against <lb/>
            a violent, odious, or dangerous character, or if the condemna­ <lb/>
            tion of the accused will be an honour to the judges, and his <lb/>
            acquittal a disgrace to them. 13. Thus Calvus+ makes an <lb/>
            admirable remark in his speech against Vatinius, You know, <lb/>
            judges, that bribery has been committed, and all men know that <lb/>
            you know it. Cicero, too, in pleading against Verres,§ observes <lb/>
            that the disrepute which had fallen on the courts might be <lb/>
            effaced by the condemnation of Verres; and this is one of the <lb/>
            conciliatory modes of address to which I have before alluded. <lb/>
            If intimidation, too, is to be used, in order to produce a <lb/>
            similar effect, || it has a more forcible position here than in the <lb/>
            exordium. What my opinion is on this point, I have already <lb/>
            stated in another book,¶ 14. It is possible also to excite jeal­ <lb/>
            ousy, hatred, or indignation, more freely in the peroration than <lb/>
            elsewhere; in regard to which feelings, the influence of the <lb/>
            accused contributes to excite jealousy, ill-reputation hatred, aud <lb/>
            disrespect for the judge, (if the accused be contumacious, arro­ <lb/>
            gant, or full of assurance,) indignation, the judge being often in­ <lb/>
            fluenced, not only by an act or word, but by look, air, or manner. <note type="footnote"> * See IV. 1, 5—27. </note><note type="footnote"> t V. 13, 56. </note><note type="footnote"> t I. 6, 42. </note><note type="footnote"> § Act.

            The accuser* of Cossutianus Capito was thought, when I was <lb/>
            young, to have made a very happy remark, in Greek,! indeed, <lb/>
            but to this effect, You are ashamed to fear even Cœsar. 15. <lb/>
            But the most effective way for the accuser to excite the feel­ <lb/>
            ings of the judge, is to make that which he lays to the charge <lb/>
            of the accused appear the most atrocious act possible, or, if <lb/>
            the subject allow, the most deplorable. Atrocity is made to <lb/>
            appear from such considerations as these, What has been done, <lb/>
            by whom, against whom, with what feeling, at what time, in <lb/>
            what place, in what manner; all which have infinite ramifica­ <lb/>
            tions. 16. We complain that somebody has been beaten; we <lb/>
            must first speak of the act; and then state whether the <lb/>
            sufferer was an old man, or a youth, or a magistrate, or a man <lb/>
            of high character, or one who has deserved well of his country ; <lb/>
            also whether he was struck by some vile contemptible fellow; <lb/>
            or, on the other hand, by some tyrannical person, or by some <lb/>
            one from whom he ought least of all to have received such <lb/>
            treatment; also whether he was struck, as it might be, on a <lb/>
            solemn festival, or when prosecutions for similar offences were <lb/>
            being rigorously conducted, or at a time when the government was <lb/>
            unsettled, or, as to place, in a theatre, in a temple, in a public as­ <lb/>
            sembly, for under such circumstances the offence is aggravated; <lb/>
            IT. also whether it can be proved that he was not struck by <lb/>
            mistake, or in a sudden fit of passion, or, if in a passion, with <lb/>
            great injustice, when, perhaps, he was taking the part of hil <lb/>
            father, or had made some reply t to the aggressor, or was <lb/>
            standing for office in opposition to him; and whether the <lb/>
            aggressor would have proceeded to greater violence than he <lb/>
            actually committed. But the manner contributes most to the <lb/>
            heinousness of the act, if he struck the person violently, or <lb/>
            insultingly; as Demosthenes excites odium against Meidias <lb/>
            by alluding to the part of his body which was struck, and the <lb/>
            look and mien of the striker. 18. A man has been killed; <lb/>
            we must consider whether it was with a sword, or fire, or <note type="footnote"> 0 Who the accuser was we do not know. It appears from Tacitus, <lb/>
            Ann. xiii. 33, that Cossutianus Capito was condemned for extortion in <lb/>
            his province of Cilicia. See also Juv. viii. 92. </note><note type="footnote"> t It had become customary to plead occasionally in Greek since the <lb/>

            the aggressor committed, had not been borne by the young man in <lb/>
            silence. Compare Terent. Phorm. Prol. 19. Spalding. </note> <pb n="412"/>

            poison; with one wound or with several; whether suddenly, or <lb/>
            whether he was made to languish in tortures; all which con.. <lb/>
            siderations have great effect in this way.-</p>
          <p>The accuser, also, often attempts to excite pity, as when he <lb/>
            bewails the sad fate of him whose cause he is pleading, or the <lb/>
            destitution of his children or parents. 19. He may also move <lb/>
            the judges by a representation of the future, showing what <lb/>
            will be the consequences to those who complain of violence <lb/>
            and injustice, unless their cause be avenged; that they must <lb/>
            flee from their country, sacrifice their property, or endure <lb/>
            everything that their enemies may be disposed to inflict on ther. <lb/>
            20. But it is more frequently the part of the accuser to guard <lb/>
            the feelings of the judge against that pity which the accused <lb/>
            would seek to excite, and to urge him to give judgment with <lb/>
            boldness. In doing so, he may also anticipate what he thinks <lb/>
            his opponent likely to say or do; for this course makes the <lb/>
            judges more cautious in adhering to the sacredness of their <lb/>
            oath, and diminishes the influence of those who have to reply, <lb/>
            since what has been once stated by the accuser, will, if urged <lb/>
            in favour of the accused, be no longer new; thus Servius <lb/>
            Sulpicius, in pleading against Aufidia,t admonishes the judges <lb/>
            that the danger to the witnesses from those persons ‡ was not to <lb/>
            be brought against him. It is also previously intimated by <lb/>
            Æschines § what sort of defence Demosthenes was likely to <lb/>
            use. Judges may sometimes be instructed, too, as to answers <lb/>
            which they should make to those who may solicit them in <lb/>
            favour of the defendant; an instruction which is a species of <lb/>
            recapitulation.</p>
          <p>21. As to a party on trial, his dignity, or manly pursuits, or <lb/>
            wounds received in war, or nobility of birth, or the services of his <lb/>
            ancestors, may be subjects of recommendation to him, This <lb/>
            kind of considerations Cicero and Asinius Pollio have urged <lb/>
            even emulously, Cicero || for Scaurus the father, and Pollio for <lb/>

            into danger, may be pleaded in his favour, if he appear, <lb/>
            for example, to have incurred enmity for some honourable <lb/>
            act, and his goodness, humanity, pity, may especially be <lb/>
            eulogized; for a person seems justly to solicit- from the <lb/>
            judge that which he himself has shown to others. In this <lb/>
            part of a speech,† too, allusions may be made to the public <lb/>
            good, to the honour of the judges, to precedent, to regard for pos­ <lb/>
            terity. 23. But that which produces the most powerful im­ <lb/>
            pression is pity, which not only forces the judge to change his <lb/>
            opinions, but to manifest the feelings in his breast even by <lb/>
            tears. Pity will be excited by dwelling either on that which <lb/>
            the accused has suffered, or on that which he is actually <lb/>
            suffering, or on that which awaits him if he be condemned; <lb/>
            representations which have double force, when we show from <lb/>
            what condition he has fallen, and into what condition he is in <lb/>
            danger of falling. 24. To these considerations age and sex may <lb/>
            add weight, as well as objects of affection, I mean children, <lb/>
            parents, and other relatives; and all these matters may be <lb/>
            treated in various ways. Sometimes also the advocate num­ <lb/>
            bers himself among his client's connexions, as Cicero in his <lb/>
            speech for Milo :‡ 0 unhappy that I an ! O unfortunate that <lb/>
            thou art ! Could you, Milo, by means of those who are this <lb/>
            day your judges, recall me into my country, and cannot I, by <lb/>
            means of the same judges, retain you in yours ? 25. This is a very <lb/>
            good resource, if, as was then the case, entreaty is unsuited to <lb/>
            the party who is accused ; for who would endure to hear Milo <lb/>
            supplicating for his life, when he acknowledged that he had <lb/>
            killed a nobleman because he deserved to be killed ? Cicero, <lb/>
            therefore, sought to gain Milo § the favour of the judges for <lb/>
            his magnanimity, and took upon himself the part of suppliant <lb/>
            for him.</p>
          <p>In this part of a speech prosopopeia are extremely effective, <lb/>
            that is, fictitious addresses delivered in another person's <lb/>
            character, such as are suitable either to a prosecutor or <note type="footnote"> * The text has Juste enim tunc petere, but Spalding justly observes <lb/>

            defendant.*Even mute objects t may touch the feelings, <lb/>
            either when we speak to them ourselves, or represent them at <lb/>
            speaking. 26. But the feelings are very strongly moved by <lb/>
            the personification of characters ; for the judge seems not te <lb/>
            be listening to an orator lamenting the sufferings of others, <lb/>
            but to hear with his own ears the expressions and tones of the <lb/>
            unfortunate suppliants themselves, whose presence, even with­ <lb/>
            out speech, would be sufficient to call forth tears ; and as <lb/>
            their pleadings would excite greater pity if they themselves <lb/>
            uttered them, so they are in some degree more effective when <lb/>
            they are spoken apparently by their own mouth in a personi­ <lb/>
            fication ; as with actors on the stage, the same voice and the <lb/>
            same pronunciation have greater power to excite the feelings <lb/>
            when accompanied with a mask representing the character. <lb/>
            27. Cicero, accordingly, though he puts no entreaties into the <lb/>
            mouth of Milo, but rather commends him to favour for his <lb/>
            firmness of mind, has yet attributed to him words and lamen­ <lb/>
            tations not unworthy of a man of spirit; 0 labours, undertaken <lb/>
            by me in vain! 0 deceitful hopes ! 0 thoughts, cherished by me <lb/>
            to no purpose!</p>
          <p>Yet our supplications for pity should not be long; as it is <lb/>
            observed, not without reason, that nothing dries sooner than <lb/>
            tears. 28. For, since time lessens even natural sorrows, the <lb/>
            representation of sorrow, which we produce in a speech, must <lb/>
            lose its effect still sooner; and, if we are prolix in it, the <lb/>
            hearer, wearied with tears, will recover his tranquillity, and <lb/>
            return from the emotion which had surprised him to the exer­ <lb/>
            cise of his reason. 29. Let us not allow the impressions that <lb/>
            we make, therefore, to cool, but, when we have raised the <lb/>
            feelings of our audience to the utmost, let us quit the subject, <lb/>
            and not expect that any person will long bewail the misfortunes <note type="footnote"> * Quotes litigatorem, docent vel patronum.] All commentators have <lb/>

            of another. Not only in other parts of our speech, accordingly, <lb/>
            but most of all in this part, our eloquence ought gradually to <lb/>
            rise; for whatever does not add to that which has been said, <lb/>
            seems even to take away from it, and the feeling which begins <lb/>
            to subside soon passes away.</p>
          <p>30. We may excite tears, however, not only by words, but <lb/>
            by acts ; and hence it become a practice to exhibit persons on <lb/>
            their trial in a squalid and pitiful garb, accompanied with their <lb/>
            children and parents ; hence, too, we see blood-stained swords <lb/>
            produced by accusers, with fractured bones extracted from <lb/>
            wounds, and garments spotted with blood; we behold wounds <lb/>
            unbound, and scourged backs exposed to view. 31. The effect <lb/>
            of such exhibitions is generally very strong, so that they fix <lb/>
            the attention of the spectators on the act as if it were com­ <lb/>
            mitted before their eyes. The blood-stained toga of Julius <lb/>
            Cæsar, when exhibited in the forum, excited the populace of <lb/>
            Rome almost to madness. It was known that he was killed ; <lb/>
            his body was even stretched on the bier; yet his robe, drenched <lb/>
            in blood, excited such a vivid idea of the crime, that Cæsar <lb/>
            seemed not to have been assassinated, but to be subjected to <lb/>
            assassination at that very moment. 32. But I would not for <lb/>
            that reason approve of a device of which I have read, and which <lb/>
            I have myself seen adopted, a representation, displayed in a <lb/>
            painting or on a curtain, of the act at the atrocity of which the <lb/>
            judge was to be shocked. For how conscious must a pleader <lb/>
            be of his inefficiency, who thinks that a dumb picture will <lb/>
            speak better for him than his own words ? 33. But a humble <lb/>
            garb, and wretched appearance, on the part as well of the <lb/>
            accused as of his relatives, has, I know, been of much effect; <lb/>
            aud I am aware that entreaties have contributed greatly to save <lb/>
            accused persons from death. To implore mercy of the judges, <lb/>
            therefore, by the defendants dearest objects of affection, (that <lb/>
            is to say, if he has children, wife, or parents,) will be of great <lb/>
            advantage, as well as to invoke the gods, since such invocation <lb/>
            seems to proceed from a clear conscience. 34. To fall pros­ <lb/>
            trate, also, and embrace the knees of the judge, may be <lb/>
            allowable at times, unless the character of the accused, and his <lb/>
            past life and station, dissuade him from such humiliation; for <lb/>
            there are some deeds that ought to be defended with the same <lb/>
            boldness with which they were committed. But regard is to <pb n="416"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B IV. </note> <lb/>
            be had to the defendant's dignity, with such caution that an <lb/>
            offensive confidence may not appear in him.</p>
          <p>35. Among all arguments for a client, the most potent, in <lb/>
            former times, was that by means of which Cicero seems chiefly <lb/>
            to have saved Lucius Muræna from the eminent men who <lb/>
            were his accusers, when he persuaded them that nothing was <lb/>
            more advantageous for the state of things at that period than <lb/>
            that Mursena should enter on his consulship the day before the <lb/>
            Kalends of January.* But this kind of argument is wholly <lb/>
            set aside in our days, as everything depends on the care and <lb/>
            protection of our sovereign, and cannot be endangered by the <lb/>
            issue of any single cause.</p>
          <p>36. I have spoken of prosecutors and defendants, because <lb/>
            t is on their trials that the pathetic is chiefly employed. But <lb/>
            private causes † also admit both kinds of perorations, that <lb/>
            which consists in a recapitulation of proofs, and that which <lb/>
            depends on the excitement of the feelings, the latter having <lb/>
            place whenever the accused party is in danger either as to <lb/>
            station or as to character; for to attempt such tragic pleadings <lb/>
            in trifling causes would be like trying to adjust the mask and <lb/>
            buskins of Hercules on an infant.</p>
          <p>37. Nor is it improper for me to intimate, that much of the <lb/>
            success of a peroration depends, in my opinion, on the manner <lb/>
            in which the defendant, who is presented before the judge, <lb/>
            accommodates his demeanour to that of him who pleads in his <lb/>
            favour; for ignorance, rusticity, stiffness, and vulgarity in a <lb/>
            client sometimes damp a pleader's efforts; and against such <lb/>
            untowardness he should take diligent precaution. 38. I have <lb/>
            seen the behaviour of clients quite at variance with the <lb/>
            language of their advocate, showing no concern in their coun­ <lb/>
            tenance, laughing without reason, and, by some act or look, <lb/>
            making even others laugh, especially when anything was <lb/>
            delivered at all theatrically. 39. On one occasion, an advo­ <lb/>
            cate led over a girl, who was said to be the sister of the <lb/>
            adverse party, (for it was about that point that the controversy <note type="footnote"> Cicero pro Flacc. c. 39, says that it was by this argument that he <lb/>
            saved Muræna. Quintilian, says Spalding, seems to intimate that that <lb/>
            consideration had more effect on the judges than Cicero's eloquence. </note><note type="footnote"> t In private causes there was properly only petitor and unde petitur, <lb/>

            was,) to the opposite benches,. as if intending to leave her in <lb/>
            the arms of her brother; but the brother, previously instructed <lb/>
            by me, had gone off; and the advocate, although an eloquent <lb/>
            man at other times, was struck dumb by his unexpected dis­ <lb/>
            appearance, and, with his ardour cooled, took his little girl <lb/>
            back again. 40. Another advocate, pleading for a woman who <lb/>
            was on her trial, thought it would have a great effect to exhibit <lb/>
            the likeness of her deceased husband; but the image excited <lb/>
            little else but laughter; for the persons whose business it was <lb/>
            to produce it, being ignorant what a peroration meant, dis­ <lb/>
            played it to view whenever the advocate looked towards them, <lb/>
            and, when it was brought still more into sight at the conclusion, <lb/>
            it destroyed the effect of all his previous eloquence by its ugli­ <lb/>
            ness, being a mere cast from an old man's dead body.t 41. It <lb/>
            is well known, too, what happened to Glycon, ‡ surnamed <lb/>
            Spiridion: A little boy, whom he brought into court, and <lb/>
            asked Why he was weeping, replied, " That he had had his ears <lb/>
            pulled by his tutor."§ But nothing is better adapted to show <lb/>
            the dangers attendant on perorations, than the story of Cicero <lb/>
            about the Cepasii.|| 42. Yet all such mishaps are easily reme­ <lb/>
            died by those who can alter the fashion of their speech; but <lb/>
            those who cannot vary from what they have composed, are <lb/>
            either struck dumb at such occurrences, or, as is frequently <lb/>
            the case, say what is not true; for hence are such imperti­ <lb/>
            nences as these : He is raising his supplicating hands towards <lb/>
            your knees, or, He is locked, unhappy man, in the embraces oj <lb/>
            his children, or, See, he recalls my attention, &amp;c.; though the <lb/>
            client does no single thing of all that his advocate attributes <lb/>
            to him. 43. These absurdities come from the schools, in <lb/>
            which we give play to our. imagination freely and with impu­ <note type="footnote"> * The defendant was on the right hand seats ; the accuser on the <lb/>

            nity, because whatever we wish is supposed to be done; but <lb/>
            reality does not allow of such suppositions, and Cassius Severus <lb/>
            made a most happy retort to a young orator who said, " Why <lb/>
            look you so sternly on me, Severus ?" "I did not, I assure <lb/>
            you," replied Cassius, " but you had written those words, I <lb/>
            suppose, in your notes, and so -here is a look for you," when he <lb/>
            threw on him as terrible a glance as he could possibly assume.</p>
          <p>44. The student ought above all things to be admonished, <lb/>
            also, that an orator should not attempt to excite tears, unless <lb/>
            he be endowed with extraordinary genius ; for as the effect on <lb/>
            the feelings, if he succeeds, is extremely powerful, so, if he <lb/>
            is unsuccessful, the result is vapidity; and a middling pleader <lb/>
            bad better leave the pathos to the quiet meditations of the <lb/>
            judges; 45. for the look, tone, and even the very face, of a de­ <lb/>
            fendant called to stand before the judges, are a laughing-stock <lb/>
            to such persons as they do not move. Let a pleader, therefore, <lb/>
            in such a case, carefully measure and contemplate his strength, <lb/>
            and consider how difficult a task he will have to undertake. In <lb/>
            the, result there will be no medium; he will either provoke <lb/>
            tears or laughter.</p>
          <p>46. But the business of a peroration is not only to excite <lb/>
            feelings of pity, but also to deaden them, either by a set <lb/>
            speech, which may recall the judges, when shaken by com. <lb/>
            passion, to considerations of justice, or by some jocose remark, <lb/>
            as, Give the child a cake, that he may leave off crying; or, as <lb/>
            a pleader said to his corpulent client, whose opponent, a mere <lb/>
            child, had been carried round among the judges by his advo. <lb/>
            cate, What shall I do? I cannot carry you. 47. But such <lb/>
            pleasantries must have nothing of buffoonery; and I cannot <lb/>
            praise the orator,* though he was among the most eminent of <lb/>
            his time, who, when some children were brought in at the pero­ <lb/>
            ration by the opposite party, threw some playtbings† among <lb/>
            them, for which they began to scramble; for the children's <lb/>
            insensibility to ill that threatened them might of itself excite <lb/>
            compassion. 48. Nor can I commend him, who, when a blood- <lb/>
            stained sword was produced by his adversary, which he offered <lb/>
            as a proof that a man had been killed, suddenly took flight, as <note type="footnote"> * Who he was, I find nothing to assist me in conjecturing. The <lb/>
            story, I believe, is nowhere else told. </note><note type="footnote"> t Talos.] Bones from the pastern of cloven footed animals, with <lb/>

            if terrified, from his seat, and looking out from the crowd, <lb/>
            with his head half covered with his robe, asked whether the <lb/>
            man with the sword was yet gone; for he raised a laugh, <lb/>
            indeed, but made himself at the same time ridiculous. 49. The <lb/>
            effect of such acting is to be dispelled by the calm power of elo­ <lb/>
            quence ; and Cicero gives us excellent examples, who, in his <lb/>
            oration for Rabirius, attacks with great force the production of <lb/>
            the likeness of Saturninus,* and, in his speech for Varenus, † <lb/>
            rallies with much wit the young man whose wound was unbound <lb/>
            from time to time during the trial.</p>
          <p>50. There are also perorations of a milder sort, in which <lb/>
            we seek to pacify an adversary, if his character, for instance, <lb/>
            be such that respect is due to him, or in which we give him <lb/>
            some friendly admonition, and exhort him to concord; a kind <lb/>
            of peroration that was admirably managed by Passienns,‡ <lb/>
            when he pleaded the cause of his wife Domitia, to recover a <lb/>
            sum of money, against her brother .Ænobarbus, for, after he <lb/>
            had enlarged on their relationship, be added some remarks on <lb/>
            their fortune, of which both had abundance, saying, There is <lb/>
            nothing of which tou have less need than that about which you <lb/>
            are contending.</p>
          <p>51. But all these addresses to the feelings, though they are <lb/>
            thought by some to have a place only in the exordium and the <lb/>
            peroration, in which indeed they are most frequently intro <lb/>
            duced, are admissible also in other parts, but more sparingly, <lb/>
            as it is from them that the decision of the cause must be <lb/>
            chiefly evolved ;§ but in the peroration, if anywhere, we may <lb/>
            call forth all the resources of eloquence; 52. for if we have <lb/>
            treated the other parts successfully, we are secure of the at­ <lb/>
            tention of the judges at the conclusion; where, having passed <lb/>
            the rocks and shallows on our voyage, we may expand our <note type="footnote"> Titus Labienus, the accuser of Rabirius, had exhibited an image <lb/>

            sails in safety; and, as amplification forms the greatest part <lb/>
            of a peroration, we may use language and thoughts of the <lb/>
            greatest magnificence and elegance. It is then that we may <lb/>
            shake the theatre, when we come to that with which the old <lb/>
            tragedies and comedies were concluded, Plaudite, " Give us <lb/>
            your applause."</p>
          <p>53. But in other parts we must work upon the feelings, as <lb/>
            occasion for working on any of them may present itself, for <lb/>
            matters of a horrible or lamentable nature should never be <lb/>
            related without exciting in the mind of the judges a feeling in <lb/>
            conformity with them; and when we discuss the quality of <lb/>
            any act, a remark addressed to the feelings may be aptly sub­ <lb/>
            joined to the proof of each particular point. 54. And when <lb/>
            we plead a complicated cause, consisting, it may be said, of <lb/>
            several causes, we shall be under the necessity of using, as it <lb/>
            were, several perorations; as Cicero has done in his pleading <lb/>
            against Verres; for he has lamented over Philodamus,* over <lb/>
            the captains of the vessels,! over the tortures of the Roman <lb/>
            citizens,‡and over several other of that prætor's victims. 55. <lb/>
            Some call these <foreign xml:lang="grc">μειϰοί ἑπίλογοι</foreign> by which they mean parts of <lb/>
            a divided peroration; but to me they seem not so much parts <lb/>
            as species of perorations; for the very terms <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑπίλογς</foreign> and <lb/>
            peroratio show, clearly enough, that the conclusion of a speech <lb/>
            is implied.</p>

          <p>Necessity of studying how to work on the minds of the judges, § 1, 2. <lb/>

            I have of necessity, therefore, said something of the feelings <note type="footnote"> * In Verr. i 30. </note><note type="footnote"> + V. 46, 46. </note><note type="footnote"> t V. 53, 68. </note> <pb n="421"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            in treating of it, yet I could not bring the whole of that sub. <lb/>
            ject under one head, nor indeed should I have been justified <lb/>
            in doing so. A duty of the orator, accordingly, still remains <lb/>
            to be considered, which is of the greatest efficacy in securing <lb/>
            his success, and is of far more difficulty than any of those <lb/>
            already noticed, I mean that of influencing the minds of the <lb/>
            judges, and of moulding and transforming them, as it were, <lb/>
            to that disposition which we wish them to assume. 2. With <lb/>
            regard to this point, I have touched on a few particulars, such <lb/>
            as the subject called forth, but so as rather to show what <lb/>
            ought to be done than how we may be able to effect it. The <lb/>
            nature of the whole subject must now be considered more <lb/>
            deeply.</p>
          <p>Throughout the whole of any cause, as I remarked,* there <lb/>
            is room for addresses to the feelings. The nature of the feel­ <lb/>
            ings is varied, and not to be treated cursorily; nor does the <lb/>
            whole art of oratory present any subject that requires greater <lb/>
            study. 3. As to other matters, moderate and limited powers of <lb/>
            mind, if they be but aided by learning and practice, may in­ <lb/>
            vigorate them, and bring them to some fruit; certainly there <lb/>
            are, and always have been, no small number of pleaders, who <lb/>
            could find out, with sufficient skill, whatever would be of ser­ <lb/>
            vice to establish proofs; and such men I do not despise, <lb/>
            though I consider that their ability extends no farther than <lb/>
            to the communication of instruction to the judge; and, to say <lb/>
            what I think, I look upon them as fit only to explain causes <lb/>
            to eloquent pleaders; but such as can seize the attention of <lb/>
            the judge, and lead him to whatever frame of mind he desires, <lb/>
            forcing him to weep or feel angry as their words influence <lb/>
            him,† are but rarely to be found. 4. But it is this power that <lb/>
            is supreme in causes; it is this that makes eloquence effec <lb/>
            tive. ‡ As to arguments, they generally arise out of the cause, <lb/>
            and are more numerous on the side that has the greater jus­ <lb/>
            tice ; so that he who gains his cause by force of arguments, <lb/>
            will only have the satisfaction of knowing that his advocate <note type="footnote"> C. 1, sect. 51. </note><note type="footnote"> t Quo dido flendum et irascendum esset.] Dicto, as Spalding observes, <lb/>

            culiar duty of the orator is required. This the contending <lb/>
            parties cannot teach; this cannot be put into written instruc­ <lb/>
            tions. Proofs in our favour, it is true, may make the judge <lb/>
            think our cause the better, but impressions on his feelings <lb/>
            make him wish it to be the better, and what he wishes he also <lb/>
            believes. 6. For when judges begin to feel indignant, to favour, <lb/>
            to hate, to pity, they fancy that their own cause is concerned; <lb/>
            and, as lovers are not competent judges of beauty, because <lb/>
            passion overpowers the sense of sight, so a judge, when led <lb/>
            away by his feelings, loses the faculty of discerning truth ; he <lb/>
            is hurried along as it were by a flood, and yields to the force <lb/>
            of a torrent. 7. What effect arguments and witnesses have <lb/>
            produced, it is only the final decision that proves; but the <lb/>
            judge, when his feelings are touched by the orator, shows, <lb/>
            while he is still sitting and hearing, what his inclination is. <lb/>
            When the tear, which is the great object in most perorations, <lb/>
            swells forth, is not the sentence plainly pronounced? To <lb/>
            this end, then, let the orator direct his efforts; this is his <lb/>
            work, this his labour without this everything else is bare and <lb/>
            meagre, weak and unattractive; so true is it, that the life and <lb/>
            soul of eloquence is shown in the effect produced on the <lb/>
            feelings.</p>
          <p>8. Of feelings, as we are taught by the old writers, there <lb/>
            are two kinds; one, which the Greeks included under the term, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθος</foreign>which we translate rightly and literally by the word <lb/>
            '' passion ;" the other, to which they give the appellation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</foreign> <lb/>
            for which, as I consider, the Roman language has no equiva­ <lb/>
            lent term ; it is rendered, however, by mores, " manners ;" <lb/>
            whence that part of philosophy, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡθιϰή</foreign>, is <lb/>
            called moralis, " moral." 9. But when I consider the nature <lb/>
            of the thing, it appears to me that it is not so much mores in <lb/>
            general that is meant, as a certain proprietas morum, or " pro­ <lb/>
            priety of manners;" for under the word mores is comprehended <lb/>
            every habitude of the mind. The more cautious writers, <lb/>
            therefore, have chosen rather to express the sense than to <lb/>
            interpret the words, and have designated the one class of feel­ <lb/>
            ings as the more violent, the other as the more gentle and calm; <note type="footnote"> * Hoc opus, hic labor estVirgo Æn, vi. 128. </note> <pb n="423"/>
            <note type="margin"> OIl. II. </note> <lb/>
            under <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθος</foreign> they have included the stronger passions, under <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡθος</foreign> the gender, saying that the former are adapted to com­ <lb/>
            mand, the latter to persuade, the former to disturb, the latter <lb/>
            to conciliate. 10. Some of the very learned* add that the <lb/>
            effect of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθος</foreign> is but transitory; but while I admit that <lb/>
            this is more generally the case, I consider that there are some <lb/>
            subjects which require a permanent strain of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθος</foreign> to run <lb/>
            through the whole of them. Addresses however to the milder <lb/>
            feelings require not less art and practice, though they do not <lb/>
            call for so much energy and vehemence ; and they enter into <lb/>
            the majority of causes, or rather, in some sense,! into all; <lb/>
            11. for as nothing is treated by the orator that may not be <lb/>
            referred either to <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθος</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ̃θος</foreign>‡ whatever is said concerning <lb/>
            honour or advantage, concerning things that may be done or <lb/>
            may not be done, is very properly included under the term <lb/>
            ethic. Some think that commendation and palliation are the <lb/>
            peculiar duties of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ̃θος</foreign>and I do not deny that they fall <lb/>
            under that head, but I do not allow that they are its only <lb/>
            object. 12. I would also add that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ̃̃θος</foreign>are some­ <lb/>
            times of the same nature, the one in a greater and the other <lb/>
            in a less degree, as love, for instance, will be <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθος</foreign> an&amp;friend­ <lb/>
            ship and sometimes of a different nature, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθος</foreign> in a <lb/>
            peroration, will excite the judges, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ̃θος</foreign> soothe them.</p>
          <p>But I must develope more precisely the force of the term <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ̃θος</foreign>, as it seems not to be sufficiently intimated by the word <lb/>
            itself. 13. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ̃θοςο</foreign>f which we form a conception, and which <lb/>
            we desire to find in speakers, is recommended, above all, by <lb/>
            goodness, being not only mild and placid, but for the most <lb/>
            part pleasing and polite, and amiable and attractive to the <lb/>
            hearers; and the greatest merit in the expression of it, is, <lb/>
            that it should seem to flow from the nature of the things and <note type="footnote"> * Adjiciunt quidam peritorum <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθος</foreign> temporaLE esse The strangeness <lb/>
            of the word peritorum induces Spalding to suspect that the words <lb/>

            following words, honesta and utiUa, but this mode is so forced that I <lb/>
            cannot concur with him. </note> <pb n="424"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.VI. </note> <lb/>
            persons with which we are concerned, so that the moral cha­ <lb/>
            racter of the speaker may clearly appear, and be recognized <lb/>
            as it were, in his discourse. 14. This kind of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</foreign> ought especi­ <lb/>
            ally to prevail between persons closely connected, as often as they <lb/>
            endure anything from each other, or grant pardon, or satisfac­ <lb/>
            tion, or offer admonition, all which should be free from anger, <lb/>
            or dislike. But the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</foreign> of a father towards his son, of a <lb/>
            guardian towards his ward, of a husband towards his wife, (all <lb/>
            of whom manifest affection for those with whom they are <lb/>
            offended, and throw blame upon them by no other means than <lb/>
            showing that they love them,)* is very different from that <lb/>
            which is shown by an old man towards a young one from whom <lb/>
            he has received an insult, or from that of a man of rank <lb/>
            towards an inferior who has been disrespectful to him, (for the <lb/>
            man of rank may only be provoked, the old man must also be <lb/>
            concerned.) 15. Of the same character, though less affecting <lb/>
            to the feelings, are solicitations for forgiveness, or apologies for <lb/>
            the amours of youth. Sometimes, too, a little gentle raillery <lb/>
            of another persons heatt may have its source in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</foreign>, <lb/>
            though it does not proceed from such a source only. But <lb/>
            what more peculiarly belongs to it is simulation of some virtue, <lb/>
            of making satisfaction to some one, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰςωνεία</foreign> in asking ques. <lb/>
            tions, which means something different from that which it <lb/>
            expresses. 16. Hence also springs that stronger appeal to the <lb/>
            feelings, adapted to draw the dislike of the judge on an over­ <lb/>
            bearing adversary, when, by feigning submission to him, we <lb/>
            imply a quiet censure on his presumption; for the very fact <lb/>
            that we yield to him, proves him to be arrogant and insupport­ <lb/>
            able ; and orators who are fond of invective, or affect liberty <lb/>
            of speech, are not aware how much more effective it is thus to <lb/>
            throw odium on an opponent than to reproach him, since that <lb/>
            kind of treatment renders him disliked, while reproach would <lb/>
            bring dislike on ourselves. 17. The feeling arising from our <lb/>
            love and regard for our friends and relatives is, we may say. of <lb/>
            an intermediate character, being stronger than <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</foreign> and weaker <lb/>
            than <foreign xml:lang="grc">πὰθος</foreign>.</p>

             <note type="margin">on. II.] </note> <lb/>
            cises of the schools <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤθη</foreign>, in which we are accustomed to repre­ <lb/>
            sent the characters of the rustic, the superstitious, the <lb/>
            avaricious, the timid, agreeably to the thesis proposed for dis­ <lb/>
            cussion. For as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤθη</foreign> are manners, we, in imitating manners, <lb/>
            adapt our speech to them.</p>
          <p>18. All this species of eloquence, however, requires the <lb/>
            speaker to be a man of good character, and of pleasing <lb/>
            manners. The virtues which he ought to praise, if possible, <lb/>
            in his client, he should possess, or be thought to possess, him­ <lb/>
            self. Thus he will be a great support to the causes that he <lb/>
            undertakes, to which he will bring credit by his own excellent <lb/>
            qualities. But he who, while he speaks, is thought a bad man, <lb/>
            must certainly speak ineffectively; for he will not be thought <lb/>
            to speak sincerely; if he did, his <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</foreign>, or character, would <lb/>
            appear. 19. With a view to credibility, accordingly, the style <lb/>
            of speaking in this kind of oratory should be calm and mild ; <lb/>
            it requires,* at least, nothing of vehemence, elevation, or sub­ <lb/>
            limity ; to speak with propriety, in a pleasing manner, and an <lb/>
            air of probability, is sufficient for it; and the middling sort of <lb/>
            eloquence is therefore most suitable.</p>
          <p>20. What the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθος</foreign>, and we, very .properly, <lb/>
            affectus, is quite different from that which is referred to the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤθος</foreign> : and that I may mark, as exactly as I can, † the diversity <lb/>
            between them, I would say that the one is similar to comedy, <lb/>
            the other to tragedy. This kind of eloquence is almost wholly <lb/>
            engaged in exciting anger, hatred, fear envy, or pity ; and <lb/>
            from what sources its topics are to be drawn is manifest to all, <lb/>
            and has been mentioned by me‡ in speaking of the exordium <lb/>
            and peroration. 21. Fear, however, I wish to be understood <lb/>
            in two senses, that which we feel ourselves, and that which we <lb/>
            cause to others; and I would observe that there are two sorts <lb/>
            of invidia, “dislike,” one that makes invidum, “envious,” <lb/>
            and another that makes invidiosum, “disliked.”§ The first is <lb/>
            applied to persons, the second to things; and it is with this <lb/>
            that eloquence has the greater difficulty; for though some <note type="footnote"> * All the texts have desideret, but we must read, as Rollin says, <lb/>
            desiderat. </note><note type="footnote">t Proximè.] That is proximè ad veritatem, quàm verissimè fieri potest. <lb/>

            things are detestable in themselves, as parricide, murder, <lb/>
            poisoning, others require to be made to appear so. 22. Such <lb/>
            representation is made, either by showing that what we have <lb/>
            suffered is more grievous than evils ordinarily considered <lb/>
            great; as in these lines of Virgil,* <lb/>
            0 felix una ante alias Priame<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϊ</foreign>a virgo, <lb/>
            Hostilem ad tumulum Trojœ sub mœnibus altis <lb/>

            Daughter of Priam, doom'd to die before <lb/>
            Thy enemy's tomb, beneath the lofty walls <lb/>
            Of Troy! <lb/>
            (for how wretched was the lot of Andromache, if that of <lb/>
            Polyxena, compared with hers, was happy!) 23. or by mag­ <lb/>
            nifying some injury that we have received, so as to make even <lb/>
            injuries that are far less appear intolerable; as, If you had <lb/>
            struck me, you would have been inexcusable ; but you wounded <lb/>
            me. But these points I shall consider with more attention, <lb/>
            when I come to speak of amplification. In the mean time, <lb/>
            I shall content myself with observing that the object of the <lb/>
            pathetic is not only that those things may appear grievous <lb/>
            and lamentable, which in reality are so, but also that those <lb/>
            which are generally regarded as inconsiderable, may seem <lb/>
            intolerable; as when we say that there is more injury in <lb/>
            a verbal insult than in a blow, or that there is more punishment <lb/>
            in dishonour than in death. 24. For such is the power of <lb/>
            eloquence, that it not only impels the judge to that to which <lb/>
            he is led by the nature of the matter before him, but excites <lb/>
            feelings which are not suggested by it, or strengthens such as <lb/>
            are suggested. This is what the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">δείνωσις</foreign>, language <lb/>
            adding force to things unbecoming, cruel, detestable ; in which <lb/>
            excellence, more than in any other, Demosthenes showed his <lb/>
            extraordinary power.</p>
          <p>25. If I thought it sufficient merely to adhere to the pre­ <lb/>
            cepts that have been delivered, I should do enough for this <lb/>
            part of my work by omitting nothing that I have read or <lb/>
            learned, that is at all reasonable, on the subject; but it is my <lb/>
            intention to open the deepest recesses of the topic on which <lb/>
            ve have entered, and to set forth what I have acquired, not <lb/>
            A ‡n any teacher, but from my own experience, and under the <lb/>
            accusin <note type="footnote">* An. ii. 821. </note> <pb n="427"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            guidance of nature herself. 26. The chief requisite, then, <lb/>
            for moving the feelings of others, is, as far as I can judge, <lb/>
            that we ourselves be moved; for the assumption of grief, and <lb/>
            anger, and indignation, will be often ridiculous, if we adapt <lb/>
            merely our words and looks, and not our minds, to those <lb/>
            passions. For what else is the reason that mourners, when <lb/>
            their grief is fresh at least, are heard to utter exclamations of <lb/>
            the greatest expressiveness, and that anger sometimes produces <lb/>
            eloquence even in the ignorant, but that there are strong <lb/>
            sensations in them, and sincerity of feeling ? 27. In deliver­ <lb/>
            ing, therefore, whatever we wish to appear like truth, let us <lb/>
            assimilate ourselves to the feelings of those who are truly <lb/>
            affected, and let our language proceed from such a temper of <lb/>
            mind as we would wish to excite in the judge. Will he grieve, <lb/>
            let me ask, who shall hear me, that speak for the purpose of <lb/>
            moving him, expressing myself without concern ? Will be be <lb/>
            angry, if the orator who seeks to excite him to anger, and to <lb/>
            force him to it, shows no like feeling ? Will he shed tears <lb/>
            at the words of one who pleads with dry eyes ? 28. Such <lb/>
            results are impossible. We are not burned without fire, or <lb/>
            wet without moisture; nor does one thing give to another the <lb/>
            colour which it has not itself. Our first object must be, <lb/>
            therefore, that what we wish to impress the judge may impress <lb/>
            ourselves, and that we may be touched ourselves before we <lb/>
            begin to touch others.</p>
          <p>29. But by what means, it may be asked, shall we be affected, <lb/>
            since our feelings are not in our own power ? I will attempt <lb/>
            to say something also on this point. What the Greeks call <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαντασίαι</foreign> we call visiones ; images by which the representations <lb/>
            of absent objects are so distinctly represented to the mind, <lb/>
            that we seem to see them with our eyes, and to have them <lb/>
            before us. 30. Whoever shall best conceive such images, will <lb/>
            have the greatest power in moving the feelings. A man of <lb/>
            such lively imagination some call <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐϕαντασίωτος</foreign>, being one who <lb/>
            can vividly represent to himself things, voices, actions, with <lb/>
            the exactness of reality; and this faculty may readily be <lb/>
            acquired by ourselves if we desire it. When, for example, <lb/>
            while the mind is unoccupied, and we are indulging in <lb/>
            chimerical hopes, and dreams, as of men awake, the images of <lb/>
            which I am speaking beset us so closely, that we seem to be <lb/>
            on a journey, on a voyage, in a battle, to be haranguing <pb n="428"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            assemblies of people, to dispose of wealth which we do not <lb/>
            possess, and not to be thinking but acting, shall we not turn <lb/>
            this lawless power of our minds to our advantage ? 31. I make <lb/>
            a complaint that a man has been murdered; shall I not bring <lb/>
            before my eyes everything that is likely to have happened <lb/>
            when the murder occurred ? Shall not the assassin suddenly <lb/>
            sally forth ? Shall not the other tremble, cry out, supplicate, <lb/>
            or flee? Shall I not behold the one striking, the other <lb/>

            the expiring victim, present itself fully to my mental view ? <lb/>
            32. Hence will result that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνὰϱγεια</foreign>, which is called by Cicero <lb/>
            illustration and evidentness, which seems not so much to <lb/>
            narrate as to exhibit; and our feelings will be moved not less <lb/>
            strongly than if we were actually present at the affairs of <lb/>
            which we are speaking. Are not the following descriptions <lb/>
            to be numbered among representations of this nature ? <lb/>

            The shuttle from her hands was shaken forth, <lb/>
            And all the web unravelled. <lb/>

            positis insignibus ‡ <lb/>
            His trappings laid aside <lb/>
            Has not the same poet also conceived with the deepest feeling <lb/>
            the idea of a man's dying moments, when he says <lb/>
            Etdulces moriens reminiscitur Argos,§ <lb/>
            And on his dearest Argos thinks in death ! <lb/>
            34. Where there is occasion for moving compassion, too, we <lb/>
            must endeavour to believe, and to feel convinced, that the evils <lb/>
            of which we complain have actually happened to ourselves. <lb/>
            We must imagine ourselves to be those very persons for whom <lb/>
            we lament as having suffered grievous, undeserved, and pitiable <lb/>
            treatment; we must not plead their cause as that of another, <note type="footnote"> * Virg. Æn. ix. 476. </note><note type="footnote"> + Æn. xi. 40. </note><note type="footnote"> t All. xi. 89. </note><note type="footnote"> I Æn. x. 781. </note> <pb n="429"/>

            but must endeavour to feel for a time their sufferings; and <lb/>
            thus we shall say for them what we should in similar circum­ <lb/>
            stances say for ourselves. 35. I have often seen actors, both <lb/>
            in tragedy and comedy, when they laid aside their mask after <lb/>
            going through some distressing scene, quit the theatre weeping; <lb/>
            and if the mere delivery of what is written by another can <lb/>
            add such force to fictitious feelings, what effect ought we to <lb/>
            produce, when we should feel what we express, and may be <lb/>
            moved at the condition of those who are on their trial ?</p>
          <p>36. In the schools, also, it would be proper for learners to <lb/>
            feel moved with the subjects on which they speak, and imagine <lb/>
            that they are real, especially as we discuss matters there <lb/>
            more frequently as parties concerned than as advocates. We <lb/>
            assume the character of an orphan, of a person that has been <lb/>
            shipwrecked, or one that is in danger of losing his life; but <lb/>
            to what purpose is it to assume their characters, if we do net <lb/>
            adopt their feelings ? This art I thought should not be <lb/>
            concealed from the reader, the art by which I myself (whatever <lb/>
            is or was my real power) conceive that I have attained at least <lb/>
            some reputation for ability; and I have often been so affected, <lb/>
            that not only tears, but paleness, and sorrow, similar to real <lb/>
            sorrow, have betrayed my emotions <pb n="430"/>

          <p>Of the power of exciting laughter in an audience, § 1. There was <lb/>
            little of it in Demosthenes ; perhaps a superabundance of it in <lb/>
            Cicero, 2—5. Causes of laughter not sufficiently explained, 6, 7. <lb/>
            Is of great effect, 8—10. Depends far more on nature and <lb/>
            favourable circumstances than on art, 11—13. No instructions <lb/>
            given in exciting laughter, 14—16. Various names for jocularity <lb/>
            or wit, 17—21. Depends partly on matter, partly on words; <lb/>
            subjects of it, 22—24. Laughter may be excited by some act, or <lb/>
            look, or gesture, 25 - 27. What is becoming to the orator, 28—32. <lb/>
            What to be avoided by him, 33—35. Topics for jesting, and modes <lb/>
            of it, 36—46. Ambiguity in words, 47—56. The best jests are <lb/>
            taken from things, not from words ; of similarity, 57—62. Of dis­ <lb/>
            similarity, 63. 64. From all forms of argument arise occasions for <lb/>
            jesting, 65, 66. Jests in the form of tropes and figures, 67—70. Of <lb/>
            jocular refutation, 71—78. Of eluding a charge ; of pretended con­ <lb/>
            fession, 79—81. Some kinds of jests are beneath an orator, 82, 83. <lb/>
            Of deceiving expectation, 84—87. Of jocular imitation, 88. Of <lb/>
            attributing thoughts to ourselves or others; and of irony, 89—92. <lb/>
            The least offensive jokes are the best, 93—95. Quotations from <lb/>
            poets, proverbs, and anecdotes, 96—98. Apparent absurdities, 99, <lb/>
            100. Domitius Marsus confounds politeness with humour, 101— <lb/>
            107. His distinctions, 108—112.</p>
          <p>1. VERY different from this is the talent which, by exciting <lb/>
            laughter in the judge, dispels melancholy affections, diverting his <lb/>
            mind from too intense application to the subject before it, re­ <lb/>
            cruiting at times its powers, and reviving it after disgust and <lb/>
            fatigue.</p>
          <p>2. How difficult it is to succeed in that way, even the two <lb/>
            greatest of all orators, the one the prince of Greek and the <lb/>
            other of Latin eloquence, afford us sufficient proof. Most <lb/>
            think that the faculty was altogether wanting to Demosthenes,* <lb/>
            and moderation in the management of it to Cicero. Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes, certainly, cannot be thought to have been unwilling to <lb/>
            cultivate it, as his jests, though very few, and by no means <lb/>
            correspondent to his other excellences, plainly show that jocu­ <note type="footnote"> * Gesner observes that Cicero, Orate c. 26, in noticing the general <lb/>
            opinion that Demosthenes wanted humour, says that he had much <lb/>
            urbanitas ; and that Plutarch in his Life of Demosthenes mentions some <lb/>
            of his jests. Capperonier refers to Longinus, c. 34, who says that <lb/>
            when Demosthenes attempted to be facetious he only raised a laugh at <lb/>
            his own expense. Spalding remarks that the judgment of Dionysius <lb/>
            Halicarnassensis, <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ Δημοσθ. δεινότητος</foreign>, c. 54, agrees with the com­ <lb/>
            mon opinion. </note> <pb n="431"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH ni.] </note> <lb/>
            larity was not disliked by him, but that it had not been liberally <lb/>
            bestowed on him by nature. 3. But as for our own coun­ <lb/>
            tryman, he was regarded, not only when not engaged in plead­ <lb/>
            ing, but even in his public speeches, as too much an affecter <lb/>
            of pleasantry. To myself, whether I judge rightly in that re­ <lb/>
            spect, or whether 1 err through immoderate admiration for our <lb/>
            great master of eloquence, there appears to have been an <lb/>
            extraordinary vein of delicate wit in him. 4. For in his <lb/>
            common conversation, in disputes, and in examining witnesses, <lb/>
            he uttered more jokes than any other orator; the dull jests in <lb/>
            his orations against Verres * he attributed to others, repeating <lb/>
            them as a part of his evidence; and the more vulgar they are, <lb/>
            the more probable is it that they were not of his invention, <lb/>
            but had been circulated among the people. 5. I could wish, <lb/>
            too, that his freedman Tiro, or whoever it was that published <lb/>
            the three books of his jests, had been more sparing as to their <lb/>
            number, and had used greater judgment in selecting than in­ <lb/>
            dustry in gathering; for he would then have been less exposed <lb/>
            to calumniators, who, however, as in regard to all the produc­ <lb/>
            tions of his genius, can more easily discover what may be taken <lb/>
            away than what may be added.</p>
          <p>6. But what causes the chief difficulty in lespect to jesting <lb/>
            is, that a saying adapted to excite laughter is generally based <lb/>
            on false reasoning, and has always t something low in it; it is <lb/>
            often purposely sunk into buffoonery ; it is never honourable to <lb/>
            him who is the subject of it; while the judgments of the <lb/>
            bearers with regard to it will be various, as a thing which is <lb/>
            estimated, not by any certain reasoning, but by some impulse, <lb/>
            I know not whether inexplicable, of the mind. 7. Certainly I <lb/>
            think that it has not been sufficiently explained by any one, <lb/>
            though many have attempted explanations, whence laughter <lb/>
            proceeds, which is excited, not only by actions or words, but <lb/>
            sometimes even by a touch of the body. Besides, it is not by <lb/>
            one kind of jests only that it is produced; for not merely witty <lb/>
            and agreeable acts or sayings, but what is said or done <lb/>
            foolishly, angrily, fearfully, are equally the objects of laughter; <lb/>
            and thus the origin of it is doubtful, as laughter is not far from <note type="footnote"> * See i. 46. </note><note type="footnote"> + The text has hoc semper humile. Burmann says that we should <lb/>

            derision. * 8. Cicero has said † that it has its seat in some de­ <lb/>
            formity or offensiveness, and if this is made to appear in others, <lb/>
            the result is called raillery, but if what we say recoils on our­ <lb/>
            selves, it is but folly.</p>
          <p>Though laughter may appear, however, a light thing, as it is <lb/>
            often excited by buffoons, mimics, and even fools, yet it has <lb/>
            power perhaps more despotic than any thing else, such as can <lb/>
            by no means be resisted. 9. It bursts forth in people even <lb/>
            against their will, and extorts a confession of its influence not <lb/>
            only from the face and the voice, but shakes the whole frame <lb/>
            with its vehemence. It often changes, too, as I said,‡ the <lb/>
            tendency of the greatest affairs, as it very frequently dissipates <lb/>
            both hatred and anger. 10. Of this the young Tarentines <lb/>
            afford an instance, who, having spoken, at a banquet, with <lb/>
            great freedom about king Pyrrhus, and being called before <lb/>
            him to account for their conduct, when the fact could neithei <lb/>
            be denied nor justified, saved themselves by a fortunate laugh <lb/>
            and jest; for one of them said, Ah! if our flagon had no. <lb/>
            failed us, we should have murdered you; and by this pleasantry <lb/>
            the whole odium of the charge was dispelled.</p>
          <p>11. But though I should not venture to say that this talent, <lb/>
            whatever it is, is certainly independent of art, (for it may be <lb/>
            cultivated by observation, and rules relating to it have been <lb/>
            composed both by Greek and Latin writers,) yet I may fairly <lb/>
            assert that it chiefly depends on nature and opportunity. <lb/>
            12. Nature, moreover, has influence in it, not only so far that <lb/>
            one man is more acute and ready than another in inventing <lb/>
            jokes, (for such facility may certainly be increased by study,) <lb/>
            but that there is in certain persons a peculiar grace in their <lb/>
            manner and look, so that the same things that they say, would, <lb/>
            if another were to say them, appear less happy. 13. As to <lb/>
            opportunity, and circumstances, they have such effect, that not <lb/>
            only unlearned persons, but even peasants, when favoured by <lb/>
            them, make witty repartees to such as are first to address <lb/>
            them; for all facetiousness appears to greater advantage in <note type="footnote"> * A derisu non procul abest risu. He that seeks to excite laughter <lb/>

            reply than in attack. *14. It adds to the difficulty, that.thera <lb/>
            is no exercise in this department, nor any instructors in it. It <lb/>
            is true that at convivial meetings, and in the familiar inter­ <lb/>
            course of life, many jesters are to be met; but their number <lb/>
            arises from the circumstance that men improve in jesting by <lb/>
            daily practice ; the wit that suits the orator is rare, and is not <lb/>
            cultivated on its own account, but sent for practice to the <lb/>
            school of the world. 15. Yet there would be no objection to <lb/>
            subjects being invented for this exercise, so that fictitious causes <lb/>
            might be pleaded with a mixture of jesting, or particular theses <lb/>
            might be proposed to youth exclusively for such practice. <lb/>
            16. Even those very pleasantries, which are and are called <lb/>
            jokes,t and in which we are accustomed to indulge on certain <lb/>
            days of festal licence,‡ might, if they were produced with some <lb/>
            degree of method, or if some serious matter were mingled with <lb/>
            them, prove of considerable advantage to the orator; but now <lb/>
            they are merely the diversion of youth, or of people amusing <lb/>
            themselves.</p>
          <p>17. In reference to the subject of which we are treating, we <lb/>
            commonly use several words to express the same thing; but, <lb/>
            if we consider them separately, each will be found to have its <lb/>
            own peculiar signification. The term urbanity || is applied to <lb/>
            it, by which is meant, I observe, a style of speaking which ex­ <lb/>
            hibits in the choice of words, in tone, and in manner, a certain <lb/>
            taste of the city, and a tincture of erudition derived from con­ <lb/>
            versation with the learned; something, in a word, of which <lb/>
            rusticity is the reverse. 18. That that is graceful,§ which is <lb/>
            expressed with grace and agreeableness, is evident. Salt¶ <lb/>
            we understand in common conversation only as something to <lb/>
            make us laugh; but this notion is not founded in nature ; <lb/>
            though certainly whatever is to make us laugh must be salt. <lb/>
            Cicero ** says that everything salt is in the taste of the Attics, <note type="footnote">* So Cicero de Oral. ii. 56, sub fin. </note><note type="footnote"> t Dicta sunt ac vocantur.] Spalding suspects the integrity of these <lb/>
            words, but suggests no satisfactory emendation. The text of this <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.VI </note> <lb/>
            but not because the Attics were most of all people inclined to <lb/>
            laughter; and when Catullus * says of a woman, There is not <lb/>
            a grain of salt in her whole body, he does not mean that there <lb/>
            is nothing in her body to excite laughter. 19. That therefore <lb/>
            will be salt which is not insipid ;t and salt will be a natural <lb/>
            seasoning of language, which is perceived by a secret taste, as <lb/>
            food is tasted by the palate, and which enlivens discourse and <lb/>
            keeps it from becoming wearisome. As salt, too, mixed with <lb/>
            food rather liberally, but not so as to be in excess, gives it a <lb/>
            certain peculiar relish, so salt in language has a certain charm, <lb/>
            which creates in us a thirst, as it were, for hearing more. <lb/>
            20. Nor do I conceive that the facetum is confined solely to <lb/>
            that which excites laughter ; for, if such were the case, <lb/>
            Horace ‡ would not have said that “ the facetum in poetry had <lb/>
            been granted by nature to Virgil." I think it rather a term <lb/>
            for grace and a certain polished elegance; and it is in this sense <lb/>
            that Cicero in his letters § quotes these words of Brutus: Næ <lb/>
            illi pedes faceti ac deliciis ingredient; molles, “Graceful indeed <lb/>
            are her feet, and move gently and with delicacy as sAe walks ;” <lb/>
            an expression similar to that of Horace, Molle atque facetum <lb/>
            Virgilio. 21. Jest || we understand as something contrary to that <lb/>
            which is serious; for to feign, to intimidate, and to promise, <lb/>
            are sometimes modes of jesting. Dicacitas ¶ is doubtless de­ <lb/>
            rived from dico, and is common to every species of jesting, but <lb/>
            it properly signifies language that attacks a person in order to <lb/>
            raise a laugh against him. Thus they say that Demosthenes <lb/>
            was urbanus, “ witty," but deny that he was dicax, “ gifted <lb/>
            with the faculty of humorous raillery.”</p>
          <p>22. But what belongs properly to the subject of which we <lb/>
            are treating is that which excites laughter; and thus all dis­ <lb/>
            cussion on the topic is entitled by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεί γελοίου</foreign>. <lb/>
            Its primary division is the same as that of every other kind of <lb/>
            speech, as it must lie either in things or in words, 23. The <lb/>
            application of it is very simple; for we try either to make <lb/>
            others the subject of laughter, or ourselves, or something that is <note type="footnote"> * Epigr. in Quintiam et Lesbiam. </note><note type="footnote"> + Insulsum. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Sat.

            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            foreign to both. What proceeds from others we either blame, <lb/>
            or refute, or make light of, or rebut, or elude. As to what <lb/>
            concerns ourselves, we speak of it with something of ridicule, <lb/>
            and, to adopt a word of Cicero's,* utter subabsurda, “ apparent <lb/>
            absurdities ;" for the same things that, if they fell from us <lb/>
            unawares, would be silly, are thought, if we express them with <lb/>
            dissimulation, extremely humorous.t 24. The third. kind, as <lb/>
            Cicero also remarks, consists in deceiving expectation, in taking <lb/>
            words in a sense different from that in which the speaker uses <lb/>
            them, and in allusions to other things, which affect neither <lb/>
            ourselves nor others, and which I therefore call intermediate <lb/>
            or neutral.</p>
          <p>25. In the second place, we either do, or say, things <lb/>
            intended to excite a laugh. Laughter may be raised by some <lb/>
            act of humour, with a mixture, sometimes, of gravity, as <lb/>
            Marcus Caelius‡ the prætor, when the consul Isauricus broke <lb/>
            his curule chair, had another fixed with straps, as the consul <lb/>
            was said to have been once beaten with a strap by his father; <lb/>
            sometimes without due regard to decency, as in the story of <lb/>
            Cælius's box,§ which is becoming neither to an orator nor to any <lb/>
            man of proper character. 26. The same may be said of looks <lb/>
            and gestures to provoke laughter, from which there may <lb/>
            certainly be some amusement, and so much the more when <lb/>
            they do not seem to aim at raising a laugh; for nothing is <lb/>
            more silly than what is offered as witty. Gravity, however, <lb/>
            adds much to the force of jests, and the very circumstance that <lb/>
            he who utters a joke does not laugh, makes others laugh ; yet <lb/>
            sometimes a humorous look, and cast of countenance, and <note type="footnote"> * De Orate ii. 71. </note><note type="footnote"> t See a similar remark on solecisms and figures, L 5, 53. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The disputes of Cælius with Isauricus, the son, were famous. <lb/>
            What the ancients have said of them has been judiciously brought <lb/>
            together by Freinsheimius in his supplement to Livy. This practical <lb/>
            joke is related, as far as I know, by no other author besides Quintilian ; <lb/>
            though the breaking of the chair of Cælius by Isauricus, when he was <lb/>
            flattering the people with the hopes of an abolition of debts, is men­ <lb/>
            tioned by Dio Cassius, lib. xlii. The affair took place during the life <lb/>
            of Isauricus's father, who died at the age of ninety, about six years <lb/>
            afterwards. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> § See Cic. pro Gæl. c. 25—29. But to find the indecency of the <lb/>

            gesture, may be assumed, provided that certain bounds be <lb/>
            observed.</p>
          <p>27. What is said in jest, moreover, is either gay and cheer­ <lb/>
            ful, as most of the jokes of Aulus Galba ;* or malicious, as those <lb/>
            of the late Junius Bassus ;f or bitter, as those of Cassius <lb/>
            Severus;‡ or inoffensive, as those of Domitius Afer. But it <lb/>
            makes a great difference where we indulge in jests. At enter­ <lb/>
            tainments, and in common conversation, a more free kind of <lb/>
            speech is allowed to the humbler class of mankind, amusing <lb/>
            discourse to all. 28. To offend we should always be unwilling; <lb/>
            and the inclination to lose a friend rather than a joke should be <lb/>
            far from us In the very battles of the forum I should wish it <lb/>
            to be in my power to use mild words, though it is allowed <lb/>
            to speak against our opponents with contumely and bitter­ <lb/>
            ness, as it is permitted us to accuse openly, and to seek <lb/>
            the life of another according to law; but in the forum, as in <lb/>
            other places, to insult another's misfortune is thought inhuman, <lb/>
            either because the insulted party may be free from blame, or <lb/>
            because similar misfortune may fall on him who offers the in­ <lb/>
            sult. A speaker is first of all to consider, therefore, what his <lb/>
            own character is; in what sort of cause he is to speak; before <lb/>
            whom; against whom ; and what he should say. 29. Distortion <lb/>
            of features and gesture, such as is the object of laughter in buf <lb/>
            fOODS, is by no means suited to an orator. Scurrilous jests, too, <lb/>
            and such as are used in low comedy, are utterly unbecoming <lb/>
            his character. As for indecency, it should be so entirely <lb/>
            banished from his language, that there should not be the <lb/>
            slightest possible allusion to it; and if it should be imputable, <lb/>
            on any occasion, to his adversary, it is not in jest that he should <lb/>
            reproach him with it. 30. Though I should wish an orator, <lb/>
            moreover, to speak with wit, I should certainly not wish him to <lb/>
            seem to affect wit; and he must not therefore speak facetiously <lb/>
            as often as he can, but must rather lose a joke occasionally, <lb/>
            than lower his dignity. 31. No one will endure a prosecutor <lb/>
            jesting in a cause of a horrible, or a defendant in one of a piti­ <note type="footnote"> * He is mentioned by Quintilian several times in this chapter, and <lb/>

            able, nature. There are some judges also of too grave a dispo­ <lb/>
            sition to yield willingly to laughter. It will sometimes occur, <lb/>
            too, that reflections which we make on our adversary may <lb/>
            apply to the judge, or even to our own client. 32. Some orators <lb/>
            have been found indeed, who would not lose a jest that might <lb/>
            recoil even on themselves; as was the case with Sulpicius <lb/>
            Longus,* who, though he was himself an ugly man, remarked <lb/>
            that a person, against whom he appeared on a trial for his right <lb/>
            to freedom,t had not even the face of a free man; when Do­ <lb/>
            mitius Afer, in reply to him, said, On your conscience, Longus, <lb/>
            do you think that he who has an ugly face cannot be a free <lb/>
            man?</p>
          <p>33. We must take care, also, that what we say of this sort <lb/>
            may not appear petulant, insulting, unsuitable to the place <lb/>
            and time, or premeditated and brought from our study. As <lb/>
            to jests on the unfortunate, they are, as I said above, unfeeling. <lb/>
            Some persons, too, are of such established authority, and such <lb/>
            known respectability, that insolence in addressing them could <lb/>
            not but hurt ourselves. 34. Regarding our friends a remark <lb/>
            has already been made ; and it concerns the good sense, not <lb/>
            merely of an orator, but of every reasonable being, not to <lb/>
            assail ‡ in this way one whom it is dangerous to offend, lest <lb/>
            bitter enmity, or humiliating satisfaction, be the consequence. <lb/>
            Raillery is also indulged injudiciously that applies to many; <lb/>
            if, for example, whole nations, or orders, or conditions, or <lb/>
            professions, be attacked by it. Whatever a good man says, <lb/>
            he will say with dignity and decency; for the price of a laugh <lb/>
            is too high, if it is raised at the expense of propriety.</p>
          <p>35. Whence laughter may be fairly excited, and from what <lb/>
            topics it is generally drawn, it is very difficult to say; for if <lb/>
            we would go through all the species of subjects for it, we <note type="footnote"> * Of him I have nothing to say. No one of that name mentioned <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VI </note> <lb/>
            should find no end, and should labour in vain. 36. For the <lb/>
            topics from which jests may be elicited, are not less numerous <lb/>
            than those from which what we call thoughts may be derived,. <lb/>
            nor are they of a different nature, since in jocularity also there <lb/>
            is invention and expression, and a display of the force of elo­ <lb/>
            quence, as consisting partly in the choice of words, and partly <lb/>
            in the use of figures of speech. 37. But I may say in general <lb/>
            that laughter is educed either from corporeal peculiarities in <lb/>
            him against whom we speak, or from his state of mind, as <lb/>
            collected from his actions and words, or from exterior circum­ <lb/>
            stances relating to him; for under these three heads fall all <lb/>
            kinds of animadversion, which, if applied severely, is of a <lb/>
            serious, if lightly, of a ludicrous character. Such subjects <lb/>
            for jests are either pointed out to the eye, or related in words, <lb/>
            or indicated by some happy remark. 38. But an opportunity <lb/>
            rarely offers of bringing them before the eye, as Lucius Julius <lb/>
            did. who having said to Helvius Mancia,t when he was <lb/>
            repeatedly clamouring against him, I will now show what you <lb/>
            are like, and Mancia persisting, and asking him to show him <lb/>
            what he was like, he pointed with his finger to the figure of <lb/>
            a Gaul painted on a Cimbrian shield, which Mancia was <lb/>
            acknowledged exactly to resemble; there were shops round the <lb/>
            forum, and the shield was hung over one of them as a sign.</p>
          <p>39. To relate a jocular story is, eminently ingenious, and <lb/>
            suitable to an orator; as Cicero in his speech for Cluentius ‡ <lb/>
            tells a story about Cepasius and Fabricius, and Marcus Cælius <lb/>
            that of the contention of Decimus § Lælius and his colleague <lb/>
            when they were hastening into their province. But in all <lb/>
            such recitals elegance and grace of statement is necessary, <lb/>
            and what the orator adds of his own should be the most <lb/>
            humorous part of it. 40. So the retirement of Fabricius <lb/>
            from the court is thus set off by Cicero: || When Cepasius, <lb/>
            therefore, thought that he was speaking with the utmost sk ll, <note type="footnote"> * See b. viii. c. 5; also Cicero de Orat. ii. 61. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero do Orat, ii. 66. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ C. 21. </note><note type="footnote"> § Some editors read Caius Lælius, “who,” says Burmann, “was <lb/>

            which of them should have the province of Syracuse or Libybæum ; as <lb/>

            and had drawn forth those solemn words from the innermost <lb/>
            stores of his art, Look on the old age of Caius Fabricius. <lb/>
            when, I say, he had, to embellish his speech, repeated the word <lb/>
            look several times, he himself looked, but Fabricius had gone off <lb/>
            from his seat with his head hanging down, and what he adds <lb/>
            besides, (for the passage is well known,) when there is nothing in <lb/>
            reality told but that Fabricius left the court. 41. Cælius also has <lb/>
            invented every circumstance of his narrative most happily, and <lb/>
            especially the last: How he, in following, crossed over, whether <lb/>
            in a ship, or a fisherman's boat, nobody knew; but the Sicilians, <lb/>
            a lively and jocular sort of people, said that he took his seat on <lb/>
            a dolphin, and sailed across like another Arion.</p>
          <p>42. Cicero. thinks that humour is shown in recital, and jocu­ <lb/>
            larity in smart attacks or defences. Domitius Afer showed <lb/>
            extraordinary wit in narration; and many stories of this kind <lb/>
            tire to be found in his speeches; but books of his shorter <lb/>
            witticisms have also been published. 43. Raillery may also be <lb/>
            displayed not in mere shooting of words, as it were, and short <lb/>
            efforts of wit, but in longer portions of a pleading, as that <lb/>
            which Cicero relates of Crassus against Brutus in his second <lb/>
            book Do Oratore,† and in some other passages. ‡ 44. When <lb/>
            Brutus, in accusing Cneius Plancus, had shown, by the mouths <lb/>
            of two readers, that Lucius Crassus, the advocate of Plancus, <lb/>
            had recommended, in his speech on the colony of Narbonne, <lb/>
            measures contrary to those which he had proposed in speaking <lb/>
            on the Servilian law, Crassus on his part called up three <lb/>
            readers, to whom he gave the Dialogues of Brutus's father to <lb/>
            read, and as one of those dialogues contained a discourse held <lb/>
            on his estate at Privernum, another on that at Alba, and <lb/>
            another on that at Tibur, he asked Brutus where all those <lb/>
            lands were. But Brutus had sold them all, and, for having <lb/>
            made away with his father's estates, was considered to have <lb/>
            dishonoured himself. Similar gratification from narrative <lb/>
            attends on the repetition of apologues, and sometimes on <lb/>
            historical anecdotes.</p>
          <p>45. But the brevity observed in jocular sayings has some­ <note type="footnote"> * Orat. c. 26. </note><note type="footnote"> t C. 55. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The commentators refer to Pro Cluent. a. 51. Whether the story <lb/>

            thing more of point and liveliness. It may be employed in <lb/>
            two ways, in attack or in reply; and the nature of the two is <lb/>
            in a great degree the same; for nothing can be said in <lb/>
            aggression that may not also be said in retort. 46. Yet there <lb/>
            are some points that seem to belong more peculiarly to reply. <lb/>
            What is said in attack, those who are heated with anger. often <lb/>
            utter; what is said in rejoinder, is generally produced in <lb/>
            a dispute, or in examining witnesses. But as there are innu­ <lb/>
            merable topics from which jokes may be drawn, I must repeat <lb/>
            that they are not all suitable for the orator. 47. In the <lb/>
            first place, those obscure jokes do not become him, which <lb/>
            depend on double meanings, and are captious as the jests of <lb/>
            an Atellan farce ;f nor such as are uttered by the lowest class <lb/>
            of people, and which out of ambiguity produce obloquy; nor <lb/>
            even such as sometimes fell from Cicero, though not in his <lb/>
            pleadings, as when he said, for instance, on occasion of a <lb/>
            candidate for office, who was reported to be the son of a cook, <lb/>
            soliciting a vote from another person in his presence, Ego <lb/>

            meanings are to be excluded from our speech, but because <lb/>
            they rarely have a good effect unless when they are well <lb/>
            supported by the matter. Of which sort § there is not only <lb/>

            Clodius should leave his villa, and asked several times when <lb/>
            Clodius was killed, Cicero replied, Late; a repartee which is <lb/>
            alone sufficient to prevent this sort of jests from being wholly <lb/>
            rejected. 50. Nor do ambiguous words only signify more <lb/>
            things than one, but even things of the most opposite nature; <lb/>
            as Nero said of a dishonest slave, That no one was more <lb/>
            trusted in his house; that nothing was shut or sealed up from <lb/>
            him.*</p>
          <p>5 1. Such ambiguity may be carried so far as to be even enig­ <lb/>
            matical; as in the jest of Cicero on Pletorius, the accuser <lb/>
            of Fonteius,† whose mother, he said, had had a school while she <lb/>
            was alive, and masters after she was dead; the truth was, that <lb/>
            women of bad character were said to have frequented her house <lb/>
            while she was alive, and that her goods were sold after her <lb/>
            death ; so that school is here used metaphorically, and masters <lb/>
            ambiguously. ‡</p>
          <p>52 This kind of jest often falls into metalepsis;§ as Fabius <lb/>
            Maximus,|| remarking on the smallness of the presents which <lb/>
            were given by Augustus to his friends, said that his congiaria <lb/>
            were heminaria, congiarium signifying both a gratuity and a <lb/>
            measure, and the word heminarium being employed to show <lb/>
            the littleness of the gratuities.1f 53. This sort of jest is as poor <lb/>
            as is the play upon names, by adding, taking away, or altering <lb/>
            letters; as I have seen, for instance, a man named Acisculus <lb/>
            called Pacisculus,** because of some bargain that he had made; <note type="footnote"> * Cicero de Orat. ii. 61. But the words Nulli plus apud se fidei <lb/>

            his temper; and Tullius, because he was a thief, called <lb/>
            Tollius.* 54. But pleasantries of this nature succeed better <lb/>
            in allusions to things than to names, Thus Domitius Afer <lb/>
            very happily said of Manlius Sum, who, while he was pleading, <lb/>
            darted to and fro, leaped up, tossed about his hands, and let <lb/>
            fall and re-adjusted his toga, Non agere Bed satagere, that " he <lb/>
            was not merely doing business in the pleading, but over-doing <lb/>
            it." The employment of the word satagere is a very good joke <lb/>
            in itself, though there was no resemblance to any other word. <lb/>
            55. Such jests are made by adding or taking away an aspirate, <lb/>
            or by joining two words together; modes in general equally <lb/>
            poor, but sometimes passable. Similar, too, is the nature of <lb/>
            all jokes that are made upon names; many of which are re­ <lb/>
            peated, as the conceits of others, by Cicero against Verres ; in <lb/>
            one place, that, as he was called Verves, he was destined <lb/>
            verrere omnia, " to sweep away everything ;"† in another, <lb/>
            that being Verres, a, a boar-pig," he had been more troublesome <lb/>
            to Hercules, whose temple he had pillaged, than the boar of <lb/>
            Erymanthus;: in another, that he was a bad Sacerdos who had <lb/>
            left so vicious a Verres; because Verres had been the successor <lb/>
            of Sacerdos.§ 56. Fortune, however, sometimes affords an op­ <lb/>
            portunity of indulging happily in a jest of this kind ; as Cicero, <lb/>
            in his speech for Cæcina,|| remarked upon a witness named <lb/>
            Sextus Clodius Phormio, that he was not less black, or less bold, <lb/>
            than the Phormio of Terence.</p>
          <p>57. But jests which are derived from peculiarities in things <lb/>
            are more spirited and elegant. Resemblances are most condu­ <lb/>
            cive to the production of them, especially if the allusion be to <lb/>
            something meaner and of less consideration; a sort of plea­ <lb/>
            santry to which the ancients were attached, who called Len­ <note type="footnote"> * From toUo, to take away. </note><note type="footnote"> + Spalding observes that the reader will in vain seek for this witti­ <lb/>
            cism in the pleadings against Verres, though something of a similar <lb/>
            nature occurs, ii. 21, and iv. 24, 25; that Quintilian may have learned <lb/>
            it from some other quarter, and have imagined that he had seen it in <lb/>
            Cicero; and that the allusion is to the second person singular of the <lb/>

            taken not only from human beings, but from other animals; <lb/>
            thus, when I was young, Junius Bassus, a man of extraordinary <lb/>
            jocularity, was called a white ass;‡ and Sarmentus,§ or Publius <lb/>
            Blessus, called Junius, a black man, lean and crook-backed, <lb/>
            an iron clasp.|| This mode of exciting laughter is now very <lb/>
            common. 59. Such comparisons are sometimes made undis­ <lb/>
            guisedly, and sometimes insinuated in the way of inference. <lb/>
            Of the former sort is the remark of Augustus, who, when a <lb/>
            soldier was timidly holding out a memorial to him, said, Do <lb/>
            not shrink back, as if you were offering a piece of money to an <lb/>
            elephant. 60. Jokes sometimes rest on some fanciful compa­ <lb/>
            rison : as that which Vatinius made, when, being on his trial, <lb/>
            and Calvus pleading against him, he wiped his forehead with <lb/>
            a white handkerchief, and the accuser made the circumstance <lb/>
            the subject of a reflection on him, Although I lie under an ac­ <lb/>
            cusation, returned Vatinius, I eat white bread.¶ 61. An ap­ <lb/>
            plication of one thing to another, from some similarity between <lb/>
            them, is still more ingenious; as when we adapt, as it were, <lb/>
            to one purpose, that which is intended for another. This may <lb/>
            very well be called an imagination; as, for instance, when, at <lb/>
            one of Cæsar's triumphs, models in ivory of the towns which <lb/>
            he had taken were carried in procession, and, a few days after, <lb/>
            at a triumph of Fabius Maximus,** models in wood of those <lb/>
            which Fabius had taken were exhibited, Chrysippustt observed <note type="footnote"> * From his resemblance to an inferior actor of that name. Val. <lb/>

            mirmillo, who was pursuing a retiarius, but did not strike him, <lb/>
            He wishes to take him alive. 62. Similitude is united with <lb/>
            ambiguity; as Aulus Galba said to a player at ball who was <lb/>
            standing to catch the ball very much at his ease, You stand as <lb/>
            if you were one of Cæsar's candidates;t for in the word "stand" <lb/>
            there is ambiguity; the " ease " is similar in both cases. This <lb/>
            it is sufficient to have noticed. 63. But there is very fre­ <lb/>
            quently a mixture of different kinds of pleasantry; and that <lb/>
            indeed is the best which is the most varied.</p>
          <p>A like use may be made of things that are dissimilar. A <lb/>
            Roman knight, to whom, as he was drinking at the public <lb/>
            games,‡ Augustus had sent an attendant with the message, If <lb/>
            I wish to dine, I retire to my house, replied, You, Augustus, are <lb/>
            not afraid of losing your place. 64. From contraries § there <lb/>
            are many kinds of jokes. It was not the same sort of jest <lb/>
            with which Augustus addressed an officer whom he dismissed <lb/>
            with dishonour, and who tried several times to move him with <lb/>
            entreaties, saying, " What shall I tell my father ?" Tell hint. <lb/>
            said the emperor, that I have displeased you, as that with which <lb/>
            Galba ¶ replied to a person who asked him for the loan of a <note type="footnote"> Vettius, the freedman of Cyrus, and an architect, as he appears to <lb/>

            thing contrary to that was looked for. Of similar origin, <lb/>
            though different from any of the preceding, is the observation <lb/>
            of Marcus Vestinius, when he was told that some nasty fellow <lb/>
            was dead, He will then at length, said he, cease to stink.* <lb/>
            65. But I should overload my book with examples, and make it <lb/>
            similar to such as are composed to excite laughter, if 1 should <lb/>
            go through all the sorts of jests uttered by the ancients.</p>
          <p>From all modes of argument, there is the same facility for <lb/>
            extracting jokes. Thus Augustus, in speaking of two actors <lb/>
            in pantomime, who vied with each other in gesticulation, em­ <lb/>
            ployed definition, calling the one a dancer, and the other an <lb/>
            interrupter of dancing.† 66. Galba used distinction, when he <lb/>
            replied to one who asked him for his cloak, You cannot <lb/>
            have it, for, if it does not rain, you will not want it, and, <lb/>
            if it does rain, I shall wear it myself. From genus, <lb/>
            species, peculiarities, differences, connexions,‡ adjuncts, conse­ <lb/>
            quents, antecedents, contrarieties, causes, effects, comparisons of <lb/>
            things equal, greater, and less, similar matter for jesting is ex­ <lb/>
            tracted. 67. It is found, too, in all the figures of speech. <lb/>
            Are not many jokes made <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαθ' ὐπεςβολήν</foreign>, by the aid of hyper­ <lb/>
            bole ? Cicero gives us one example, in reference to a very tall <lb/>
            man, that he had struck his head against the arch of Fabius ;§ <lb/>
            and another is afforded in what Oppius said of the family of <lb/>
            the Lentuli, of which the children were invariably shorter than <lb/>
            their parents, that it would by propagation come to nothing. <lb/>

            says Spalding, was such a dancer as he ought to have been; the other <lb/>
            a mere spoiler of dancing. But we do not see the point of the joke. <lb/>
            Perhaps interpellatorem is corrupt. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Jugatis.] See v. 10, 85. </note><note type="footnote"> § Cicero de Oral ii. 66. But the joke is there attributed to Crassus. <lb/>

            Spalding supposes that Quintilian was misled by his imagination. The <lb/>

            gravely, a species of joking ? Domitius Afer used it very hap­ <lb/>
            pily, when he said to Didius Gallus, who had made great <lb/>
            solicitations for a province, and, after obtaining it, complained <lb/>
            as if he were forced to accept it. Well, do something for the saks <lb/>
            of the commonwealth.. Cicero, too, employed it very sportively, <lb/>
            on a report of the death of Vatinius, for which the authority <lb/>
            was said to be far from certain, In the meantime, said he, I <lb/>
            will enjoy the interest.† 69 Cicero used also to say, allegori­ <lb/>
            cally, of Marcus Cælius, who was better at accusing than <lb/>
            defending, that he had a good right-hand, but a bad left.‡ <lb/>
            Julius used the antonomasia, when he said Ferrum Accium <lb/>
            Nævium incidisse.§</p>
          <p>70. Jocularity also admits allfigures of thought, called by the <lb/>
            Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭχήματα διανοίας</foreign>, under which some have ranked the <lb/>
            various species of jests; for we ask questions, and express doubt, <lb/>
            and affirm, and threaten, and wish; and we make some remarks <lb/>
            as if in compassion, and others with anger. But everything is <lb/>
            jocular that is evidently pretended.</p>
          <p>71. To laugh at foolish remarks is very easy; for they are <lb/>
            ridiculous in themselves; but some addition of our own in­ <lb/>
            creases the wit. Titus Maximus foolishly asked Carpathius as <lb/>
            he was going out of the theatre, Whether he had seen the play; <lb/>
            when Carpathius made the question appear more ridiculous <lb/>
            by replying, No, for I was playing at ball in the orchestra.</p>
          <p>72. Refutation admits of jesting either in the form of de­ <lb/>
            nial, retort, defence, or extenuation. Manius Curius made a <lb/>
            good repartee by way of denial; for when his accuser had had <lb/>
            him painted on a curtain,|| everywhere either stripped and <lb/>

            his friends, Was I, then, he replied, never successful ? 73. Retort <lb/>
            we use sometimes undisguisedly, as Cicero in reply to Vibius <lb/>
            Curius, who was telling falsehood concerning his age, said, <lb/>
            Then, when we declaimed in the schools together, you were not <lb/>
            born; sometimes with feigned assent, as the same orator said to <lb/>
            Fabia, Dolabella's wife, who observed that she was thirty years <lb/>
            old, No doubt, for I have heard you say so these twenty years. <lb/>
            74. Sometimes in place of what you deny, something more <lb/>
            cutting is happily substituted: as Junius Bassus, when Do­ <lb/>
            mitis, the wife. of Passienus, complained that he had said, <lb/>
            as a charge of meanness against her, that she used to sell old <lb/>
            shoes, replied, No, indeed, I never said any such thing; I said <lb/>
            that you used to buy them. A defence a Roman knight made <lb/>
            with some humour, replying to Augustus, who reproached him <lb/>
            with having eaten up his patrimony, I thought it was my own.</p>
          <p>75. Of extenuation there are two modes; a person may <lb/>
            make light of another's claims to indulgence,! or of some <lb/>
            boast that be utters. Thus Caius Cæsar ‡ said to Pomponius, <lb/>
            who was showing a wound which he had received in his mouth <lb/>
            in the sedition of Sulpicius, and which he boasted that he had <lb/>
            received in fighting for Cæsar, When you are fleeing, never look <lb/>
            back. Or it may extenuate some fault imputed to us, as Cicero <lb/>
            said to those who reproached him with having at sixty years of <lb/>
            age married Publilia § a virgin, To-morrow she wiU be a woman. <lb/>
            76. Some call this kind of jest consequent, and similar to that <lb/>
            of Cicero when he said that Curio, who always began his <lb/>
            pleadings with an excuse for his age, would find his exordium <lb/>
            every day more easy, because the reply seems naturally to follow <lb/>
            and attach itself to the remark. 77. But one kind of extenu­ <lb/>
            ation is a suggestion of a reason, such as Cicero gave to <lb/>

            how often you make a fire on it. 78. Cassius Severus trans. <lb/>
            ferrod* a charge from himself to others; for when he was <lb/>
            reproached by the prætor that his advocates had insulted <lb/>
            Lucius Varus an Epicurean, a friend of Caesar, he replied, 1 <lb/>
            do not know what sort of characters committed the insult, but <lb/>
            suppose that they must have been Stoics.</p>
          <p>Of rebutting a jest there are many ways; the most happy <lb/>
            is that which is aided by some resemblance in the words, as <lb/>
            Trachalus, when Suellius said to him, If this is so, you go into <lb/>
            exile, replied, And if it is not so, you return into exile. <lb/>
            79. Cassius Severus, when a person made it a charge against <lb/>
            him that Proculeius had forbidden him his house, eluded the <lb/>
            charge by replying, Do I ever then go to Proculeiuss house ? <lb/>
            Thus one jest is eluded by another; as the Emperor Augustus, <lb/>
            when the Gauls had made him a present of a collar of a <lb/>
            hundred pounds weight, and Dolabella had said in jest, though <lb/>
            with some solicitude as to the event of the jest, Distinguish <lb/>
            me. General, with the honour of the collar, replied, I had rather <lb/>
            distinguish you with the honour of a civic crown 80. and one <lb/>
            falsehood may also be eluded by another; as when a person <lb/>
            said in the hearing of Galba that he had bought in Sicily for <lb/>
            one victoriatus ‡ a lamprey five feet long, Galba rejoined that <lb/>
            it was not at all surprising, as they grew so long there that the <lb/>
            fishermen used them for ropes. 81. Opposed to the negative <lb/>
            is the pretence of confession, which also has much wit. Thus <lb/>
            Domitius Afer, when he was pleading against a freedman of <lb/>
            Claudius Cæsar, and a person of the same condition as the <lb/>
            party against whom he was pleading called out from the <lb/>
            opposite side of the court, Do you then always speak against <lb/>
            the freedmen of Cæsar ? replied, Always, and yet, by Hercules, <lb/>
            I produce no effect. § Similar to confession is not to deny what <lb/>
            is alleged, though it be evidently false, and though opportunity <lb/>
            for an excellent answer be suggested by it; as Catulus, when <lb/>
            Philippus said to him, Why do you bark? replied, Because <note type="footnote"> * Transtulit.] See on translatio, or " exception," iii. 6, 23. </note><note type="footnote"> t Which was made of oak leaves. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ A small coin, the half of a denarius, about 3¾d. of our money.

            I see a thief* 82. To joke upon one's self, is, I may say, the <lb/>
            part only of a buffoon, and is by no means allowable in an orator. <lb/>
            It may be done in as many ways as we joke upon others: <lb/>
            therefore, though it be too common, I pass it over. 83. What­ <lb/>
            ever, moreover, is expressed scurrilously or passionately, is, <lb/>
            though it may raise a laugh, unworthy of a man of respeo <lb/>
            lability. Thus I know a man who said to an inferior person, <lb/>
            that had addressed him with too little respect, I will inflict a <lb/>
            blow on your head, and bring an action against you for hurting <lb/>
            my hand by the hardness of your head.t At such a saying <lb/>
            it is doubtful whether the hearers ought to laugh or feel <lb/>
            indignation.</p>
          <p>84. There remains to be noticed the kind of joke that <lb/>
            consists in deceiving expectation,‡ or taking the words of <lb/>
            another in a sense different from that in which he uses them ; <lb/>
            and of all sorts of jests these may be said to be the happiest. <lb/>
            But an unexpected turn may be adopted even by one who <lb/>
            attacks; such as that of which Cicero gives an example: <lb/>
            What is wanting to this man except fortune and virtue ? Or <lb/>
            as that of Domitius Afer: For pleading causes he is a man <lb/>
            excellently apparelled.§ Or it may be used in anticipating <lb/>
            the answer of another person. Thus Cicero,|| on hearing a <lb/>
            false report of the death of Vatinius, asked his freedman <lb/>
            Ovinius, Is all well ? and, when he said All is well, rejoined, <lb/>
            He is then dead ? 85. Great laughter attends on simulation <lb/>
            and dissimulation, which may be thought similar and almost <lb/>
            the same, but simulation is the act of one who pretends to feel <lb/>
            a certain persuasion in his mind; dissimulation that of one who <lb/>
            feigns not to understand another's meaning. Domitius Afer <lb/>
            used simulation, when, on some persons reiterating at a trial that <lb/>
            Celsina knew the facts, (who was a woman of some influence,) <lb/>
            he asked, Who is he? wishing to make it appear that he <lb/>
            thought Celsina a man. 86. Cicero used dissimulation when <lb/>
            a witness, named Sextus Annalis, had given testimony against <lb/>
            a person whom he was defending, and the prosecutor several <note type="footnote"> * Cicero de Orat. ii. 54. </note><note type="footnote"> † I interpret this jest according to the conception of Burmann. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See ix. % 22; Cicero de Orate ii. 70. </note><note type="footnote"> § Optimè vestitus.] Vestitus instead of exercitatu, versatus, or parat us <lb/>

            times pressed him, crying, Tell uUS, Marcus Cicero, whether you <lb/>
            can say anything of Sextus Annalis; Cicero immediately began <lb/>
            to recite from the sixth book of the Annals of Ennius,* <lb/>
            Quis potis ingentis causas evolvere belli ? <lb/>
            Who can the cause of this great war disclose ! <lb/>
            87. For this kind of jest ambiguity doubtless affords the most <lb/>
            frequent opportunity; as it did to Cascellius,† who, when a <lb/>
            person consulting him said, I wish to divide my ship,‡ rejoined, <lb/>
            You wiU lose it then. But the thoughts are often sent in <lb/>
            another direction, by a remark being turned off from something <lb/>
            of greater to something of less consequence; as when the <lb/>
            person who was asked what he thought of a man caught in <lb/>
            adultery, replied that he was slow.§ 88. Of a similar nature <lb/>
            is that which is said in such a manner as to convey a suspicion <lb/>
            of the meaning; as in an example to be found in Cicero.|| <lb/>
            When a man was lamenting that his wife had hung herself on <lb/>
            a fig-tree, I beg you, said another to him, to give me a slip of <lb/>
            that tree, that I may plant it; for the meaning, though not <lb/>
            expressed, is very well understood. 89. Indeed all facetious­ <lb/>
            ness lies in expressing things with some deviation from the <lb/>
            natural and genuine sense of the words employed and this <lb/>
            is wholly done by misrepresenting our own or other people's <lb/>
            thoughts, or by stating something that cannot be. DO. Juba** <lb/>
            misrepresented the thought of another, when he said to a man <lb/>

            said he, for there are people under the table supping upon the <lb/>
            same dish. Of the same sort is the jest of Cicero on Curius, <lb/>
            which I have just mentioned,t for it was impossible that he <lb/>
            should not have been born when he was declaiming. 91. There <lb/>
            is a certain misrepresentation, too, that has its origin in irony, <lb/>
            of which Caius Caesar ‡ gives us an example; fcr when a <lb/>
            witness said that his groin had been wounded by the accused <lb/>
            person, and it was easy to show why he had wished to wound <lb/>
            that part of his body rather than any other, Cæsar preferred <lb/>
            to say, What could he do, when you had a helmet and a coat oj <lb/>
            mail? § 92. But the best of all simulation is that which is <lb/>
            directed against one who simulates, such as that which was <lb/>
            employed in the following instance by Domitius Afer: He had <lb/>
            by him a will which had been made some time, and a man <lb/>
            whom he had taken into his friendship since the date of it, <lb/>
            hoping to gain something if he should alter it, told him a story <lb/>
            of his own invention, for the purpose of asking him whether <lb/>
            he should advise an old chief centurion,|| who had already <lb/>
            made his will, to make another,¶ By no means do so, said <lb/>
            Domitius, for you will offend him.</p>

            such as are good-natured, and, so to speak, easy of digestion ; <lb/>
            such as that which the same orator once addressed to an un­ <lb/>
            grateful client, who avoided recognition from him one day in <lb/>
            the forum; he sent this message to him by an attendant: <lb/>
            Are you not obliged to me for not having seen you ? Or as that <lb/>

            pleasing sort of jest, too, that lays less to the charge of another <lb/>
            than might be laid ; thus when a candidate for office applied to <lb/>

            when uttered as an attack upon him to his face, a mere sub­ <lb/>
            ject for laughter. 95. Such was the remark of Augustus, <lb/>
            when a soldier was requesting something unreasonable of him, <lb/>
            and Marcianus, whom he suspected of intending to ask of him <lb/>
            something unjust, came up at the time: I will no more do <lb/>
            what you ask, comrade, said he to the soldier, than I will do <lb/>
            that which Marcianus is going to ast. 96. Verses also, aptly <lb/>
            quoted, have given great effect to witticisms, whether introduced <lb/>
            entire and just as they are, (a thing so easy, that Ovid has <lb/>
            composed a book against bad poets in verses taken from the <lb/>
            Tetrastichs of Macer,‡) and this mode of citation is the more <lb/>
            agreeable if it be seasoned with something of ambiguity, as in <lb/>
            Cicero's remark upon Marcius,§ a man of much cunning and <lb/>
            artifice, when he was suspected of unfair dealing in a cause, <lb/>

            jested on a senator, who, having been always thought extremely <lb/>
            foolish, was, after inheriting an estate, called upon first to give <lb/>

          <p>To take a jest from history shows learning; as Cicero did, on <lb/>
            the trial of Verres; for when he was examining a witness, <lb/>
            Hortensius observed, "I do not understand these enigmas;" <lb/>
            But you ought, replied Cicero, as you have a Sphinx at home ; <lb/>
            for he had received from Verres a brazen Sphinx of great <lb/>
            value.</p>
          <p>99. As to apparent absurdities,t they consist in an imitation of <lb/>
            foolish sayings, and would, if they were not affected, be foolish; <lb/>
            as that of the man who, when the people expressed their <lb/>
            wonder that he had bought a low candlestick, said to them, <lb/>
            It will serve me for breakfast.‡ But some that are very like <lb/>
            absurdities, and that seem to be said without any reason at all, <lb/>
            are extremely pointed; as when the slave of Dolabella was <lb/>
            asked whether his master had advertised a sale of his property, <lb/>
            he replied, He has sold his house.§ 100. Persons taken by sur­ <lb/>
            prise sometimes get rid of their embarrassment by a jest. Thus <lb/>
            when an advocate asked a witness who said that he had been <lb/>
            wounded by the person on trial, "whether he had a scar to <lb/>
            show," and the witness showed a large one on his groin, He <lb/>
            ought, observed the advocate, to have aimed at your side.|| It <lb/>
            is also possible to use insulting expressions happily; as Hispo, <lb/>
            when his accuser twice imputed heinous crimes to him, replied, <note type="footnote"> * Compare Hor. Epist. i. 17, 62. </note><note type="footnote"> + See sect. 43. </note><note type="footnote"> t Pransoriam, erit.] Prandia. similar to our breakfasts, required <lb/>

            unsatisfactory, nevertheless necessary.</p>
          <p>To these Domitius Marsus, who wrote a very carefully <lb/>
            studied treatise on Urbanitas, " urbanity," adds some exam­ <lb/>
            ples of sayings that are not laughable, but admissible even <lb/>
            into the gravest speeches; they are elegantly expressed, and <lb/>
            rendered agreeable by a certain peculiar kind of wit; they are <lb/>
            indeed urbana, " urbane," or " polished," but have nothing <lb/>
            to do with the ridiculous. 103. Nor was his work intended <lb/>
            to treat of laughter, but of urbanitas, which, he says, is pe­ <lb/>
            culiar to our city, and was not at all understood till a late <lb/>
            period, after it became common for the term urbs, though the <lb/>
            proper name was not added, to be taken as signifying Rome <lb/>
            104. He thus defines it: ‡ " Urbanitas is a certain power of <lb/>
            thought, comprised in' a concise form of expression, and <lb/>
            adapted to please and excite mankind, with reference to every <lb/>
            variety of feeling, being especially fitted either to repel or to <lb/>
            attack, as circumstances or persons may render necessary." <lb/>
            But this definition, if we take from it the particular of con­ <lb/>
            ciseness, may be considered as embracing all the excellences <lb/>
            of language; for, if it concerns things and persons, to say <lb/>
            what property applies to each of them is the part of consum­ <lb/>
            mate eloquence; and why he made it a necessary condition <lb/>
            that it should be concise, I do not know.</p>
          <p>105. But, in the same book, a little farther on, he defines <lb/>
            another kind of urbanitas, peculiar to narrative, (which has <note type="footnote"> * In these two repartees no wit is to be discovered; the text is <lb/>
            probably corrupt or defective; " but," says Spalding, " I had rather <lb/>
            abstain from attempting emendation than pretend to see in the <lb/>
            thickest darkness." </note><note type="footnote"> t Comp. sect. 35, 36. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See Quintilian's own definition sect, 17. Gesner. </note> <pb n="455"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            been displayed, he says, in many speakers,) in the following <lb/>
            manner, adhering, as he states, to the opinion of Cato: <lb/>
            " A man of urbanitas will be one from whom many good say <lb/>
            jogs and repartees shall have proceeded, and who, in common <lb/>
            conversation, at meetings, at entertainments, in assemblies of <lb/>
            the people, and, in short, everywhere, speaks with humour and <lb/>
            propriety. Whatever orator shall deliver himself in this way, <lb/>
            laughter will follow." 106. But if we receive these definitions, <lb/>
            whatever is said well, will also have the character of urbanitas. <lb/>
            To a writer who proposed such specifications, it was natural to <lb/>
            make such a division of urbane sayings as to call some serious, <lb/>
            some jocose, and others intermediate; for this division applies <lb/>
            to all properly expressed thoughts. 107. But to me, even <lb/>
            some sayings that are jocose, appear not to be expressed with <lb/>
            sufficient urbanitas, which, in my judgment, is a character of <lb/>
            oratory in which there is nothing incongruous, nothing coarse, <lb/>
            nothing unpolished, nothing barbarous to be discovered, either <lb/>
            in the thoughts, or the words, or the pronunciation, or the <lb/>
            gestures ; so that it is not to be looked for so much in words <lb/>
            considered singly, as in the whole complexion of a speech; <lb/>
            like Atticism among the Greeks, which was a delicacy of taste <lb/>
            peculiar to the city of Athens.</p>
          <p>108. Yet that I may not do injustice to the judgment of <lb/>
            Marsus, who was a very learned man, I will add that he dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishes urbanitas, as applied to serious sayings, into the <lb/>
            commendatory, the reproachful, and the intermediate. Of the <lb/>
            commendatory he gives an example from Cicero, in his speech <lb/>
            for Ligarius,* when he says to Cæsar, Thou who art wont to <lb/>
            forget nothing but injuries. 109. Of the reproachful he gives <lb/>
            as an instance what Cicero wrote to Atticust concerning Pom­ <lb/>
            pey and Cæsar: I have one whom I can avoid; one whom I <lb/>
            can follow, I have not. Of the intermediate, which he calls <lb/>
            apopthegmatic, he cites as a specimen these other words of <lb/>
            Cicero :‡ that death could never be either grievous to a brave <lb/>
            man, or premature to a man who has attained the consulship, <lb/>
            or calamitous to a wise man. All these passages are very <lb/>
            happily expressed; but why they should be peculiarly dis­ <note type="footnote"> * C. 12. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ad Att. viii. 7, with which Quintilian's words do not exactly <lb/>

            tinguished by the character of urbanitas, I do not see. 110 <lb/>
            If it is not the whole complexion of a composition, (as it ap­ <lb/>
            pears to me,) that entitles it to this distinction, and if the <lb/>
            term is to be applied to single expressions, I should rather <lb/>
            give the character of urbanitas to those sayings which are of <lb/>
            the kind called droll, but which yet are not droll, such as the <lb/>
            following: III. It was said of Asinius Pollio, who could <lb/>
            adapt himself alike either to business or to pleasure, that he <lb/>
            was a man for all hours; and of a pleader, who spoke with <lb/>
            ease extemporaneously, that he had all his Mit in ready cash. <lb/>
            Such, too, was the saying of Pompey, which Marsus notices, <lb/>
            addressed to Cicero, who expressed distrust of his party; go <lb/>
            over to Cæsar, then, and you will fear me.* Though this, if <lb/>
            it had been uttered on a less important occasion, or in another <lb/>
            spirit, or by any other person than Pompey, might have been <lb/>
            numbered among droll sayings. 112. To these may be added <lb/>
            what Cicero wrote to Cerellia,t assigning a reason why he so <lb/>
            patiently endured the proceedings of Cæsar: These things <lb/>
            must be borne, either with the mind of a Cato or with the <lb/>
            stomach of a Cicero; for the word stomach carries with it <lb/>
            something like a jest.</p>
          <p>These reflections, which struck me with regard to the <lb/>
            definitions of Marsus, I could not withhold from my readers; <lb/>
            in which, though I may have erred, I have not deceived them, <lb/>
            having pointed out at the same time a different opinion, which <lb/>
            it is free for those, who approve it, to follow.</p>

            concerning discussion* until I have treated of every particular <lb/>
            regarding continuous speaking; for recourse is had to discus­ <lb/>
            sion last of all ;† but, as it depends on invention alone, and <lb/>
            can have no concern with arrangement, nor requires any great <lb/>
            ornament from style, or much assistance from memory or <lb/>
            delivery, I think that, before I proceed to the second of the <lb/>
            five parts, I shall treat of this, which is connected wholly <lb/>
            with the first, in a not improper place, if I speak of it here. <lb/>
            2. It is a matter which other writers have neglected, perhaps <lb/>
            because sufficient regard seemed to have been paid to it in the <lb/>
            other rules of the art; for it consists either in attack or <lb/>
            defence, concerning which a considerable number of directions <lb/>
            have been given ;t since whatever is proper with regard to <lb/>
            proofs in a continued speech, must also necessarily be appli­ <lb/>
            cable to the brevity and conciseness of discussion, in which no <lb/>
            other topics are introduced than are in the rest of the <lb/>
            pleading; they are only treated in another manner, that is, <lb/>
            by way of question and answer. Almost all that is necessary <lb/>
            to be observed with respect to this head has been noticed by <lb/>
            me § in the part relating to witnesses. 3. Yet, as I am pursuing <lb/>
            this work on an extensive plan, and as an orator cannot be <lb/>
            called accomplished without ability in discussion, let me devote <lb/>
            a little particular attention to this point also, which, indeed, <lb/>
            in some causes, contributes greatly to insure success. 4. For <lb/>
            as, with regard to the general quality of an action, when it is <lb/>
            considered whether it was justly done or otherwise, continuous <lb/>
            speaking is most required, which also sufficiently sets forth, <lb/>
            for the most part, questions of definition or exception,∥ as well <lb/>
            as all those in which a fact is admitted, or inferred, by <note type="footnote"> * Altercationis.] Altercatio Is disputation consisting in answers and <lb/>

            any questions from the opposite party. There is an excellent example <lb/>

            conjecture* from artificial proof;† so in those causes, (a very <lb/>
            numerous class,) which either depend solely on proofs called <lb/>
            inartificial,t or such as are of a mixed kind, the heat of <lb/>
            discussion is frequently most fierce; nor should we say that <lb/>
            advocates point their swords at each other in any part of <lb/>
            a cause more closely than in this. 5. For the strongest <lb/>
            arguments must here be inculcated on the mind of the judge; <lb/>
            whatever we promised in the course of our pleading must be <lb/>
            made good: and the false allegations of the opposite party <lb/>
            must be refuted. There is no part of a cause, indeed, in <lb/>
            which the judge is more attentive ; and some pleaders, though <lb/>
            but of moderate power in speaking, have, by their excellence <lb/>
            in disputation, gained a just title to the name of advocates. <lb/>
            6. But some, on the other hand, satisfied with having bestowed <lb/>
            on their clients the showy labour of declamation, quit the <lb/>
            benches at the close of it, attended with a crowd of flatterers, <lb/>
            and leave to ignorant and mean practitioners § the conduct of <lb/>
            the battle which ought to decide the cause. 7. Accordingly, <lb/>
            in private causes, we may see some advocates chosen for <lb/>
            pleading and others for the establishment of proofs. But if <lb/>
            these duties are to be divided, the latter is surely of more <lb/>
            importance than the former; and it is dishonourable to oratory <lb/>
            to say that inferior pleaders profit their clients more than <lb/>
            those of greater ability. At public trials, however, the voice <lb/>
            of the crier cites him who has pleaded || as well as the other <lb/>
            advocates.</p>
          <p>8. For such disputation, then, there is need, in the first <lb/>
            place, of a quick and active intellect, and of a ready and keen <lb/>
            judgment. For we have no time to reflect, but must speak <lb/>
            at once, and aim a blow at our adversary at the same time <lb/>
            that we parry his attempt on ourselves. As it is of the <lb/>
            greatest importance, therefore, to every part of an orator's <lb/>
            duty, to know his whole cause not only accurately, but <lb/>
            familiarly, so it is of the utmost necessity, in altercation with <lb/>
            our adversary, to have a thorough knowledge of all the clia. <note type="footnote"> * Statu conjecturali I See b. iii c. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> + See b. v. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See b. v. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> § Pullatœ turbœ.] Comp. ii. 12, 10.

            racters, instruments, times, and places connected with it; <lb/>
            otherwise we shall often be put to silence, or, if others suggest <lb/>
            replies to us, we must, from necessary haste to speak, <lb/>
            unreasoningly acquiesce in what they say ; whence it will <lb/>
            sometimes happen that in trusting to others, we shall nave to <lb/>
            blush for their folly. Nor is the matter made clear by these <lb/>
            monitors.. 9. Some advocates, too, try undisguisedly to bring <lb/>
            us to a quarrel; for we may see many of them, transported <lb/>
            apparently with wrath, calling upon the judge to attend, and <lb/>
            saying that what is suggested is contrary to fact, and that he <lb/>
            who is to decide the cause should understand the evil which is <lb/>
            kept out of sight. 10. He who would be a good disputant, <lb/>
            therefore, must be free from the vice of passionateness; for <lb/>
            no affection of the mind is a greater enemy to reason; it <lb/>
            carries us out of the cause, leads us, frequently, to offer and <lb/>
            incur gross insults, sometimes draws upon us the indignation of <lb/>
            the judges themselves. Moderation is better, and sometimes <lb/>
            even sufferance; for allegations made by the opposite party <lb/>
            must not only be refuted, but must be held up to contempt, <lb/>
            must be undervalued and ridiculed; nor can wit find any <lb/>
            better place for exercise than this. Such is the case as long <lb/>
            as matters are conducted with order and due respect to us; <lb/>
            but against turbulent adversaries we must show a bold face, <lb/>
            and oppose impudence with firmness. 11. For there are <lb/>
            some speakers of such a hardened front that they assail us <lb/>
            with loud bluster, interrupt us in the middle of a speech, and <lb/>
            confuse and disturb the whole proceedings; these we must be <lb/>
            so far from imitating, that we must vigorously repel them; <lb/>
            their insolence must be put down ; and we must at times <lb/>
            appeal to the judges or presiding magistrates that the times <lb/>
            for speaking may be fairly observed. It is no task for an <lb/>
            indolent mind, or an excessively modest character; and that <lb/>
            which is called honesty often bears a false name, and should <lb/>
            rather be called imbecility.</p>
          <p>12. What is of the greatest value in disputation is acuteness, <lb/>
            which doubtless does not come from art; (since what is natural <lb/>
            is not taught;) but it may be improved by art. 13. The <lb/>
            chief requisite is, to keep the point in dispute, and that which <lb/>
            we wish to establish, constantly before our eyes ; because, if we <lb/>
            keep to one object, we shall not be led into useless altercation, <note type="footnote"> * Neque tamen hoc ipsis monitoribus clarescit.] Burmann would read <lb/>

            or waste the time due to the cause in railing; and, if our <lb/>
            adversary commit such errors, we shall have the pleasure of <lb/>
            taking advantage of them.</p>
          <p>14. To those who have meditated carefully what may be ob­ <lb/>
            jected on the opposite side, or what replies may be made on <lb/>
            their own, all occasions - may be turned to advantage. It is a <lb/>
            kind of artifice employed at times, however, to contrive that <lb/>
            certain points, which have been concealed in the course of the <lb/>
            pleading, may be suddenly brought forth in the subsequent <lb/>
            discussion; starting out as it were in an unexpected sally, or <lb/>
            a spring t from an ambush. This is a plan which may be <lb/>
            adopted when there is some particular in the cause on which <lb/>
            we cannot speak satisfactorily at once, but which we can make <lb/>
            clear when time is given us for consideration.‡ 15. What is <lb/>
            secure and solid, it will be best to bring forward at the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of our proceedings, that we may insist upon it the <lb/>
            oftener and the longer. It seems scarcely necessary to direct <lb/>
            that a disputant should not be turbulent and clamorous merely, <lb/>
            like people who are utterly strangers to learning; for audacity, <lb/>
            though it may be troublesome to the adversary, is at the same <lb/>
            time hateful to the judge. 16. It is inexpedient, too, to COil­ <lb/>
            tend long for a point which you cannot carry; for where you <lb/>
            must be conquered, it is better to yield; because, if there be <lb/>
            several points in dispute, the good faith which we show with <lb/>
            regard to one will cause us to be more trusted with respect to <lb/>
            others, or, if there be but one point, a lighter penalty may be <lb/>
            inflicted on us in consequence of a candid acknowledgment. <lb/>
            To persist in vindicating a fault, especially when it is exposed, <lb/>
            is to commit another fault.</p>
          <p>17. While the contest is undecided, there is great skill and <lb/>
            artifice in drawing on our adversary when wandering from the <lb/>
            point, and forcing him to go as far from it as possible, in such <lb/>
            a way that he may exult at times in false hopes of success. <lb/>
            Some points in our evidence may accordingly with advantage <lb/>
            be kept back; for our opponents will perhaps press for them <lb/>
            with importunity, and risk the whole of their cause on what <note type="footnote"> * Omnia tempora.] Capperonier and Spalding agree with Rollin in <lb/>

            they think that we cannot produce, adding authority to our <lb/>
            proofs by the earnestness with which they demand them. <lb/>
            18. It may be of use, too, at times, to abandon some point to <lb/>
            our adversary, which he may think in his favour, in order that, <lb/>
            while he is grasping it, he may let slip something of greater <lb/>
            importance; or to offer him his choice of two things, either of <lb/>
            which he will choose to his disadvantage; a course which may <lb/>
            be adopted with more effect in discussion than in regular <lb/>
            pleading, because in the one we reply to ourselves, and in the <lb/>
            other we convict our adversary, as it were, on his own con­ <lb/>
            fession.</p>
          <p>19. It is the part of an acute pleader to observe, above all, <lb/>
            by what remarks the judge is most impressed, and to what he <lb/>
            listens with disapprobation; a circumstance which may often <lb/>
            be discovered from his looks, and sometimes from some word <lb/>
            or gesture. He ought then to insist upon whatever promotes <lb/>
            his object, and to withdraw adroitly from whatever is preju­ <lb/>
            dicial to him. It is in such a way that physicians act; they <lb/>
            continue or cease to give medicines, just as they see that they <lb/>
            are relished or loathed by the patient. 20. Sometimes, if it <lb/>
            is not easy to make a point that we have stated clear, we may <lb/>
            raise another question, and fix the attention of the judge, if <lb/>
            possible, upon it; for when you yourself cannot answer to a <lb/>
            thing, what is to be done but to find something else to which <lb/>
            your opponent may be unable to answer? 21. In regard to <lb/>
            most parts of a disputation, as I observed,. the same is to be <lb/>
            said as in regard to the examination of witnesses, the difference <lb/>
            being only with respect to persons; as in the one case the <lb/>
            contest is between advocates, and in the other between the <lb/>
            witness and the advocate. But to exercise one's self in dispu­ <lb/>
            tation is much more easy; for it is possible, and may be of <lb/>
            the greatest advantage, to choose, in conjunction with some one <lb/>
            engaged in the same studies, a subject, either true or fictitious, <lb/>
            for discussion, and to take different sides upon it after the <lb/>
            manner of altercations in the courts; a practice which may <lb/>
            also be adopted in respect to the simple sort of questions.!</p>
          <p>22. I would also have an advocate understand in what order <lb/>
            his various proofs should be brought before the judge in <lb/>
            such disputations; and the same plan may be adopted with <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t I understand questions, theses, as distinct from causes; see v. 10, <lb/>

            regard tc them as with regard to the arguments in his speech, <lb/>
            namely, that the strongest be placed first and last; for the <lb/>

            decide in his favour.</p>

          <p>Of judgment and sagacity ; their importance, § 1—6. Examples from <lb/>
            Demosthenes, 7, 8. From Cicero, 9, 10. Conclusion of the book, 11.</p>
          <p>1. HAVING treated of this head to the best of my ability, I <lb/>
            should not hesitate to pass at once to disposition, which follows <lb/>
            next in order, were I not apprehensive that, as there are <lb/>
            writers who place judgment * under invention, I might be <lb/>
            thought. by some to have purposely omitted that subject, though <lb/>
            it is a quality, in my opinion, so blended and mixed with every <lb/>
            part of oratory that its influence is inseparable from even a <lb/>
            single thought or word; and it is not communicable by art <lb/>
            any more than taste or smell. 2. All that I can do, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, is to teach, and persevere in teaching, what is to be <lb/>
            imitated or avoided in each department of the art, in order <lb/>
            that judgment may be exercised in reference to it. I shall <lb/>
            continue to teach, therefore, that we must not attempt what <lb/>
            cannot be accomplished; that we must avoid all arguments <lb/>
            that are contradictory or common to both sides;! and that <lb/>
            nothing in our speech must be barbarous or. obscure; but the <lb/>
            observance of all such rules must be under the guidance of <lb/>
            common sense, which cannot be taught.</p>
          <p>3. From judgment I do not consider that sagacity greatly <lb/>
            differs, except that judgment is employed about things which <lb/>
            are evident in themselves, and sagacity about things that are <lb/>
            obscure, having either not been noticed at all, or being of a <lb/>
            doubtful nature. Judgment is very often sure; sagacity is <lb/>
            a certain reasoning, as it were, from the depths of things, <lb/>
            generally weighing and comparing different arguments, and <lb/>
            exercising the faculties both of invention and arbitration. 4. But <lb/>
            such observations are not to be taken as universally true; for <lb/>
            sagacity is often exercised on some circumstance that precedes <lb/>
            the pleading of a cause; as Cicero, in pleading against Verres, <note type="footnote"> * See iii. 3, 5, 6. </note><note type="footnote"> t Communia.] See iii. 3. 5. </note> <pb n="463"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V] </note> <lb/>
            appears with great sagacity to have preferred occupying a <lb/>
            shorter time with his speech to prolonging it to the year in <lb/>
            which Quintus Hortensius was to be consul.* 5. In the <lb/>
            conduct of a pleading, sagacity holds the first and most influ­ <lb/>
            ential place ; for it is required to determine what we ought to <lb/>
            say, what to suppress, and what to defer; whether it be better <lb/>
            to deny a fact, or to justify it; when we should use an <lb/>
            exordium, and of what kind; whether we should give a state­ <lb/>
            ment of facts, and in what form ; whether we should rest out <lb/>
            case on law or on equity; what order is the most eligible; <lb/>
            what style we should adopt, and whether it be expedient to <lb/>
            speak boldly, gently, or humbly. 6. But upon these points I <lb/>
            have already, as occasion has allowed, given some directions, <lb/>
            and I shall continue to do so in the rest of my work. I will <lb/>
            make a few remarks here, however, by way of example, that it <lb/>
            may be more clearly understood what it is that I think cannot <lb/>
            be taught by rules of art. 7. The sagacity of Demosthenes is <lb/>
            commended in this respect, that, when he was recommending <lb/>
            war to the Athenians, who bad previously tried it with little <lb/>
            success, he showed that nothing had been done in it with <lb/>
            prudent management, so their neglect might be made amends <lb/>
            for, whereas if no error had been committed, there would have <lb/>
            been no ground for better hopes for the future. 8. The same <lb/>
            orator, too, when he feared to give offence if he reproached the <lb/>
            people for their indolence in maintaining the liberty of their <lb/>
            country, preferred to dwell on the praise of their ancestors, who <lb/>
            had governed it, with such effect; for he thus found them <lb/>
            willing to listen, and it naturally followed that, while they <lb/>
            approved of the better, they repented of the worse. 9. As to <lb/>
            Cicero, his speech for Cluentius alone is worth an infinity of <lb/>
            examples. For what proof of sagacity in it hall I admire <lb/>
            most ? The opening of the case, in which he deprives the <lb/>
            mother, whose influence bore hard upon her son, of all credit? <note type="footnote"> * When Cicero saw that it was in contemplation to prolong the pro­ <lb/>
            eedings to another year and another prætorship, and to rescue the <lb/>
            accused by the aid of Hortensius and Metellus, who would then be <lb/>
            consuls, he contrived to avoid protracting his pleading, and spending <lb/>
            time on increasing the number of his charges, and called witnesses to <lb/>
            support each individual charge that he had made, consigning them to <lb/>
            Hortensius for examination; a mode by which Hortensius was so <lb/>
            fatigued, that he ceased to offer further opposition; and Verres, <lb/>
            despairing of support, want of his own accord into exile. Asconius <lb/>
            Pedianus. </note> <pb n="404"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            Or his determination to transfer the guilt of having bribed the <lb/>
            judges on the adverse party, rather than deny it, on account, as <lb/>
            he says, of the notorious infamy of their judgment ? Or his <lb/>
            recourse, last of all, in so odious an affair, to the support of the <lb/>
            law, a mode of defence by which he would have alienated the <lb/>
            feelings of the judges, if they had not been previously softened ? <lb/>
            Or his protestation that he adopted that course contrary to <lb/>
            the inclination of Cluentius? 10. Or what shall I commend <lb/>
            in his speech for Milo? That he made no statement <lb/>
            of the case until he had removed the prejudices entertained <lb/>
            against the accused ?* That he threw the odium of having <lb/>
            lain in wait upon Clodius, though the encounter was in <lb/>
            reality fortuitous ? That he commended the deed, and yet <lb/>
            exculpates Milo from having intentionally committed it? <lb/>
            That he put no supplications into the mouth of his client, but <lb/>
            took the character of suppliant on himself ?† It would be <lb/>
            endless to enumerate all the proofs of sagacity that he exhibits; <lb/>
            how he divests Cotta of all credit; ‡ how he opposes himself in <lb/>
            the place of Ligarius ;§ how he rescues Cornelius || by alleging <lb/>
            the openness of his confession. 11. I think it sufficient tc <lb/>
            observe, that there is nothing, not only in oratory, but in the <lb/>
            whole conduct of life, more valuable than sagacity; ¶ that <lb/>
            without it all instruction is given in vain ; and that judgment <lb/>
            can do more without learning than learning without judgment; <lb/>
            for it is the part of that virtue to adapt our speech to places, <lb/>
            circumstances, and characters. But as this part of my subject <lb/>
            is somewhat comprehensive, and is intimately connected with <lb/>
            oratorical effect, it shall be noticed when I proceed to give <lb/>
            directions on speaking with propriety... <note type="footnote"> * Comp. iii. 6, 98. </note><note type="footnote"> t Comp. c. 1, sect. 25, 27. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Comp. v. 13, SO. </note><note type="footnote"> § Comp. v. 10, 93. </note><note type="footnote"> || Comp. v. 13, 18, 26. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ See c. 8, sect. 34. </note><note type="footnote"> ** B. xL c. 1; camp. i. 5, 1. </note> </p>
