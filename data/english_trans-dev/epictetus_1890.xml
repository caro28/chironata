            <title type="main">EPICTETUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>VERY little is known of the life of Epictetus. It is said <lb/>
            that he was a native of Hierapolis in Phrygia, a town <lb/>
            between the Maeander and a branch of the Maeander <lb/>
            named the Lycus. Hierapolis is mentioned in the epistle <lb/>
            of Paul to the people of Colossae (Coloss. iv. 13); from <lb/>
            which it has been concluded that there was a Christian <lb/>
            church in Hierapolis in the time of the apostle. The date <lb/>
            of the birth of Epictetus is unknown. The only recorded <lb/>
            fact of his early life is that he was a slave in Reme, and <lb/>
            his master was Epaphroditus, a profligate freedman of the <lb/>
            emperor Nero. There is a story that the master broke his <lb/>
            slave's leg by torturing him ; but it is better to trust to <lb/>
            the evidence of Simplicius, the commentator on the Enchei­ <lb/>
            ridion or Manual, who says that Epictetus was weak in <lb/>
            body and lame from an early age. It is not said how he <lb/>
            became a slave; but it has been asserted in modern times <lb/>
            that the parents sold the child. I have not, however, <lb/>
            found any authority for this statement.</p>
          <p>It may be supposed that the young slave showed, intel­ <lb/>
            ligence, for his master sent or permitted him to attend the <lb/>
            lectures of C. Musonius Rufus, an eminent Stoic philoso­ <lb/>
            pher. It may seem strange that such a master should have <lb/>
            wished to have his slave made into a philosopher, but <lb/>
            Gamier, the author of a Mémoire sur les ouvrages <lb/>
            d'Epictète, explains this matter very well in a communica­ <lb/>
            tion to Schweighaeuser. Garnier says: "Epictetus, born <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            at Hierapolis of Phrygia of poor parents, was indebted <lb/>
            apparently for the advantages of a good education to the <lb/>
            whim, which was common at the end of the Republic and <lb/>
            under the first emperors, among the great of Rome to <lb/>
            reckon among their numerous slaves Grammarians, Poets, <lb/>
            Rhetoricians, and Philosophers, in the same way as rich <lb/>
            financiers in these later ages have been led to form at a <lb/>
            great cost rich and numerous libraries. This supposition <lb/>
            is the only one which can explain to us, how a wretched <lb/>
            child, born as poor as Irus, had received a good education, <lb/>
            and how a rigid Stoic was the slave of Epaphroditus, one <lb/>
            of the officers of the Imperial guard. For we cannot sus­ <lb/>
            pect that it was through predilection for the Stoic doctrine <lb/>
            and for his own use, that the confidant and the minister of <lb/>
            the debaucheries of Nero would have desired to possess <lb/>
            such a slave."</p>
          <p>Some writers assume that Epictetus was manumitted by <lb/>
            his master; but I can find no evidence for this statement. <lb/>
            Epaphroditus accompanied Nero when he fled from Rome <lb/>
            before his enemies, and he aided the miserable tyrant in <lb/>
            killing himself. Domitian (Sueton. Domit. 14) afterwards <lb/>
            put Epaphroditus to death for this service to Nero. We <lb/>
            may conclude that Epictetus in some way obtained his <lb/>
            freedom, and that he began to teach at Rome; but after <lb/>
            the expulsion of the philosophers from Rome by Domitian <lb/>
            A.D. 89, he retired to Nicopolis in Epirus, a city built by <lb/>
            Augustus to commemorate the victory at Actium. Epic­ <lb/>
            tetus opened a school or lecture room at Nicopolis, where <lb/>
            he taught till he was an old man. The time of his death <lb/>
            is unknown. Epictetus was never married, as we learn <lb/>
            from Lucian (Demonax, c. 55, Tom. ii. ed. Hemsterh. <lb/>
            p. 393).1 When Epictetus was finding fault with Demonax <lb/>
            and advising him to take a wife and beget children, for <lb/>
            this also, as Epictetus said, was a philosopher's duty, to <note type="footnote">1 Lucian's ' Life of the Philosopher Demonax.' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            leave in place of himself another in the Universe, Demonax <lb/>
            refuted the doctrine by answering, Give me then, Epic­ <lb/>
            tetus, one of your own daughters. Simplicius says (Com­ <lb/>
            ment. c. 46, p. 432, ed. Schweigh.) that Epictetus lived <lb/>
            alone a long time. At last he took a woman into his house <lb/>
            as a nurse'for a child, which one of Epictetus' friends was <lb/>
            going to expose on account of his poverty, but Epictetus <lb/>
            took the child and brought it up.</p>
          <p>Epictetus wrote nothing; and all that we have under <lb/>
            his name was written by an affectionate pupil, Arrian, <lb/>
            afterwards the historian of Alexander the Great, who, as <lb/>
            he tells us, took down in writing the philosophers dis­ <lb/>
            courses (the Epistle of Arrian to Lucius Gellius, p. 1). These <lb/>
            discourses formed eight books, but only four are extant <lb/>
            under the title of '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επικτήτου διατριβαί</foreign>. Simplicius in his <lb/>
            commentary on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ρίδιονο</foreign>r Manual, states that this <lb/>
            work also was put together by Arrian, who selected from <lb/>
            the discourses of Epictetus what he considered to be most <lb/>
            useful, and most necessary, and most adapted to move <lb/>
            men's minds. Simplicius also says that the contents of <lb/>
            the Encheiridion are found nearly altogether and in the <lb/>
            same words in various parts of the Discourses. Arrian <lb/>
            also wrote a work on the life and death of Epictetus. <lb/>
            The events of the philosopher's studious life were probably <lb/>
            not many nor remarkable; but we should have been glad <lb/>
            if this work had been preserved, which told, as Simplicius <lb/>
            says, what kind of man Epictetus was.</p>
          <p>Photius (Biblioth. 58) mentions among Arrian's works <lb/>
            Conversations with Epictetus, '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ομιλίαι 'Επικτήου</foreign> in twelve <lb/>
            books. Upton thinks that this work is only another name <lb/>
            for the Discourses, and that Photius has made the mistake <lb/>
            of taking the Conversations to be a different work from <lb/>
            the Discourses. Yet Photius has enumerated eight books <lb/>
            of the Discourses and twelve books of the Conversations. <lb/>
            Schweighaeuser observes that Photius had not seen these <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            works of Arrian on Epictetus, for so he concludes from the <lb/>
            brief notice of these works by Photius. The fact is that <lb/>
            Photius does not say that he had read these books, as he <lb/>
            generally does when he is speaking of the books, which <lb/>
            he enumerates in his Bibliotheca. The conclusion is that <lb/>
            we are not certain that there was a work of Arrian, <lb/>
            entitled the Conversations of Epictetus.</p>
          <p>The Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion and <lb/>
            Fragments were translated into English by the learned <lb/>
            lady Mrs. Elizabeth Carter; who is said to have lived to <lb/>
            the age of eighty-nine. The fourth edition (1807) contains <lb/>
            the translator's last additions and alterations. There is an <lb/>
            Introduction to this translation which contains a summary <lb/>
            view of the Stoic philosophy for the purpose of explaining <lb/>
            Epictetus; and also there are notes to the translation. The <lb/>
            editor of this fourth edition says that the Introduction <lb/>
            and notes of the Christian translator of Epictetus are, in <lb/>
            the estimation of most readers, not the least valuable parts <lb/>
            of the work" : and he adds " this was also the opinion of <lb/>
            the late Archbishop Secker, who though he thought very <lb/>
            highly of the philosophy of Epictetus, considered the <lb/>
            Introduction and notes as admirably calculated to prevent <lb/>
            any mistake concerning it, as well as to amend and instruct <lb/>
            the world." The Introduction is certainly useful, though <lb/>
            it is not free from errors. I do not think that the notes <lb/>
            are valuable. I have used some of them without any <lb/>
            remarks; and I have used others and made some remarks <lb/>
            on them where I thought that Mrs. Carter was mistaken <lb/>
            in her opinion of the original text, or on other matters.</p>
          <p>The translation of Mrs. Carter is good; and perhaps no <lb/>
            Englishman at that time would have made a bettor trans­ <lb/>
            lation. I intended at first to revise Mrs. Carter's transla­ <lb/>
            tion, and to correct any errors that I might discover. I <lb/>
            had revised about half of it, when I found that I was not <lb/>
            satisfied with my work; and I was advised by a learned <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            friend to translate the whole myself. This was rather a <lb/>
            great undertaking for an old man, who is now past seventy­ <lb/>
            six. I have however done the work with great care, and <lb/>
            as well as I could. I have always compared my transla­ <lb/>
            tion with the Latin version and with Mrs. Carter's; and I <lb/>
            think that.-this is the best way of avoiding errois such as <lb/>
            any translator may make. A man who has not attempted <lb/>
            to translate a Greek or Latin author does not know the <lb/>
            difficulty of the undertaking. That which may appear <lb/>
            plain when he reads, often becomes very difficult when he <lb/>
            tries to express it in another language. It is true that <lb/>
            Epictetus is generally intelligible; but the style or manner <lb/>
            of the author, or we may say of Arrian, who attempted to <lb/>
            produce what he heard, is sometimes made obscure by the <lb/>
            continual use of questions and answers to them, and for <lb/>
            other reasons.</p>
          <p>Upton remarks in a note on iii. 23 (p. 184 Trans.), that <lb/>
            " there are many passages in these dissertations which are <lb/>
            ambiguous or rather confused on account of the small <lb/>
            questions, and because the matter is not expanded by <lb/>
            oratorical copiousness, not to mention other causes." The <lb/>
            discourses of Epictetus, it is supposed, were spoken ex­ <lb/>
            tempore, and so one thing after another would come into <lb/>
            the thoughts of the speaker (Wolf). Schweighaeuser also <lb/>
            observes in a note (ii. 336 of his edition) that the con­ <lb/>
            nexion of the discourse is sometimes obscure through tho <lb/>
            omission of some words which are necessary to indicate the <lb/>
            connexion of the thoughts. The reader then will find that <lb/>
            he cannot always understand Epictetus, if he does not <lb/>
            read him very carefully, and some passages more than <lb/>
            once. He must also think and reflect, or he will miss the <lb/>
            meaning. I do not say that the book is worth all this <lb/>
            trouble. Every man must judge for himself. But I should <lb/>
            not have translated the book, if I had not thought it worth <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            study; and I think that all books of this kind require <lb/>
            careful reading, if they are worth reading at all.</p>
          <p>The text of Epictetus is sometimes corrupted, and this <lb/>
            corruption causes a few difficulties. However, these diffi­ <lb/>
            culties are not numerous enough to cause or to admit much <lb/>
            variety or diversity in the translations of the text. This <lb/>
            remark will explain why many parts of my translation are <lb/>
            the same or nearly the same as Mrs. Carter's. When this <lb/>
            happened, I did not think it necessary to alter my trans­ <lb/>
            lation in order that it might not be the same as hers. I <lb/>
            made my translation first, and then compared it with Mrs. <lb/>
            Carter's and the Latin version. I hope that I have not <lb/>
            made many blunders. I do not suppose that I have made <lb/>
            none.</p>
          <p>The last and best edition of the Discourses, the Enchei­ <lb/>
            ridion, and the fragments is by J. Schweighaeuser in 6 vols. <lb/>
            8vo. This edition contains the commentary of Simplicius <lb/>
            on the Encheiridion, and two volumes of useful notes on <lb/>
            the Discourses. These notes are selected from those of <lb/>
            Wolf, Upton, and a few from other commentators; but a <lb/>
            large part are by Schweighaeuser himself, who was an <lb/>
            excellent scholar and a very sensible man. I have read <lb/>
            all these notes, and I have used them. Many of the notes <lb/>
            to the translation are my own. <lb/>

            <title type="main">THE -PHILOSOPHY OF EPICTETUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I HAVE made a large Index to this book; and any person, <lb/>
            who has the necessary industry, may find in it almost <lb/>
            every passage in the Discourses in which the opinions of <lb/>
            the philosopher are stated; and thus he may acquire a <lb/>
            general notion of the philosophical system of Epictetus. <lb/>
            But few readers will have the time and the inclination for <lb/>
            this labour, and therefore I shall attempt to do the work <lb/>
            for them.</p>
          <p>I have found two expositions of the system of Epictetus. <lb/>
            One is by Dr. Heinrich Ritter in his Geschichte der Philo­ <lb/>
            sophie alter Zeit, Vierter Theil, 1839. The other is by <lb/>
            Professor Christian A. Brandish Both of these exposi­ <lb/>
            tions are useful; and I have used them. I do not think <lb/>
            that either of them is complete, nor will mine be. I shall <lb/>
            not make my exposition exactly in the same form as either <lb/>
            of them; nor shall I begin it in the same way.</p>
          <p>Ritter has prefixed a short sketch of C. Musonius Rufus, <lb/>
            a Roman Stoic, to his exposition of the system of Epic­ <lb/>
            tetus. Rufus taught at Rome under the emperor Nero, <lb/>
            who drove him from Rome; but Rufus returned after the <lb/>
            tyrant's death, and lived to the times of Vespasian and his <lb/>
            son Titus. He acquired great reputation as a teacher, but <lb/>
            there is no evidence that he wrote anything, and all that <lb/>
            we know of his doctrines is from a work of Pollio in <note type="footnote"> 1 Article EPIOTETUS in the 'Dictionary of Greek and Roman <lb/>

            Greek, which was written after the model of Xenophon'a <lb/>
            Memorabilia of Socrates. Of this work there are many <lb/>
            fragments.2</p>
          <p>Rufus taught a practical philosophy, one that was useful <lb/>
            for the purposes of life, and for the life of a philosopher <lb/>
            who was not hindered by following the common occupa­ <lb/>
            tions of mankind from philosophizing and aiding others to <lb/>
            philosophized He urged young men especially to the <lb/>
            study of philosophy, and even women, because without <lb/>
            philosophy no person can be virtuous and do his duty. He <lb/>
            asks, what hinders the scholar from working with his <lb/>
            teacher and at the same time learning from him something <lb/>
            about moderation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign>) and justice and endurance? <lb/>
            His belief in the power of philosophy over men's minds <lb/>
            was strong, and he was convinced that it was a perfect <lb/>
            cure for the corruption of mankind. He showed the firm­ <lb/>
            ness of this conviction on an occasion which is recorded <lb/>
            by Tacitus (Hist. iii. 81). He endeavoured to mediate <lb/>
            between the partizans of Vitellius who were in Rome, and <lb/>
            the army of Vespasian, which was before the gates: but <lb/>
            he failed in his attempt. His behaviour was like that of <lb/>
            a modern Christian, who should attempt to enforce the <lb/>
            Christian doctrines of peace on men who are arrayed <lb/>
            against one another with arms in their hands. Such a <lb/>
            Christian would be called a fanatic now; and Tacitus, <lb/>
            who was himself a philosopher, gives to the behaviour of <lb/>
            Rufus the mild term of "intempestivam" or "unseasonable." <lb/>
            The judgment of Tacitus was right: the behaviour of <note type="footnote"> 2 See the ' Fragments from Stobaeus,' cited by Ritter in his notes <lb/>
            (Vierter Theil, p. 204). The notice of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πωλίων</foreign> as he is named, in <lb/>

            Musonius by Polio or Pollio; and yet it states that Pollio taught at <lb/>

            Rufus was unseasonable, as the result proved; but the <lb/>
            attempt of Rufus was the act of a good man.</p>
          <p>Rufus did not value Dialectic or Logic so highly as the <lb/>
            old Stoics; but he did not undervalue it, and he taught <lb/>
            that a man should learn how to deal with sophistical argu­ <lb/>
            ments, as we learn from Epictetus (I. c. 7 at the end).</p>
          <p>In his teaching about the Gods he follows the general <lb/>
            Stoic practice of maintaining the popular religion. He <lb/>
            taught that nothing was unknown to the Gods: as Socrates <lb/>
            (Xenophon, Mem. i. c. 1) taught that the Gods knew every­ <lb/>
            thing, what was said, what was done, and what men <lb/>
            thought.. He considered the souls of men to be akin to <lb/>
            the Gods; but as they were mingled with the body, the <lb/>
            soul must partake of the impurities of the body. The <lb/>
            intelligent principle (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνοτα</foreign>) is free from all necessity <lb/>
            (compulsion) and self sufficient <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτεξούσιος</foreign>), We can only <lb/>
            conjecture that Rufus did not busy himself about either <lb/>
            Dialectic or Physic; for he said that philosophizing was. <lb/>
            nothing else than an inquiry about what is becoming and <lb/>
            conformable to duty; an inquiry which is conducted by <lb/>
            reason, and the result is exhibited in practice.</p>
          <p>The old Stoics considered virtue to be the property only <lb/>
            of the wise man; and they even doubted whether such a <lb/>
            man could be found. But Rufus said that it was not <lb/>
            impossible for such a man to exist, for we cannot conceive <lb/>
            such virtues as, a wise man possesses otherwise than from <lb/>
            the examples of human nature itself and by meeting with <lb/>
            men such as those who are named divine and godlike. <lb/>
            The Stoical doctrine that man should live according to <lb/>
            nature is not pressed so hard by Rufus as by some Stoics, <lb/>
            and he looks on a life which is conformable to nature as <lb/>
            not very difficult; but he admits that those who attempt <lb/>
            philosophy have been trained from youth in great corrup­ <lb/>
            tion and filled with wickedness, and so when they seek <lb/>
            after virtue they require more discipline or practice. Ac. <note type="footnote"> b 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            cordingly he views philosophy as a spiritual medicine, and <lb/>
            gives more weight to the practice or exercise of virtue <lb/>
            than the older Stoics did. The knowledge and the teach­ <lb/>
            ing of what is good, he says, should come first; but Rufus <lb/>
            did not believe that the knowledge of the Good was strong <lb/>
            enough without practice (discipline) to lead to moral con­ <lb/>
            duct, and consequently he believed that practice has greater <lb/>
            efficacy than teaching.4 He makes two kinds of exercise, <lb/>
            first, the exercise of the soul in thinking, in reflecting and <lb/>
            in stamping on the mind sound rules of life; and second, <lb/>
            in the enduring of bodily labours or pains, in which act <lb/>
            of endurance the soul and the body act together.</p>
          <p>" The sum of his several rules of life," says Hitter, may <lb/>
            be thus briefly expressed: in his opinion a life according <lb/>
            to Nature results in a social, philanthropic and contented <lb/>
            state of mind, joined to the most simple satisfaction of our <lb/>
            necessary wants. We see his social and philanthropic dis­ <lb/>
            position in this that he opposes all selfishness (selbstsucht), <note type="footnote"> 4 I have followed the exposition of Bitter here. Perhaps a literal <lb/>
            translation of the Greek is still better; " Reason which teaches how <lb/>
            we should act co-operates with practice, and reason (or teaching) <lb/>
            comes in order before custom (habit) or practice: for it is not possible <lb/>
            to become habituated to any thing good if a person is not habituated <lb/>
            by reason (by teaching); in power indeed the habit (practice) has the <lb/>
            advantage over teaching, for habit (practice) is more efficacious in <lb/>
            leading a man to act (properly) than reason is." I have given the <lb/>
            meaning of the Greek as accurately as I can. In our modern education <lb/>
            We begin with teaching general rules, or principles or beliefs; and there <lb/>
            we stop. The result is what might be expected. Practice or the habit <lb/>
            of doing what we ought to do is neglected. The teachers are teachers <lb/>
            of words and no more. They are the men whom Epictetus (iii. 21, <lb/>
            note 6) describes: " You have committed to memory the words only, and <lb/>
            you say, Sacred are the words by themselves." See p. 245, note 3. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> It is one of the greatest merits of Rufus that he laid down the <lb/>
            principle which is expounded above; and it is the greatest demerit of <lb/>
            our system of teaching that the principle is generally neglected: and <lb/>
            most particularly by those teachers who proclaim ostentatiously that <lb/>
            they give a religious education. </note> <lb/>

            that he views marriage not only as the sole right and <lb/>
            natural satisfaction of the sexual feelings, but also as the <lb/>
            foundation of family, of a state, and of the continuation <lb/>
            of the human race; and accordingly he declares himself <lb/>
            against the exposure of children as an unnatural practice; <lb/>
            and he often recommends beneficence."</p>
          <p>Epictetus was a pupil of this noble Roman teacher, whose <lb/>
            name occurs several times in the Discourses. Hitter con­ <lb/>
            jectures that Epictetus also heard Euphrates, whom he <lb/>
            highly commends. It has been justly said that, though <lb/>
            Epictetus is named a Stoic, and that his principles are <lb/>
            Stoical, he is not purely a Stoic. He learned from other <lb/>
            teachers as well as the Stoic. He quotes the teaching and <lb/>
            example of Socrates continually, and the example of Dio­ <lb/>
            genes the Cynic, both of whom he mentions more <lb/>
            frequently than Zeno the founder of the Stoic philosophy. <lb/>
            He also valued Plato, who accepted from Socrates many <lb/>
            of his principles, and developed and expanded them. So <lb/>
            Epictetus learned that the beginning of philosophy is <lb/>
            man's knowledge of himself (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γνῶθι σεαυτόν</foreign>), and the ac­ <lb/>
            knowledgment of his own ignorance and weakness. He <lb/>
            teaches (i. c. 17; ii. o. 14; ii. c. 10) that the examination <lb/>
            of names, the understanding of the notion, of the concep­ <lb/>
            tion of a thing, is the beginning of education: he con­ <lb/>
            sistently teaches that we ought to pity those who do <lb/>
            wrong, for they err in ignorance (i. c. 18; ii. c. 22, p. 181); <lb/>
            and, as Plato says, every mind is deprived of truth <lb/>
            unwillingly. Epictetus strongly opposes the doctrines of <lb/>
            Epicurus, of the newer Academics, and of Pyrrho, the <lb/>
            great leader of the Sceptical school (i. o. 5, o. 23; ii. o. 20). <lb/>
            He has no taste for the subtle discussions of these men. <lb/>
            He says (p. 81), "Let the followers of Pyrrho and the <lb/>
            Academics come and make their objections. For I, as to <lb/>
            my part, have no leisure for these disputes, nor am I able <lb/>
            to undertake the defence of common consent (opinion)." <lb/>
             <pb n="xxii"/>
            " How indeed perception is effected, whether through the <lb/>
            whole body or any part, perhaps I cannot explain; for <lb/>
            both opinions perplex me. But that you and I are not <lb/>
            the same, I know with perfect certainty. How do you <lb/>
            know it ? When I intend to swallow anything, I never <lb/>
            carry it to your mouth, but to my own. And yon your­ <lb/>
            selves (the Pyrrhonists), who take away the, evidence of <lb/>
            the senses, do you act otherwise ? Who among you, when <lb/>
            he intended to enter a bath, ever went into a mill ? " He <lb/>
            also says (ii. c. 20) that " the propositions which are true <lb/>
            and evident are of necessity used even by those who con­ <lb/>
            tradict them; and a man might perhaps consider it to be <lb/>
            the greatest proof of a thing being evident that it is <lb/>
            found to be necessary even for him who denies it to make <lb/>
            use of it at the same time. For instance, if a man should <lb/>
            deny that anything is universally true, it is plain that he <lb/>
            must make the contradictory negation, that nothing is <lb/>
            universally true."</p>
          <p>Epictetus did not undervalue Dialectic or Logic, and the <lb/>
            solution of what are called Sophistical and Hypothetical <lb/>
            arguments (i. c. 7); but he considered the handling of all <lb/>
            such arguments as a thing relating to the duties of life, <lb/>
            and as a means towards Ethic, or the practice of morals. <lb/>
            Rufus said, " for a man to use the appearances presented <lb/>
            to him rashly and foolishly and carelessly, and not to <lb/>
            understand argument nor demonstration nor sophism, nor, <lb/>
            in a word, to see in questioning and answering what is <lb/>
            consistent with that which we have granted or is not con­ <lb/>
            sistent : is there no error in this " ? Accordingly Dialectic <lb/>
            is not the object of our life, but it is a means for dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishing between true and false appearances, and for <lb/>
            ascertaining the validity of evidence, and it gives us <lb/>
            security in our judgments. It is the application of these <lb/>
            things to the purposes of life which is the first and neces­ <lb/>
            sary part of philosophy. So he says in the <unclear>Encheiriolion</unclear> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiii"/>
            (LI.): "The first and most necessary place in philosophy <lb/>
            is the use of theorems (precepts), for instance, That we <lb/>
            must not lie: the second is that of demonstration, for <lb/>
            instance, How is it proved that we ought not to lie: the <lb/>
            third is that which is confirmatory of these two and ex­ <lb/>
            planatory, for example, How is this a demonstration"? <lb/>
            The philosophy of Epictetus is in fact only the way of <lb/>
            living as a man ought to live, according to his nature.</p>
          <p>Epictetus accordingly views that part of the Stoic teach­ <lb/>
            ing, named Physic or the Nature of things, also as sub­ <lb/>
            ordinate to his philosophy, which is purely Ethical. We <lb/>
            ought to live according to Nature, and therefore we must <lb/>
            inquire what the Law of Nature is. The contemplation <lb/>
            of the order of things is the duty of man, and to observe <lb/>
            this wonderful system of which man is a part; but the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of the contemplation and the observation is that we <lb/>
            may live a life such as we ought to live. He says (Frag. <lb/>
            CLXXV., " What do I care whether all things are com­ <lb/>
            posed of atoms or of similar parts, or of fire and earth ? for is <lb/>
            it not enough to know the nature of the good and the evil, <lb/>
            and the measures of the desires and aversions, and also the <lb/>
            movements towards things and from them; and using these <lb/>
            as rules to administer the affairs of life, but not to trouble <lb/>
            ourselves about the things above us ? For these things are <lb/>
            perhaps incomprehensible to the human mind: and if any <lb/>
            man should even suppose them to be in the highest degree <lb/>
            comprehensible, what then is the profit of them, if they are <lb/>
            comprehended? And must we not say that those men <lb/>
            have needless trouble who assign these things as necessary <lb/>
            to a philosopher's discourse?" Epictetus then did not <lb/>
            value the inquiries of the Physical philosophers, or he had <lb/>
            no taste for them. His Philosophy was Ethical, and his <lb/>
            inquiry was, What is the rule of life ?</p>
          <p>" With respect to gods," says Epictetus (i. o. 12), " there <lb/>
            are some who say that a divine being does not exist: others <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiv"/>
            say that it exists, but is inactive and careless, and takes no <lb/>
            forethought about anything; a third class say such a being <lb/>
            exists and exercises forethought, but only about great <lb/>
            things and heavenly things, and about nothing on the <lb/>
            earth; a fourth class say that a divine being exercises <lb/>
            forethought both about things on the earth and- heavenly <lb/>
            things, but in a general way only, and not about things <lb/>
            severally. There is a fifth class to whom Ulysses and <lb/>
            Socrates belong, who say, 'I move not without thy know­ <lb/>
            ledge,'" (Iliad, x. 278). After a few remarks Epictetus <lb/>
            concludes: " The wise and good man then after consider, <lb/>
            ing all these things, submits his own mind to him <unclear>wh</unclear> <lb/>
            administers the whole, as good citizens do to the law or <lb/>
            the state."</p>
          <p>The foundation of the Ethic of Epictetus is the doctrine <lb/>
            which the Stoic Cleanthes proclaimed in his hymn to Zeus <lb/>
            (God), " From thee our race comes." Epictetus speaks of <lb/>
            Gods, whom we must venerate and make offerings to ; <lb/>
            and of God, from whom we all are sprung in an especial <lb/>
            manner. " God is the father both of men and of Gods." <lb/>
            This great descent ought to teach us to have no ignoble or <lb/>
            mean thoughts about ourselves. He says, " Since these, <lb/>
            two things are mingled in the generation of man, body <lb/>
            in common with the animals, and reason and intel­ <lb/>
            ligence in common with the Gods, many incline to this <lb/>
            kinship, which is miserable and mortal; and some few to <lb/>
            that which is divine and happy" (i. c. 3). In a chapter of <lb/>
            Providence (i. c. 6) he attempts to prove the existence of <lb/>
            God and his government of the world by everything which <lb/>
            is or happens; but in order to understand these proofs, a, <lb/>
            man, he says, must have the faculty of seeing what belongs <lb/>
            and happens to " all persons and things, and a grateful <lb/>
            disposition " (also, i. c. 16). He argues from the very struc­ <lb/>
            ture of things which have attained their completion, that <lb/>
            we are accustomed to show that a work is certainly the act <lb/>
             <pb n="xxv"/>
            of some artificer, and that it has not been constructed <lb/>
            without a purpose. " Does then each of these things de­ <lb/>
            monstrate the workman, and do not visible things and the <lb/>
            faculty of seeing and light demonstrate him " ? He then <lb/>
            considers the constitution of man's understanding and its <lb/>
            operations; and he asks, if this is not sufficient to convince <lb/>
            us, let people " explain to us what it is that makes each <lb/>
            several thing, or how it is possible that things so wonderful <lb/>
            and like the contrivances of art should exist by chance­ <lb/>
            and from their own proper motion " ?</p>
          <p>It is enough for animals to do what their nature leads <lb/>
            them to do without understanding why they do it. But it. <lb/>
            is not enough for us to whom God has given also the intel­ <lb/>
            lectual faculty; for unless we act conformably to the nature <lb/>
            and constitution of each thing, we shall never attain our <lb/>
            true end. God has introduced man into the world to be a. <lb/>
            spectator of God and his works; and not only a spectator <lb/>
            of them, but an interpreter. For this reason, he says, " it <lb/>
            is shameful for man to begin and to end where irrational <lb/>
            animals do; but rather he ought to begin where they begin, <lb/>
            and to end where nature ends in us; and nature ends in <lb/>
            contemplation and understanding, and in a way of life con­ <lb/>
            formable to nature" (p. 21). He examines in another <lb/>
            chapter (i. c. 9), How from the fact that we are akin to <lb/>
            God, a man may proceed to the consequences. Here he <lb/>
            shows that a man who has observed with intelligence the <lb/>
            administration of the world, and has learned that the­ <lb/>
            greatest community is that which is composed of men and <lb/>
            God, and that from God came all beings which are pro­ <lb/>
            duced on the earth, and particularly rational beings who <lb/>
            are by reason conjoined with him,—" why should not such <lb/>
            a man call himself a citizen of the world, why not a son. <lb/>
            of God, and why should he be afraid of anything which <lb/>
            happens among men ?-when you have God for your maker, <lb/>
            and father, and guardian, shall not this release us from <lb/>
            sorrows and fears?"</p><pb n="xxvi"/>
            
          <p>In this chapter also is a supposed address of Epictetus <lb/>
            to those people who on account of the bonds of the body <lb/>
            and the troubles of this life intend to throw them off, " and <lb/>
            to depart to their kinsmen." Epictetus says, "Friends, <lb/>
            wait for God: when He shall give the signal and release <lb/>
            you from this service, then go to Him; but for the present <lb/>
            endure to dwell in this place where He has put you—wait <lb/>
            then, do not depart without a reason." He gives the ex­ <lb/>
            ample of Socrates, who said that if God has put us in any <lb/>
            place, we ought not to desert it. I think that Epictetus <lb/>
            did not recommend suicide in any case, though he admitted <lb/>
            that there were cases in which he would not condemn it; <lb/>
            but a man ought to have good reasons for leaving his <lb/>
            post.</p>
          <p>The teaching of Epictetus, briefly expressed, is, that man <lb/>
            ought to be thankful to God for all things, and always <lb/>
            content with that which happens, for what God chooses is <lb/>
            better than what man can choose (iv. c. 7). This is what <lb/>
            Bishop Butler says, " Our resignation to the will of God <lb/>
            may be said to be perfect when our will is lost and resolved <lb/>
            up into his; when we rest in his will as our end, as being <lb/>
            itself most just and right and good." (Sermon on the Love <lb/>
            of God.)</p>
          <p>. I have not discovered any passage in which Epictetus <lb/>
            gives any opinion of the mode of God's existence. He dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishes God the maker and governor of the universe <lb/>
            from the universe itself. His belief in the existence of <lb/>
            this great power is as strong as any Christian's could be; <lb/>
            and very much stronger than the belief of many who call <lb/>
            themselves Christians, and who solemnly and publicly <lb/>
            declare " I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of <lb/>
            heaven and earth." Epictetus teaches us what our duty is <lb/>
            towards God; and there is no doubt that he practised <lb/>
            what he taught, as a sincere and honest man should do, or <lb/>
            at least try to do with all his might. We must suppose <lb/>
            that a man of his temper of mind, and his great abilities <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvii"/>
            did what he recommends (Fragments, cxviii., cxix.): " Let <lb/>
            your talk of God be renewed every day rather than your <lb/>
            food"; and " Think of God more frequently than you <lb/>
            breathe." I see no other conclusion that such a man could <lb/>
            come to than this, that God exists without doubt, and that <lb/>
            He is incomprehensible to such feeble creatures as man <lb/>
            who lives in so feeble a body. See p. 21, note 5.</p>
          <p>We must now see what means God has given to His <lb/>
            children for doing their duty. Epictetus begins by show­ <lb/>
            ing what things God has put in our power, and what <lb/>
            things he has not (i. c. 1; Encheir. 1). " That which is <lb/>
            best of all and supreme over all is the only thing which <lb/>
            the gods have placed in our power, the right use of appear­ <lb/>
            ances; but all other things they have not placed in our <lb/>
            power "; and the reason of this limitation of man's power <lb/>
            is, " that as we exist on the earth and are bound to such <lb/>
            a body and to such companions, how was it possible for us <lb/>
            not to be hindered as to these things by externals ?" He <lb/>
            says again (Encheirid. 1): " Of things some are in our <lb/>
            power, and others are not. In our power are opinion, <lb/>
            movement towards a thing, desire, aversion (turning from <lb/>
            a thing); and in a word, whatever are our own acts: not <lb/>
            in our power are the body, property, reputation, offices <lb/>
            (magisterial power), and in a word, whatever are not our <lb/>
            own acts. And the things in our power are by nature free, <lb/>
            not subject to restraint nor hindrance: but the things not <lb/>
            in our power are weak, slavish, subject to restraint, in the <lb/>
            power of others." This is his notion of man's freedom. <lb/>
            On this notion all his system rests. He says (i. c. 17): <lb/>
            " if God had made that part of himself, which he took <lb/>
            from himself and gave to us, of such a nature as to be <lb/>
            hindered or compelled either by himself or by another he <lb/>
            would not then be God nor would he be taking care of us <lb/>
            as he ought." ,</p>
          <p>He says (i. o. 1; iii. o. 3; and elsewhere) that the right <lb/>
             <pb n="xxviii"/>
            use of appearances is the only thing that the gods have <lb/>
            placed in our power; and " that it is the business of the <lb/>
            wise and good man to use appearances conformably to <lb/>
            nature." For this purpose a man has what Epictetus names <lb/>
            a ruling faculty (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τό ἡγεμονικόν</foreign>), of which he gives a defini­ <lb/>
            tion or description (iv. c. 7). It is that faculty " which uses <lb/>
            all other faculties and tries them, and selects and rejects;" <lb/>
            a faculty by which we reflect and judge and determine, <lb/>
            a faculty which no other animal has, a faculty which, <lb/>
            as Bishop Butler says, "plainly bears upon it marks of <lb/>
            authority over all the rest, and claims the absolute direc­ <lb/>
            tion of them all, to allow or forbid their gratification " <lb/>
            (Prefaoe to the Sermons).</p>
          <p>These appearances are named <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασίαι</foreign> by Epictetus; <lb/>
            and the word is translated " Visa animi " by Gellius (Frag, <lb/>
            clxxx.). This Phantasy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>) is not only the thing <lb/>
            which is perceived by the eyes, but the impression which <lb/>
            is made on the eyes, and generally it means any impression <lb/>
            received by the senses; and also it is the power of the <lb/>
            mind to represent things as if they were present, though <lb/>
            they are only present in the mind and are really absent. <lb/>
            This power of Phantasy exists also in animals in various <lb/>
            degrees according to their several capacities : animals make <lb/>
            use of appearances, but man only understands the use of <lb/>
            appearances (i. o. 6).5 If a man cannot or does not make <lb/>
            a right use of appearances, he approaches the nature of an <lb/>
            irrational animal; and he is not what God made him <lb/>
            capable of being.</p>
          <p>The nature of the Good is in the use of appearances, <note type="footnote"> 5 I suppose that this will be generally allowed to be true. Whatever <lb/>
            an animal can do, we shall hardly admit that he understands the use <lb/>
            of appearances, and uses them as a man can. However the powers <lb/>
            of some animals, such as ants for example, are very wonderful; and <lb/>
            it may be contended that they are not irrational in many of their acts <lb/>
            but quite rational. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxix"/>
            and the nature of evil likewise; and things independent <lb/>
            of the will do not admit either the nature of evil or of <lb/>
            good (ii. c. 1). The good and the bad are in man's will, <lb/>
            and in nothing external. The rational power therefore <lb/>
            leads us to acknowledge as good only that which is con­ <lb/>
            formable to reason, and to recognize as bad that which is <lb/>
            not conformable to reason. The matter on which the good <lb/>
            man labours is his rational faculty (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἴδιον ἡγεμονικόν</foreign>): <lb/>
            that is the business of the philosopher (iii. c. 3). A man <lb/>
            who wishes to be what he is by nature, by his constitution, <lb/>
            adapted for becoming, must struggle against appear­ <lb/>
            ances" (ii. c. 18). This is not an easy thing, but it is the <lb/>
            only way of obtaining true freedom, tranquillity of mind, <lb/>
            and the dominion over the movements of the soul, in a <lb/>
            word happiness, which is the true end and purpose of man's <lb/>
            existence on earth. Every man carries in him his own <lb/>
            enemy, whom he must carefully watch (Ench. xlviii.). <lb/>
            There is danger that appearances, which powerfully resist <lb/>
            reason, will carry you away: if you are conquered twice <lb/>
            or even once, there is danger that a habit of yielding to <lb/>
            them will be formed. "Generally, then, if you would <lb/>
            make anything a habit, do it: if you would not make it a <lb/>
            habit, do not do it; but accustom yourself to do something <lb/>
            else in place of it" (ii. c. 18). As to pleasure Epictetus <lb/>
            says (Ench. xxxiv.): " If you have received the impression <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασίαν</foreign>) of any pleasure, guard yourself against being <lb/>
            carried away by it; but let the thing wait for you, and <lb/>
            allow yourself a certain delay on your own part. Then <lb/>
            think of both times, of the time when you will enjoy the <lb/>
            pleasure, and of the time after the enjoyment of the plea­ <lb/>
            sure when you will repent and reproach yourself. And <lb/>
            set against these things how you will rejoice, if you have <lb/>
            abstained from the pleasure, and how you will commend <lb/>
            yourself. But if it seem to you seasonable to undertake <lb/>
            (do) the tiling, take care that the charm of it, and the <lb/>
             <pb n="xxx"/>
            pleasure, and the attraction of it shall not conquer you. <lb/>
            and set on the other side the consideration how much <lb/>
            better it is to be conscious that you have gained this <lb/>
            victory."</p>
          <p>Hence the rule that a man must be careful and cautious <lb/>
            in everything which is in the power of the will; but on <lb/>
            the contrary, with respect to externals which are not in a <lb/>
            man's power, he must be bold. " Confidence (courage) <lb/>
            then ought to be employed against death, and caution <lb/>
            against the fear of death: but now we do the contrary, <lb/>
            and employ against death the attempt to escape; and to <lb/>
            our opinion about it we employ carelessness, rashness and <lb/>
            indifference" (ii. c. 1). For the purification of the soul <lb/>
            and enabling it to employ its powers a man must root out <lb/>
            of himself two things, arrogance (pride, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴησις</foreign>)and dis­ <lb/>
            trust. " Arrogance is the opinion that you want nothing <lb/>
            (are deficient in nothing); but distrust is the opinion that <lb/>
            you cannot be happy when so many circumstances sur­ <lb/>
            round you." 6</p>
          <p>The notion of Good and Bad should be firmly fixed in <lb/>
            man's mind. There is in the opinion of Epictetus no <lb/>
            difference among men on this matter. He says (ii. c. 11) <lb/>
            on the beginning of Philosophy: As to good and evil, and <lb/>
            what we ought to do and what we ought not to do, and <lb/>
            the like, " whoever came into the world without having <lb/>
            an idea (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμφυτος ἔννοια</foreign>) of them ?" These general notions he <lb/>
            names <foreign xml:lang="grc">προλήψες</foreign>,preconceptions, or praecognitions (ii. c. 2) ; <lb/>
            and we need discipline " in order to learn how to adapt <lb/>
            the preconception of the rational and the irrational to the <lb/>
            several things conformably to nature." Why then do men <lb/>
            differ in their opinions about particular things? The <lb/>
            differences arise in the adaptation of the praecognitions to <lb/>
            the particular cases. He says (iv. c. 1): "This is the <note type="footnote"> 6 Bitter, p. 227, has a wrong reading in his quotation of this <lb/>
            passage, and he has misunderstood it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxi"/>
            cause to men of all their evils, the not being able to adapt <lb/>
            the general preconceptions to the several things." It is so <lb/>
            in everything. General principles are often very simple <lb/>
            and intelligible; but when we come to the application of the <lb/>
            principles, there arises difficulty and difference of opinions. <lb/>
            " Education is the learning how to adapt the natural prae­ <lb/>
            cognitions to the particular things conformably to nature; <lb/>
            and then to distinguish that of things some are in our <lb/>
            power, but others are not." The Great Law of Life <lb/>
            (i. c. 26) is that we must act conformably to nature. " In <lb/>
            theory there is nothing which draws us away from follow­ <lb/>
            ing what is taught; but in the matters of life, many are <lb/>
            the things which distract us." A man then must not <lb/>
            begin with the matters of real life, for it is not easy to <lb/>
            begin with the more difficult things. " This then is the <lb/>
            beginning of philosophy, a man's perception of the state of <lb/>
            his ruling faculty; for when a man knows that it is weak, <lb/>
            then he will not employ it on things of the greatest diffi­ <lb/>
            culty"; and again (ii. 11), the beginning of philosophy <lb/>
            is a man's consciousness about his own weakness and <lb/>
            inability about necessary things " : and further, " this is <lb/>
            the beginning of philosophy, a perception of the disagree­ <lb/>
            ment of men with one another, and an inquiry into the <lb/>
            cause of the disagreement, and a condemnation and distrust <lb/>
            of that which only ' seems,' and a certain investigation of <lb/>
            that which ' seems,' whether it' seems' rightly, and a dis­ <lb/>
            covery of some rule, as we have discovered a balance in the <lb/>
            determination of weights, and a carpenter's rule (or square) <lb/>
            in the case of straight and crooked things. This is the <lb/>
            beginning of philosophy."</p>
          <p>Epictetus urges the fact of a man assenting to or not <lb/>
            assenting to a thing as a proof that man possesses scno­ <lb/>
            thing which is naturally free. He says (p. 253): " Who is <lb/>
            able to compel you to assent to that which appears false ? <lb/>
            No man. And who can compel you not to assent to thai <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxii"/>
            which appears true ? No man. By this then you see that <lb/>
            there is something in you naturally free. But to desire 01 <lb/>
            to be averse from, or to move towards an object or to move <lb/>
            from it, or to prepare yourself, or to propose to do any­ <lb/>
            thing, which of you can do this, unless he has received an <lb/>
            impression of the appearance of that which is profitable <lb/>
            or a duty? No man. You have then in these things also <lb/>
            something which is not hindered and is free. Wretched <lb/>
            men, work out this, take care of this, seek for good here." <lb/>
            (Compare iv. c. 1 p. 303, and note 20.)</p>
          <p>Here the philosopher teaches that a man's opinion or his <lb/>
            belief cannot be compelled by another, though we may <lb/>
            conclude from what we see and hear and is done in the <lb/>
            world, that a large part of mankind do not know this fact. <lb/>
            A man cannot even think or believe as he chooses himself: <lb/>
            if a thing is capable of demonstration, and if he under­ <lb/>
            stands demonstration, he must believe what is demon­ <lb/>
            strated. If the thing is a matter of probable evidence, he <lb/>
            will follow that which seems the more probable, if he has <lb/>
            any capacity for thinking. I say' any capacity' for think­ <lb/>
            ing, because the intellectual power in the minds of a great <lb/>
            number of persons is very weak; and in all of us often <lb/>
            very weak compared with the power of the necessities of <lb/>
            our nature, of our desires, of our passions, in fact of all <lb/>
            that is in this wonderful creature man, which is not pure <lb/>
            reason or pure understanding or whatever name we give <lb/>
            to the powers named intellectual.</p>
          <p>The second part of this last quotation from Epictetua <lb/>
            relates to the Will, by which I mean, and I suppose that <lb/>
            he means, the wish and the intention and the attempt to <lb/>
            do something particular, or to abstain from doing some <lb/>
            particular thing. Much has been written about man's <lb/>
            Will. Some persons think that he has none; that he <lb/>
            moves as he is moved, and cannot help himself. Epictetus <unclear/> <lb/>
            asno essay or dissertation on this matter; and it would <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiii"/>
            have been contrary to his method of teaching to make a <lb/>
            formal discussion of the Will, after the manner of modern <lb/>
            philosophers. He does not touch on the question of man's <lb/>
            will as dependent on the will of God, or as acting in oppo­ <lb/>
            sition to it. God has made man as free as he could be in <lb/>
            such a body, in which he must live on the earth. This <lb/>
            body is not man's own, but it is clay finely tempered; and <lb/>
            God has also given to man a small portion of himself, in a <lb/>
            word, the faculty of using the appearances of things, of <lb/>
            which faculty Epictetus says, "if you will take care of <lb/>
            this faculty and consider it your only possession, you will <lb/>
            never be hindered, never meet with impediments, you will <lb/>
            not lament, you will not blame, you will not flatter any <lb/>
            person "(i. c. 1). He says (iv. c. 12) that God "has placed <lb/>
            me with myself, and has put my will in obedience to myself <lb/>
            alone, and has given me rules for the right use of it."</p>
          <p>The word of Epictetus which I have always translated <lb/>
            by Will is <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>,which is literally a ' preference,' a <lb/>
            choice of one thing before another, or before any other <lb/>
            thing; a description which is sufficiently intelligible.7 <note type="footnote"> 7 H. Stephanus in his Greek Lexicon (s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἱρέω</foreign>)has a long discus­ <lb/>
            sion on the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίεσις</foreign>: which is not satisfactory. Ho objects to. <lb/>
            the translation by the old scholars of <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign> by ' Electio,'' choice, <lb/>
            because <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>. he says, is not 'Electio,' but it is that which <lb/>
            follows from the choice itself. " For," he adds, " Electio is the act of <lb/>
            ' choosing, of selection,' and Electio can only be in the mind, when we <lb/>
            have chosen this or that." This distinction is trifling. When he says <lb/>
            that "<foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign> applies to him who out of several things selects one, <lb/>
            after deliberation and prefers it to others," he says right, and this is. <lb/>
            sufficient. He then discusses whether <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίεσις</foreign> should be rendered, <lb/>
            when Aristotle uses it strictly, by ' Propositum' or ' Consilium,' and <lb/>
            he decides in favour of' Propositum.' At the beginning of Aristotle's <lb/>
            Ethic he translates <foreign xml:lang="grc">πᾶσα προαίρεσις</foreign> by ' Propositum omne,' or ' Con­ <lb/>
            silium omne:' but he prefers ' Propositum.' He objects to the Latin <lb/>
            translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>by ' Voluntas' in cases where Aristotle uses <lb/>
            the word strictly, for Aristotle makes a distinction between <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">βούλησις</foreign>. A distinction between <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίεσις</foreign>and <foreign xml:lang="grc">βούλησις</foreign> is <lb/>
            certain, and it is plain. But Stephanus does not seem to know that </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiv"/>
            Though Epictetus contends that man has power over his <lb/>
            will, he well knew how weak this power sometimes is. <lb/>
            An appearance, he says (p. 86), is presented, and straight­ <lb/>
            way I act according to it; and, what is the name of those <lb/>
            who follow every appearance ? They are called madmen.- <lb/>
            Such are a large part of mankind; and it is true, that <lb/>
            many persons have no Will at all. They are deceived by <lb/>
            appearances, perplexed, tossed about like a ship which has <lb/>
            lost the helm: they have no steady, fixed, and rational <lb/>
            purpose. Their perseverance or obstinacy is often nothing <lb/>
            more than a perseverance in an irrational purpose. It is <lb/>
            often so strong and so steady that the man himself and <lb/>
            others too may view it as a strong will; and it is a strong <lb/>
            will, if you choose, but it is a will in a wrong direction. <lb/>
            "The nature of the Good is a certain Will: the nature of <lb/>
            the Bad is a certain kind of Will" (i. c. 29).</p>
          <p>Those who have been fortunate in their parents and in <lb/>
            their education, who have acquired good habits, and are <lb/>
            not greatly disturbed by the affects and the passions, may <note type="footnote"> the Latin word ' voluntas,' especially in the law writers, does <lb/>
            represent a deliberate purpose or will, as when a man intends, designs, <lb/>

            case the Romans rightly viewed the will as equivalent to the deed. <lb/>
            Cicero (Tuscul. iv. 6) says, " Quamobrem simul objecta species <lb/>

            but, he adds, it has a wider meaning than is generally given to the <lb/>
            Latin word, and it comprehends the intellect with the will, and all <lb/>

            pass through life calmly and with little danger, even when <lb/>
            the powers of the will are very weak, and hardly ever <lb/>
            exercised. Life with them is fortunately a series of habits, <lb/>
            generally good, or at least not bad. This is the condi­ <lb/>
            tion of many men and women. They are good or seem to <lb/>
            be good, because they are not tried above their power; but <lb/>
            if a temptation should suddenly surprise them when they <lb/>
            are not prepared for it, they are conquered and they fall. <lb/>
            Even a man, who has trained himself to the exercise of <lb/>
            his rational faculties and has for a long time passed a <lb/>
            blameless life, may in a moment when his vigilance is <lb/>
            relaxed, when he is off his guard, be defeated by the <lb/>
            enemy whom he always carries about with him.</p>
          <p>The difference between a man, who has within him the <lb/>
            principles of reason and him who has not, appears from a <lb/>
            story told by Gellius (xix. 1):—We were sailing, he says, <lb/>
            from Cassiopa to Brundisium when a violent storm came <lb/>
            on. In the ship there was a Stoic philosopher, a man of <lb/>
            good repute. He who told the story says that he kept his <lb/>
            eyes on the philosopher to see how he behaved under the <lb/>
            circumstances. The philosopher did not weep and bewail <lb/>
            like the rest, but his complexion and apparent perturbation <lb/>
            did not much differ from those of the other passengers. <lb/>
            When the danger was over, a wealthy Greek from Asia, <lb/>
            went up to the Stoic, and in an insulting manner said, <lb/>
            How is this, philosopher ? when we were in danger, you <lb/>
            were afraid and grew pale; but I was neither afraid nor <lb/>
            was I pale. The philosopher after a little hesitation said, <lb/>
            If I seemed to be a little afraid in so violent a tempest, <lb/>
            you are not worthy to hear the reason of it. However he <lb/>
            told the man a story about Aristippus8, who on a like occa­ <lb/>
            sion was questioned by a man like this Greek; and so the <lb/>
            philosopher got rid of the impertinent fellow. When they <note type="footnote"> 8 Or a follower of Aristippus. The text is not certain. </note> <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxvi"/>
            arrived at Brundisium, the narrator asked the philosopher <lb/>
            for an explanation of his fear, which the philosopher <lb/>
            readily gave. He took out of his bag a work of Epictetus, <lb/>
            the fifth book of his discourses in which was the following <lb/>
            passage (Frag. clxxx.): The affects of the mind (visa. <lb/>
            animi), which philosophers name <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασίαι</foreign>, by which a <lb/>
            man's mind is struck by the first appearance of a thing <lb/>
            which approaches, are not things which belong to the will <lb/>
            nor in our power, but by a peculiar force they intrude <lb/>
            themselves on men. But the assents, which they name <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">συγκαταθέσεις</foreign> (the assents of the judgment), by which the <lb/>
            same affects (visa animi) are known and determined are <lb/>
            from the will and are in the power of men to make. For this <lb/>
            reason when some frightful sound in the heavens or from <lb/>
            a fall, or some sudden news of danger comes, or any thing <lb/>
            of the same kind happens, it is unavoidable that even the <lb/>
            mind of the wise man must be moved somewhat and con­ <lb/>
            founded, and that he must grow pale, not through an <lb/>
            opinion which he has first conceived of any danger (or <lb/>
            evil), but by certain rapid and inconsiderate emotions <lb/>
            which anticipate (prevent) the exercise of the mind and the <lb/>
            reason. In a short time however the wise man does not <lb/>
            allow these emotions (visa animi) to remain, but he rejects <lb/>
            them, and he sees nothing terrible in them. But this is <lb/>
            the difference between the fool and the wise man: the <lb/>
            fool, as the things at the first impulse appeared to be <lb/>
            dangerous, such he thinks them to be; but the wise man, <lb/>
            when he has been moved for a short time, recovers the <lb/>
            former state and vigour of his mind, which he always had <lb/>
            with reference to such appearances, that they are not <lb/>
            objects of fear, but only terrify by a false show.9</p>
          <p>This explanation may be applied to all the events, to all <lb/>
            the thoughts and to all the emotions which disturb the mind <note type="footnote"> 9 This is the general sense of the passage. The translation is not <lb/>
            easy. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxvii"/>
            and the reason, whatever be their cause or nature. If a man's <lb/>
            mind has been long under proper discipline, after reflec­ <lb/>
            tion he is able to recover from this disorder and to resume <lb/>
            his former state. If he has not been under proper dis­ <lb/>
            cipline when his powers of reason are thus assailed, he <lb/>
            may do any thing however foolish or bad. A sound ex­ <lb/>
            ercise of the faculty of the Will therefore requires dis­ <lb/>
            cipline, in order that it may be corrected and maintained. <lb/>
            A man must exercise his will and improve it by labour so <lb/>
            as to make it conformable to nature and free. This exer­ <lb/>
            cise of the will and the improvement of it are a labour <lb/>
            that never ends. A man should begin it as soon as he <lb/>
            can. If the question is asked how a man must begin, who <lb/>
            has never been trained by a parent or teacher to observe <lb/>
            carefully his own conduct, to reflect, to determine, and <lb/>
            then to act, I cannot tell. Perhaps a mere accident, some <lb/>
            trifle which many persons would not notice, may be the <lb/>
            beginning of a total change in a man's life, as in the case <lb/>
            of Polemon, who was a dissolute youth, and as he was by <lb/>
            chance passing the lecture room of Xenocrates, he and his <lb/>
            drunken companions burst into the room. Polemon was <lb/>
            so affected by the words of the excellent teacher, that he <lb/>
            came out a different man, and at last succeeded Xenocrates <lb/>
            in the school of the Academy (iii. c. 1). Folly and bad <lb/>
            habits then may by reflection be altered into wisdom and <lb/>
            a good course of life. If such a thing hap pens, and un­ <lb/>
            doubtedly it has happened, it may be said that the origin <lb/>
            of the change is not in a man's will, but in something <lb/>
            external. Granted: a thing external has presented an <lb/>
            appearance to a man, but the effect of the appearance <lb/>
            would not be the same in all men, as we presume that it <lb/>
            was not the same, as the story is told, in Polemon and his <lb/>
            companions. One man in this case had a temper or dis­ <lb/>
            position and a capacity to use his mental power and to <lb/>
            profit by the words of Xenocrates. It may be said that <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxviii"/>
            this temper or disposition and capacity are not in the <lb/>
            power of a man's Will; and this is true. But that <lb/>
            matter is nothing to us. Men have various capacities, and, <lb/>
            as Epictetus would say, they are the gift of God, who dis­ <lb/>
            tributes them as he pleases. One man has the power of <lb/>
            using an appearance in a way which is good for himself, <lb/>
            and another has not. We can say no more. In whatever <lb/>
            way then a man has been led to exercise his will towards <lb/>
            a good end, he must practise the exercise of his will for <lb/>
            such an end; ho must make a habit of it, which habit will <lb/>
            acquire strength; and he may then have a reasonable hope <lb/>
            that he will not often fail in his good purpose. This I <lb/>
            believe to be the meaning of Epictetus, as we may collect <lb/>
            from the numerous passages in which he speaks of the will. <lb/>
            I hope that no reader will think that I propose what I <lb/>
            have said as a sufficient explanation of a difficult matter, <lb/>
            I have only said what I think to be sufficient to explain <lb/>
            Epictetus; and I have said what seems to me to be true.</p>
          <p>Epicurus taught that we should not marry nor beget <lb/>
            children nor engage in public affairs, because these things <lb/>
            disturb our tranquillity. Epictetus and the Stoics taught <lb/>
            that a man should marry, should beget children, and dis­ <lb/>
            charge all the duties of a citizen. In one of his best dis­ <lb/>
            courses (iii. o. 22; About Cynism), in which he describes <lb/>
            what kind of person a Cynic (his ideal philosopher) should <lb/>
            be, he says that he is a messenger from God (Zeus) to men <lb/>
            about good and bad things, to show them that they have <lb/>
            wandered and are seeking the substance of good and evil <lb/>
            where it is not; but where it is, they never think. The <lb/>
            Cynic is supposed to say, How is it possible that a man <lb/>
            like himself, who is houseless and has nothing can live <lb/>
            happily ? The answer is, See, God has sent you a man to <lb/>
            show you that it is possible. The man has no city, nor <lb/>
            house, he has nothing; he has no wife, nor children; and <lb/>
            yet he wants nothing. In reply to a question whether a <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxix"/>
            Cynic should marry and procreate children, Epictetus <lb/>
            answers: " If you grant me a community of wise men, <lb/>
            perhaps no man will readily apply himself to the Cynic <lb/>
            practice." However, he says, if he does, nothing will <lb/>
            prevent him from marrying and begetting children, for his <lb/>
            wife will be another like himself. "But," he adds, " in the <lb/>
            present state of things which is like that of an army <lb/>
            placed in battle order, is it not fit that the Cynic should <lb/>
            without any distraction be employed only on the ministra­ <lb/>
            tion of God, able to go about among men, not tied down <lb/>
            to the common duties of mankind, nor entangled in the <lb/>
            ordinary relations of life, which if he neglects, he will not <lb/>
            maintain the character of an honourable and good man? <lb/>
            and if he observes them, he will lose the character of the <lb/>
            messenger, and spy and herald of God." The conclusion <lb/>
            is that it is better for a minister of God not to marry.10</p>
          <p>Epictetus distinguishes the soul from the body in the <lb/>
            chapter (iv. c. 11) about purity (cleanliness); but he <lb/>
            wisely does not attempt to define the soul. He says, <lb/>
            " We suppose that there is something superior in man and <lb/>
            that we first receive it from the Gods: for since the Gods <lb/>
            by their nature are pure and free from corruption, so far <lb/>
            as men approach them by reason, so far do they cling to <lb/>
            purity and to a love (habit) of purity." It is however <lb/>
            impossible for man's nature to be altogether pure; but <lb/>
            reason endeavours to make human nature love purity. <lb/>
            " The first then and highest purity is that which is in the <lb/>
            soul; and we say the same of impurity. But you could <lb/>
            not discover the impurity of the soul as you could discover <note type="footnote"> 10 Dr. Farrar says in his Seekers after God' (Epictetus p. 213), <lb/>
            "That Epictetus approves of celibacy as a 'counsel of perfection,' and <lb/>
            indeed his views have a close and remarkable resemblance to those of <lb/>
            St. Paul." I do not understand the first part of this sentence; and <lb/>
            the reader of Epictetus will see that the second part is not true. There <lb/>
            is a note on the matter (pp. 258, 316). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xl"/>
            that of the body: but as to the soul, what else could you <lb/>
            find in it than that which makes it filthy in respect to the <lb/>
            acts which are her own ? Now the acts of the soul are <lb/>
            movement towards an object or movement from it, desire, <lb/>
            aversion, preparation, design (purpose), assent. What then <lb/>
            is it which in these acts makes the soul filthy and impure ? <lb/>
            Nothing else than her own bad judgments (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Κρίματα</foreign>). Con­ <lb/>
            sequently the impurity of the soul is the soul's bad <lb/>
            opinions; and the purification of the soul is the planting <lb/>
            in it of proper opinions; and the soul is pure which has <lb/>
            proper opinions, for the soul alone in her own acts is free <lb/>
            from perturbation and pollution."</p>
          <p>Epictetus says (iv. c. 7) that man is not flesh nor <lb/>
            bones nor sinews (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νευ̑ρα</foreign>), but he is that which makes use <lb/>
            of these parts of the body and governs them and follows <lb/>
            (understands) the appearances of things." This opinion <lb/>
            seems to be the same or nearly the same as Bp. Butler's <lb/>
            (iv. c. 7, note 10). If then Epictetus had any distinct <lb/>
            notion of the soul, and he is a man whose notions are <lb/>
            generally distinct, I think that his opinion of man's body <lb/>
            and of man's soul are, that a man's body is not the man, <lb/>
            but the body is that finely tempered clay" in which the <lb/>
            man dwells, and without the body he could not live this <lb/>
            earthly life: and his notion of the soul is that which is <lb/>
            stated above (iv. c. 11 and c. 7). As to the mode and nature <lb/>
            of this connexion between the body and the soul, I can <lb/>
            only suppose that he would have disclaimed all knowledge <lb/>
            of it, as he does of the nature of perception (p. 82); and <lb/>
            I do not suppose that any philosopher or theologian would <lb/>
            venture to say what this connexion of soul and body is. <lb/>
            In the life then which man lives on the earth I think that <lb/>
            the opinions of Epictetus are the same or nearly the same <lb/>
            as those of Swedenborg ;but after the event, which comes <lb/>
            to all men, and which we name Death, the opinions are <lb/>
            very different.</p><pb n="xli"/>
            
          <p>And what is Death? (p. 230 in the chapter on Solitude). <lb/>
            It is a going “ to the place from which you came, to your <lb/>
            friends and kinsmen, to the elements: what there was in <lb/>
            you of fire goes to fire, of earth to earth; of air (spirit) <lb/>
            to air; of water to water: no Hades, nor Acheron, nor <lb/>
            Cocytus, nor Pyriphlegethon, but all is full of Gods and <lb/>
            Daemons." He says (p. 282): “ death is a greater change, <lb/>
            not from the state which now is to that which is not, but <lb/>
            to that which is not now. Shall I then no longer exist ? <lb/>
            You will not exist, but you will be something else, of which <lb/>
            the world now has need: for you also came into existence <lb/>
            not when you chose, but when the world had need of you." <lb/>
            Death is the resolution of the matter of the body into the <lb/>
            things out of which it is composed (p. 347). This is dis­ <lb/>
            tinct and intelligible. Of the soul, which, as we have <lb/>
            seen, he considers to be in some way different from the <lb/>
            body during life, he does not speak so distinctly. I think <lb/>
            that he means, if he means any thing, something like what <lb/>
            I have said in p. 347, note 4.</p>
          <p>The philosopher, who appears to have no belief in a <lb/>
            future existence, as it is generally understood, teaches that <lb/>
            we ought to live such a life in all our thoughts and in all <lb/>
            our acts as a Christian would teach. He says (p. 285), <lb/>
            " Then in the place of all other delights substitute this, <lb/>
            that of being conscious that you are obeying God, that not <lb/>
            in word, but in deed you are performing the acts of a wise <lb/>
            and good man." He looks for no reward for doing what <lb/>
            he ought to do. The virtuous man has his reward in his <lb/>
            own acts. If he lives conformably to nature, he will do <lb/>
            what is best in this short life, and will obtain all the hap­ <lb/>
            piness which he can obtain in no ether way.</p>
          <p>He says (p. 310): “ Who are you and for what purpc<unclear>e</unclear> <lb/>
            did you come into the world ? Did not God introduce you <lb/>
            here, did he not show you the light, did he not give you <lb/>
            fellow workers, and perception and reason ? and as whom <lb/>
             <pb n="xlii"/>
            did he introduce you here? did he not introduce you as <lb/>
            subject to death, and as one to live on the earth with a <lb/>
            little flesh, and to observe his administration and to join <lb/>
            with him in the spectacle and the festival for a short time? <lb/>
            Will you not then, as long as you have been permitted, <lb/>
            after seeing the spectacle and the solemnity, when he leads <lb/>
            you out, go with adoration of him and thanks for what you <lb/>
            have heard and seen " ?</p>
          <p>Perhaps we may say that the conclusion of Epictetus <lb/>
            about the soul after the separation from the body is equiva­ <lb/>
            lent to a declaration that he knew nothing about it; as he <lb/>
            disclaims sometimes the knowledge of other things. We <lb/>
            cannot assume that in the books which are lost be ex­ <lb/>
            pressed any opinions which are inconsistent with thoso <lb/>
            contained in the books which exist. He must have known <lb/>
            the opinion of Socrates about the immortality of the soul, <lb/>
            or the opinion attributed to Socrates; but he has not said <lb/>
            that he assents to it, nor does he express dissent from it. <lb/>
            Bp. Butler in his Analogy of Religion Natural and Re­ <lb/>
            vealed (Part I. Of Natural Religion, Chap. I. of a Future <lb/>
            Life) has examined the question of a Future Life with his <lb/>
            usual modesty, good sense and sagacity. The inquiry is very <lb/>
            difficult. He says at the end of the chapter: " The credi­ <lb/>
            bility of a future life, which has been here insisted on, how <lb/>
            little soever it may satisfy our curiosity, seems to answer <lb/>
            all the purposes of religion, in like manner as a demon­ <lb/>
            strative proof would. Indeed, a proof, even a demon­ <lb/>
            strative one, of a future life, would not be a proof of <lb/>
            religion. For, that we are to live hereafter, is just as <lb/>
            reconcileable with the scheme of atheism, and as well to <lb/>
            be accounted for by it, as that we are now alive is; and <lb/>
            therefore nothing can be more absurd than to argue from <lb/>
            that scheme that there can be no future state. But as <lb/>
            religion implies a future state, any presumption against <lb/>
            such a state is a presumption against rel gion."</p><pb n="xliii"/>
            
          <p>I conclude that Epictetus, who was a religious man, and <lb/>
            who believed in the existence of God and his administra­ <lb/>
            tion of all things, did not deny a future life; nor does he <lb/>
            say that he believes it. I conclude that he did not under­ <lb/>
            stand it; that it was beyond his conception, as the nature of <lb/>
            God also was. His great merit as a teacher is that he <lb/>
            “ attempted to show that there is in man's nature and in <lb/>
            the constitution of things sufficient reason for living a <lb/>
            virtuous life."" He knew well what man's nature is, and <lb/>
            he endeavoured to teach us how we can secure happiness <lb/>
            in this life as far as we are capable of attaining it.</p>
          <p>More might be said; but this is enough. I will only <lb/>
            add that the Stoics have been charged with arrogance; and <lb/>
            the charge is just. Epictetus himself has been blamed <lb/>
            for it even by modern theologians, who are not always free <lb/>
            from this fault themselves. If there is any arrogance or <lb/>
            apparent arrogance in Epictetus, he did not teach it, for <lb/>
            he, has especially warned us against this fault, as the <lb/>
            reader will see in several passages. <note type="footnote"> 11 I am not sure that I rightly understood the Apostle Paul, when <lb/>
            I wrote the note 22 in p. 283. The words "Let us eat and drink, for <lb/>
            to-morrow we die," are said to be a quotation from a Greek writer. <lb/>
            The words then may be taken not as Paul's, but as the conclusion of <lb/>
            foolish persons. A friend who, as I understand his remarks, is of this <lb/>
            opinion, also adds that as Paul was a learned man, and knew some­ <lb/>
            thing about the Greek philosophers, he would certainly give them <lb/>
            credit for better and more rational opinions. This may be the true <lb/>
            meaning of the words. Paul is not always easy to understand, even <lb/>
            by those who make a special study of his Epistles. </note> <pb n="-"/>

          <p>I NEITHER wrote these Discourses 1 of Epictetus in the way <lb/>
            in which a man might write such things; nor did I make <lb/>
            them public myself, inasmuch as I declare that I did not <lb/>
            even write them. But whatever I heard him say, the <lb/>
            same I attempted to write down in his own words as <lb/>
            nearly as possible, for the purpose of preserving them as <lb/>
            memorials to myself afterwards of the thoughts and the <lb/>
            freedom of speech of Epictetus. Accordingly, the Dis­ <lb/>
            courses are naturally such as a man would address with­ <lb/>
            out preparation to another, not such as a man would writt <note type="footnote"> 1 A. Gellius (i. 2 and xvii. 19) speaks of the Discourses of Epictetus <lb/>
            being arranged by Arrian; and Gellius (xix. 1) speaks of a fifth book <lb/>
            of these Discourses, but only four are extant and some fragments. The <lb/>
            whole number of books was eight, as Photius (Cod. 58) says. There <lb/>
            is also extant an Encheiridion or Manual, consisting of short pieces <lb/>
            selected from the Discourses of Epictetus; and there is the valuable <lb/>
            commentary on the Encheiridion written by Simplicius in the sixth <lb/>
            century A.D. and in the reign of Justinian. </note><note type="footnote"> Arrian explains in a manner what he means by saying that he did <lb/>
            not write these Discourses of Epictetus; but he does not explain his <lb/>
            meaning when he says that he did not make them public. He tells <lb/>
            us that he did attempt to write down in the words of Epictetus what <lb/>
            the philosopher said; but how it happened that they were first pub­ <lb/>
            lished, without his knowledge or consent, Arrian does not say. It <lb/>
            appears, however, that he did see the Discourses when they were <lb/>
            published; and as Schweighaeuser remarks, he would naturally correct <lb/>
            any errors that he detected, and so there would be an edition revised <lb/>
            by himself. Schweighaeuser has a note (i. ch. 26,13) on the difficulties <lb/>
            which we now find in the Discourses. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>

            with the view of others reading them. Now, being such, <lb/>
            I do not know how they fell into the hands of the public, <lb/>
            without either my consent or my knowledge. But it <lb/>
            concerns me little if I shall be considered incompetent <lb/>
            to write; and it concerns Epictetus not at all if any man <lb/>
            shall despise his words; for at the time when he uttered <lb/>
            them, it was plain that he had no other purpose than to <lb/>
            move the minds of his hearers to the best things. If, indeed, <lb/>
            these Discourses should produce this effect, they will have, <lb/>
            I think, the result which the words of philosophers ought <lb/>
            to have. But if they shall not, let those who read them <lb/>
            know that, when Epictetus delivered them, the hearer <lb/>
            could not avoid being affected in the way that Epictetus <lb/>
            wished him to be. But if the Discourses themselves, <lb/>
            as they are written, do not effect this result, it may be <lb/>
            that the fault is mine, or, it may be, that the thing is <lb/>
            unavoidable.</p>

          <p>OF all the faculties (except that which I shall soon men­ <lb/>
            tion), you will find not one which is capable of contem­ <lb/>
            plating itself, and, consequently, not capable either of <lb/>
            approving or disapproving.1 How far does the grammatic <lb/>
            art possess the contemplating power ? As far as forming <lb/>
            a judgment about what is written and spoken. And how <lb/>
            far music? As far as judging about melody. Does <lb/>
            either of them then contemplate itself? By no means. <lb/>
            But when you must write something to your friend, <lb/>
            grammar will tell you what words you should write; but <lb/>
            whether you should write or not, grammar will not tell <lb/>
            you. And so it is with music as to musical sounds; but <lb/>
            whether you should sing at the present time and play on <lb/>
            the lute, or do neither, music will not tell you. What <lb/>
            faculty then will tell you? That which contemplates <lb/>
            both itself and all other things. And what is this faculty ? <lb/>
            The rational faoulty;2 for this is the only faculty that we <note type="footnote"> 1 " This moral approving and disapproving faculty ” is Bp. Butler’s <lb/>

            tells us that golden things are beautiful, for they do not <lb/>
            say so themselves? Evidently it is the faculty which is <lb/>
            capable of judging of appearances.3 What else judges of <lb/>
            music, grammar, and the oth(r faculties, proves their uses, <lb/>
            and points out the occasions for using them? Nothing <lb/>
            else.</p>
          <p>As then it was fit to be so, that which is best of <lb/>
            all and supreme over all is the only thing which the <lb/>
            gods have placed in our power, the right use of appear­ <lb/>
            ances ; but all other things they have not placed in our <lb/>
            power. Was it because they did not choose ? I indeed <lb/>
            think that, if they had been able, they would have put <lb/>
            these other things also in our power, but they certainly <lb/>
            could not.4 For as we exist on the earth, and are bound <lb/>
            to such a body and to such companions, how was it pos­ <lb/>
            sible for us not to be hindered as to these things by <lb/>
            externals ?</p>
          <p>• But what says Zeus? Epictetus, if it were possible, <lb/>
            I would have made both your little body and your little <lb/>
            property free and not exposed to hindrance. But now be <lb/>
            not ignorant of this: this body is not yours, but it is clay <lb/>
            finely tempered. And since I was not able to do for you <note type="footnote"> 3 This is what he has just named the rational faculty. The Stoics <lb/>
            gave the name of appearances (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Φαντασίαι</foreign>) to all impressions received <lb/>
            by the senses, and to all emotions caused by external things. Chry­ <lb/>
            sippus said: <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φαντασία ἐστὶ πάθος ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ γινόμενον, ἐνδεικνύμενον <lb/>
            ἑαυτότε καὶ τὸ πεποιηκός</foreign> (Plutarch, iv. c. 12, Do Placit. Philosoph.). </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Compare Antoninus, ii. 3. Epictetus does not intend to limit the <lb/>
            power of the gods, but he means that the constitution of things being <lb/>
            what it is, they cannot do contradictories. They have so constituted <lb/>
            things that man is hindered by externals. How then could they <lb/>
            give to man a power of not being hindered by externals? Seneca <lb/>
            (De Providentia, c. 6) says: " But it may be said, many things <lb/>
            happen which cause sadness, fear, and are hard to bear. Because <lb/>
            (God says) I could not save you from them, I have armed your minds <lb/>
            against all." This is the answer to those who imagine that they have <lb/>
            disproved the common assertion of the omnipotence of God, when <lb/>
            they ask whether He can combine inherent contradictions, whether He <lb/>
            can cause two and two to make five. This is indeed a very absurd <lb/>
            way of talking. </note> <lb/>

            what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion <lb/>
            of us,5 this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it, <lb/>
            and the faculty of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the <lb/>
            faculty of using the appearances of things; and if you will <lb/>
            take care of this faculty and consider it your only posses­ <lb/>
            sion, you will never be hindered, never meet with impedi­ <lb/>
            ments ; you will not lament, you will not blame, you will <lb/>
            not flatter any person.</p>
          <p>Well, do these seem to you small matters? I hope <lb/>
            not. Be content with them then and pray to the <lb/>
            gods. But now when it is in our power to look after <lb/>
            one thing, and to attach ourselves to it, we prefer to look <lb/>
            after many things, and to be bound to many things, to <lb/>
            the body and to property, and to brother and to friend, <lb/>
            and to child and to slave. Since then we are bound to <lb/>
            many things, we are depressed by them and dragged down. <lb/>
            For this reason, when the weather is not fit for sailing, we <lb/>
            sit down and torment ourselves, and continually look out <lb/>
            to see what wind is blowing. It is north. What is that <lb/>
            to us ? When will the west wind blow? When it shall <lb/>
            choose, my good man, or when it shall please Aeolus; for <lb/>
            God has not made you the manager of the winds, but <lb/>
            Aeolus.6 What then? We must make the best use that <lb/>
            we can of the things which are in our power, and use the <lb/>
            rest according to their nature. What is their nature <lb/>
            then ? As God may please.</p>
          <p>Must I then alone have my head cut off? What, would <lb/>

            ance, and of desire and aversion, and even the faculty of using <lb/>
            appearances, belong to animals as well as to man : but animals in <lb/>
            using appearances are moved by passion only, and do not understand <lb/>
            what they are doing, while in man these passions are under his <lb/>

            remove the difficulty about these animal passions being called “a <lb/>
            small portion of us (the gods)." Schweighaeuser, however, though he <lb/>
            sees the difficulty, does not accept the emendation. Perhaps Arrian <lb/>

              did at Rome when Nero ordered him to be beheaded ? <lb/>
              For when he had stretched out his neck, and received a <lb/>
              feeble blow, which made him draw it in for a moment, he <lb/>
              stretched it out again. And a little before, when he was <lb/>
              visited by Epaphroditus,8 Nero's freedman, who asked him <lb/>
              about the cause of offence which he had given, he said, “If <lb/>
              I choose to toll anything, I will tell your master."</p>

            is not permitted to me. I must die. Must I then die <lb/>
            lamenting ? I must be put in chains. Must I then also <lb/>
            lament? I must go into exile. Does any man then <lb/>
            hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and <lb/>
            contentment ? Tell me the secret which you possess. I <lb/>
            will not, for this is in my power. But I will put you in <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>To the rational animal only is the irrational intolerable; <lb/>
            but that which is rational is tolerable. Blows are not <lb/>
            naturally intolerable. How is that ? See how the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians 1 endure whipping when they have learned that <lb/>
            whipping is consistent with reason. To hang yourself is <lb/>
            not intolerable. When then you have the opinion that it <lb/>
            is rational, you go and hang yourself. In short, if we <lb/>
            observe, we shall find that the animal man is pained by <lb/>
            nothing so much as by that which is irrational; and, on <lb/>
            the contrary, attracted to nothing so much as to that <lb/>
            which is rational.</p>
          <p>But the rational and the irrational appear such in a <lb/>
            different way to different persons, just as the good and the <lb/>
            bad, the profitable and the unprofitable. For this reason, <lb/>
            particularly, we need discipline, in order to learn how to <lb/>
            adapt the preconception 2 of the rational and the irrational <lb/>
            to the several things conformably to nature. But in order <lb/>
            to determine the rational and the irrational, we use not <lb/>
            only the estimates of external things, but we consider also <note type="footnote"> 1 The Spartan boys used to be whipped at the altar of Artemis <lb/>

            ence between empirical knowledge and knowledge a priori, that is, <lb/>
            sensation (as the material of observation), it follows that this sen­ <lb/>
            sation is specially that which cannot be anticipated (it cannot be a <lb/>

            what is appropriate to each person. For to one man it is <lb/>
            consistent with reason to hold a chamber pot for another, <lb/>
            and to look to this only, that if he does not hold it, he will <lb/>
            receive stripes, and he will not receive his food : but if he <lb/>
            shall hold the pot, he will not suffer anything hard or dis­ <lb/>
            agreeable. But to another man not only does the holding <lb/>
            of a chamber pot appear intolerable for himself, but in­ <lb/>
            tolerable also for him to allow another to do this office for <lb/>
            him. If then you ask me whether you should hold the <lb/>
            chamber pot or not, I shall say to you that the receiving <lb/>
            of food is worth more than the not receiving of it, and the <lb/>
            being scourged is a greater indignity than not being <lb/>
            scourged; so that if you measure your interests by these <lb/>
            things, go and hold the chamber pot. “ But this," you <lb/>
            say, “ would not be worthy of me." Well then, it is you <lb/>
            who must introduce this consideration into the inquiry, <lb/>
            not 1; for it is you who know yourself, how much you are <lb/>
            worth to yourself, and at what price you sell yourself; for <lb/>
            men sell themselves at various prices.</p>
          <p>For this reason, when Florus was deliberating whether <lb/>
            he should go down to Nero's 3 spectacles, and also perform <lb/>
            in them himself, Agrippinus said to him, Go down : <lb/>
            and when Florus asked Agrippinus, Why do not you go <lb/>
            down? Agrippinus replied, Because I do not even dell­ <lb/>
            berate about the matter. For he who has once brought <lb/>
            himself to deliberate about such matters, and to calculate <lb/>
            the value of external things, comes very near to thoso <lb/>
            who have forgotten their own character. For why do you <lb/>
            ask me the question, whether death is preferable or life ? <lb/>
            I say life. Pain or pleasure ? I say pleasure. But if I <lb/>
            do not take a part in the tragic acting, I shall have my <lb/>
            head struck off. Go then and take a part, but I will not. <lb/>
            Why? Because you consider yourself to be only one <lb/>
            thread of those which are in the tunic. Well then it was <lb/>
            fitting for you to take care how you should be like the rest <lb/>
            of men, just as the thread has no design to be anything <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Nero was passionately fond of scenic representations, and used to <lb/>
            induce the descendants of noble families, whose poverty made them <lb/>
            consent, to appear on the stage (Tacitus, Annals, xiv. 14; Suetonius <lb/>
            Nero, c. 21). </note> <lb/>

            superior to the other threads. But I wish to be purple,4 <lb/>
            that small part which is bright, and makes all the rest <lb/>
            appear graceful and beautiful. Why then do you tell me <lb/>
            to make myself like the many ? and if I do, how shall I <lb/>
            still be purple ?</p>
          <p>Priscus Helvidius also saw this, and acted conformably. <lb/>
            For when Vespasian sent and commanded hint not to go <lb/>
            into the senate, he replied, “ It is in your power not to <lb/>
            allow me to be a member of the senate, but so long as I <lb/>
            am, I must go in." Well, go in then, says the em­ <lb/>
            peror, but say nothing. Do not ask my opinion, and <lb/>
            I will be silent. But I must ask your opinion. And <lb/>
            I must say what I think right. But if you do, I <lb/>
            shall put you to death. When then did I tell you <lb/>
            that I am immortal? You will do your part, and I <lb/>
            will do mine: it is your part to kill; it is mine to die, <lb/>
            but not in fear: yours to banish me; mine to depart <lb/>
            without sorrow.</p>
          <p>What good then did Priscus do, who was only a single <lb/>
            person ? And what good does the purple do for the toga ? <lb/>
            Why, what else than this, that it is conspicuous in the <lb/>
            toga as purple, and is displayed also as a fine example to <lb/>
            all other things? But in such circumstances another <lb/>
            would have replied to Caesar who forbade him to enter the <lb/>
            senate, I thank you for sparing me. But such a man <lb/>
            Vespasian would not even have forbidden to enter the <lb/>
            senate, for he knew that he would either sit there like an <lb/>
            earthen vessel, or, if he spoke, he would say what Caesar <lb/>
            wished, and add even more. <note type="footnote"> 4 The “ purple " is the broad purple border on the toga named tho <lb/>
            toga praetexta, worn by certain Roman magistrat, s and some others, <lb/>
            and by senators, it is said, on certain days (Cic. Phil, ii. 43). </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Helvidius Priscus, a Roman senator and a philosopher, is com­ <lb/>
            mended by Tacitus (Hist. iv. 4, 5) as an honest man: “ He followed <lb/>
            the philosophers who considered those things only to be good which <lb/>
            are virtuous, those only to be bad which are foul; and he reckoned <lb/>
            power, rank, and all other things which are external to the mind as <lb/>
            neither good nor bad." Vespasian, probably in a fit of passion, being <lb/>
            provoked by Helvidius, ordered him to be put to death, and then <lb/>
            revoked the order when it was too late (Suetonius, Vespasianus, <lb/>
            c. 15). </note> <pb n="11"/>

          <p>In this way an athlete also acted who was in danger of <lb/>
            dying unless his private parts were amputated. His <lb/>
            brother came to the athlete, who was a philosopher, and <lb/>
            said, Come, brother, what are you going to do ? Shall we <lb/>
            amputate this member and return to the gymnasium ? <lb/>
            But the athlete persisted in his resolution and died. <lb/>
            When some one asked Epictetus, How he did this, as an <lb/>
            athlete or a philosopher ? As a man, Epictetus replied, <lb/>
            and a man who had been proclaimed among the athletes at <lb/>
            the Olympic games and had contended in them, a man who <lb/>
            had been familiar with such a place, and not merely <lb/>
            anointed in Baton's school.6 Another would have allowed <lb/>
            even his head to bo cut off, if he could have lived without <lb/>
            it. Such is that regard to character which is so strong in <lb/>
            those who have been accustomed to introduce it of them­ <lb/>
            selves and conjoined with other things into their de­ <lb/>
            liberations.</p>
          <p>Come then, Epictetus, shave 7 yourself. If I am a philo­ <lb/>
            sopher, I answer, I will not shave myself. But I will take <lb/>
            off your head ? If that will do you any good, take it off.</p>
          <p>Some person asked, how then shall every man among <lb/>
            us perceive what is suitable to his character? How, lie <lb/>
            replied, does the bull alone, when the lion has attacked, <lb/>
            discover his own powers and put himself forward in <lb/>
            defence of the whole herd? It is plain that with the <lb/>
            powers the perception of having them is immediately con­ <lb/>
            joined: and, therefore, whoever of us has such powers <lb/>
            will not be ignorant of them. Now a bull is not made sud­ <lb/>
            denly, nor a biave man; but we must discipline ourselves <lb/>
            in the winter for the summer campaign, and not rashly <lb/>

          <p>Only consider at what price you sell your own will: if <lb/>

          <p>IF a man should be able to assent to this doctrine as he <lb/>
            ought, that we are all sprung from God in an especial <lb/>
            manner, and that God is the father both of men and of <lb/>
            gods, I suppose that he would never have any ignoble <lb/>
            or mean thoughts about himself. But if Caesar (the <lb/>
            emperor) should adopt you, no one could endure your <lb/>
            arrogance; and if you know that you are the son of Zeus, <lb/>
            will you not be elated ? Yet we do not so; but since <note type="footnote"> 3 The text is: <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ δὲ μὴ ού χείρων</foreign>. The sense seems to be: Epic­ <lb/>

            these two things are mingled in the generation of man, <lb/>
            body in common with the animals, and reason and intelli. <lb/>
            gence in common with the gods, many incline to this kin­ <lb/>
            ship, which is miserable and mortal; and some few to that <lb/>
            which is divine and happy. Since then it is of necessity <lb/>
            that every man uses everything according to the opinion <lb/>
            which he has about it, those, the few, who think that they <lb/>
            are formed for fidelity and modesty and a sure use of <lb/>
            appearances have no mean or ignoble thoughts about <lb/>
            themselves ; but with the many it is quite the contrary. <lb/>
            For they say, What am I? A poor, miserable man, with <lb/>
            my wretched bit of flesh. Wretched, indeed; but you pos­ <lb/>
            sess something better than your bit of flesh. Why then <lb/>
            do you neglect that which is better, and why do you <lb/>
            attach yourself to this ?</p>
          <p>Through this kinship with the flesh, some of us in­ <lb/>
            clining to it become like wolves, faithless and treacherous <lb/>
            and mischievous: some become like lions, savage and <lb/>
            bestial and untamed; but the greater part of us become <lb/>
            foxes, and other worse animals. For what else is a <lb/>
            slanderer and a malignant man than a fox, or some other <lb/>
            more wretched and meaner animal ? See 2 then and take <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>HE who is making progress, having learned from philoso­ <lb/>
            phers that desire means the desire of good things, and <lb/>
            aversion means aversion from bad things; having learned <note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρᾶτε</foreign> Kal <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσέχετε μή τι τούτων ἀποβη̑τε τῶν ἀτυχημάτων</foreign>. Upto <unclear/> <lb/>

            Upton remarks that many expressions in Epictetus are not unlike the <lb/>
            style of the Gospels, which were written in the same period in which <lb/>
            Epictetus was teaching. Schweighaeuscr also refers to Wetstein’s <lb/>

            too that happiness1 and tranquillity are not attainable by <lb/>
            man otherwise than by not failing to obtain what he desires, <lb/>
            and not falling into that which he would avoid; such a <lb/>
            man takes from himself desire altogether and defers it,2 <lb/>
            but he employs his aversion only on things which are de­ <lb/>
            pendent on his will. For if he attempts to avoid anything <lb/>
            independent of his will, lie knows that sometimes he will <lb/>
            fall in with something which he wishes to avoid, and he <lb/>
            will be unhappy. Now if virtue promises good fortune <lb/>
            and tranquillity and happiness, certainly also the progress <lb/>
            towards virtue is progress towards each of these things. <lb/>
            For it is always true that to whatever point the perfecting <lb/>
            of anything leads us, progress is an approach towards this <lb/>
            point.</p>
          <p>How then do we admit that virtue is such as I have <lb/>
            said, and yet seek progress in other things and make a dis­ <lb/>
            play of it ? What is the product of virtue ? Tranquillity. <lb/>
            Who then makes improvement? Is it he who has read <lb/>
            many books of Chrysippus ? 3 But does virtue consist in <lb/>
            having understood Chrysippus ? If this is so, progress is <lb/>
            clearly nothing else than knowing a great deal of Ohry­ <lb/>
            sippus. But now we admit that virtue produces one <lb/>
            thing, and we declare that approaching near to it is <lb/>
            another thing, namely, progress or improvement. Such a <lb/>
            person, says one, is already able to read Chrysippus by <lb/>
            himself. Indeed, sir, you are making great progress. <lb/>
            What kind of progress? But why do you mock the man? <lb/>
            Why do you draw him away from the perception of his <lb/>
            own misfortunes? Will you not show him the effect of <lb/>
            virtue that he may learn whore to look for improvement? <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ εύρουν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ εὔροια</foreign> is translated “ happiness." The notion is <lb/>

            in every matter that occurs he works out his chief prin­ <lb/>

            is the man who has not travelled in vain. But if he has <lb/>
            strained his efforts to the practice of reading books, and <lb/>

            man's strength or the teacher's weakness; for when the <lb/>
            man, though he has been confuted,2 is hardened like a <lb/>
            stone, how shall we then be able to deal with him by <lb/>
            argument ?</p>
          <p>Now there are two kinds of hardening, one of the un­ <lb/>
            derstanding, the other of the sense of shame, when a man <lb/>
            is resolved not to assent to what is manifest nor to desist <lb/>
            from contradictions. Most of us are afraid of mortification <lb/>
            of the body, and would contrive all means to avoid such a <lb/>
            thing, but we care not about the soul's mortification. And <lb/>
            indeed with regard to the soul, if a man be in such a state <lb/>
            as not to apprehend anything, or understand at all, we <lb/>
            think that be is in a bad condition: but if the sense of <lb/>
            shame and modesty are deadened, this we call even power <lb/>
            ( or strength).</p>
          <p>Do you comprehend that you are awake? I do not, the <lb/>
            man replies, for I do not even comprehend when in my <lb/>
            sleep I imagine that I am awake. Does this appearance <lb/>
            then not differ from the other? Not at all, he replies. <lb/>
            Shall I still argue with this man? 3 And what fire or <lb/>
            what iron shall I apply to him to make him feel that he is <lb/>
            deadened ? He does perceive, but he pretends that he <lb/>
            does not. He is even worse than a dead man. He does <lb/>
            not see the contradiction: he is in a bad condition. <lb/>
            Another does see it, but he is not moved, and makes no <lb/>
            improvement : he is even in a worse condition. His <lb/>
            modesty is extirpated, and his sense of shame; and the <lb/>
            rational faculty has not been cut off from him, but it is <lb/>
            brutalised. Shall I name this strength of mind? Cer­ <lb/>

            the use of things which are and which happen; another <lb/>
            will not be thankful for them, even if he docs know them. <lb/>
            If God had made colours, but had not made the faculty of <lb/>
            seeing them, what would have been their use ? None at <lb/>
            all. On the other hand, if He had made the faculty of <lb/>
            vision, but had not made objects such as to fall under the <lb/>
            faculty, what in that case also would have been the use <lb/>
            of it? None at all. Well, suppose that He had made <lb/>
            both, but had not made light? In that case, also, they <lb/>
            would have been of no use. Who is it then who has <lb/>
            fitted this to that and that to this ? And who is it that <lb/>
            has fitted the knife to the case and the case to the knife ? <lb/>
            Is it no one?1 And, indeed, from the very structure of <lb/>
            things which have attained their completion, we are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to show that the work is certainly the act of some <lb/>
            artificer, and that it has not been constructed without a <lb/>
            purpose. Does then each of these things demonstrate the <lb/>
            workman, and do not visible things and the faculty of <lb/>
            seeing and light demonstrate Him ? And the existence of <lb/>
            male and female, and the desire of each for conjunction, <lb/>
            and the power of using the parts which are constructed, <lb/>
            do not even these declare the workman ? If they do not, <lb/>
            let us consider2 the constitution of our understanding <note type="footnote"> 1 Goethe has a short poem, entitled Gleich und Gleich (Like and <lb/>
            Like): <lb/>

            according to which, when we meet with sensible objects, <lb/>
            we do not simply receive impressions from them, but we <lb/>
            also select3 something from them, and subtract something, <lb/>
            and add, and compound by means of them these things or <lb/>
            those, and, in fact, pass from some to other things which, <lb/>
            in a manner, resemble them: is not even this sufficient <lb/>
            to move some men, and to induce them not to forget the <lb/>
            workman? If not so, let them explain to us what it is <lb/>
            that makes each several thing, or how it is possible that <lb/>
            things so wonderful and like the contrivances of art <lb/>
            should exist by chance and from their own proper motion ?</p>
          <p>What, then, are those things done in us only ? Many, <lb/>
            indeed, in us only, of which the rational animal had <lb/>
            peculiarly need; but you will find many common to us <lb/>
            with irrational animals. Do they then understand what <lb/>
            is done ? By no means. For use is one thing, and under­ <lb/>
            standing is another: God had need of irrational animals <lb/>
            to make use of appearances, but of us to understand the <lb/>
            use of appearances.4 It is therefore enough for them to <lb/>
            eat and to drink, and to sleep and to copulate, and to do all <lb/>
            the other things which they severally do. But for us, to <lb/>
            whom He has given also the intellectual faculty, these <lb/>
            things are not sufficient; for unless we act in a proper <lb/>
            and orderly manner, and conformably to the nature and <lb/>
            constitution of each thing, we shall never attain our true <lb/>
            end. For where the constitutions of living beings are <lb/>
            different, there also the acts and the ends are different. <lb/>
            In those animals then whose constitution is adapted only <lb/>
            to use, use alone is enough: but in an animal (man), which <lb/>
            has also the power of understanding the use, unless there <lb/>
            be the due exercise of the understanding, he will never <lb/>
            attain his proper end. Well then God constitutes every <lb/>
            animal, one to be eaten, another to serve for agriculture, <lb/>
            another to supply cheese, and another for some like use; <lb/>
            for which purposes what need is there to understand <lb/>
            appearances and to be able to distinguish them? But God <lb/>
            has introduced man to be a spectator of God and of His <note type="footnote"> 3 Cicero, De Off. i. c. 4, on the difference between man and beast. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 See Schweig.’s note, tom. ii. p. 84. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 The original is <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὺτοῦ</foreign>, which I refer to God; but it may be am­ <lb/>

             <pb n="21"/>
            works; and not only a spectator of them, but an interpreter. <lb/>
            For this reason it is shameful for man to begin and to end <lb/>
            where irrational animals do; but rather he ought to begin <lb/>
            where they begin, and to end where nature ends in us; <lb/>
            and nature ends in contemplation and understanding, and <lb/>
            in a way of life conformable to nature. Take care then <lb/>
            not to die without having been spectators of these things.</p>
          <p>But you take a journey to Olympia to see the work of <lb/>
            Phidias,6 and all of 3you think it a misfortune to die with­ <lb/>
            out having seen such things. But when there is no need <lb/>
            to take a journey, and where a man is, there he has the <lb/>
            works (of God) before him, will you not desire to see and <lb/>
            understand them? Will you not perceive either7 what <lb/>
            you are, or what you were born for, or what this is for <lb/>
            which you have received the faculty of sight ? But you <lb/>
            may say, there are some things disagreeable and trouble­ <lb/>
            some in life. And are there none at Olympia? Are you <lb/>
            not scorched ? Are you not pressed by a crowd? Are <lb/>
            you not without comfortable means of bathing ? Are you <lb/>
            not wet when it rains ? Have you not abundance of noise, <lb/>
            clamour, and other disagreeable things ? But I suppose <lb/>
            that setting all these things off against the magnificence of <lb/>
            the spectacle, you bear and endure. Well then and have <note type="footnote"> that man should be a spectator of himself, according to the maxim, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τνῶθι σεαυτόν</foreign>. It is true that man can in a manner contemplate <lb/>
            himself and his faculties as well as external objects; and as every <lb/>
            man can be an object to every other man, so a man may be an object <lb/>
            to himself when he examines his faculties and reflects on his own <lb/>
            acts. Schweighaeuscr asks how can a man be a spectator of God, <lb/>
            except so far as he is a spectator of God's works? It is not enough <lb/>
            he says, to reply that God and the universe, whom and which man <lb/>
            contemplates, are the same thing to the Stoics ; for Epictetus always <lb/>
            distinguishes God the maker and governor of the universe from the <lb/>
            universe itself. But here lies the difficulty. The universe is an <lb/>
            all-comprehensive term : it is all that wo can in any way perceive and <lb/>
            conceive as existing; and it may therefore comprehend God, not as <lb/>
            something distinct from the universe, but as being the universe him­ <lb/>
            self. This form of expression is an acknowledgment of the weakness of <lb/>
            the human faculties, and contains the implicit assertion of Locke that <lb/>
            the notion of God is beyond man's understanding (Essay, etc. ii. c. 17). </note><note type="footnote"> 6 This work was the colossal chryselephantine statue of Zeus <lb/>

            clear out ? And what would he have been doing if there <lb/>
            had been nothing of the kind? Is it not plain that he <lb/>
            would have wrapped himself up and have slept? In the <lb/>
            first place then he would not have been a Hercules, when <lb/>
            he was dreaming away all his life in such luxury and ease; <lb/>
            and even if he had been one, what would have been the <lb/>
            use of him ? and what the use of his arms, and of the <lb/>
            strength of the other parts of his body, and his endurance <lb/>
            and noble spirit, if such circumstances and occasions had <lb/>
            not roused and exercised him? Well then must a man <lb/>
            provide for himself such means of exercise, and seek to in­ <lb/>
            troduce a lion from some place into his country, and a boar, <lb/>
            and a hydra ? This would be folly and madness: but a,; <lb/>
            they did exist, and were found, they were useful for show­ <lb/>
            ing what Hercules was and for exercising him. Come <lb/>
            then do you also having observed these things look to the <lb/>
            faculties which you have, and when you have looked at <lb/>
            them, say: Bring now, 0 Zeus, any difficulty that thou <lb/>

            You do not so: but you sit still, trembling for fear that <lb/>
            some things will happen, and weeping, and lamenting, and <lb/>
            groaning for what does happen : and then you blame the <lb/>

            these faculties free from hindrance, subject to no compul­ <lb/>

            relates to the duties of life, though the many do not know <lb/>
            this truth. For in every matter wo inquire how the wise <lb/>

            proper method of dealing with the matter. Let then <lb/>
            people either say that the grave man will not descend into <lb/>
            the contest of question and answer, or, that if he does <lb/>
            descend into the contest, he will take no care about not <lb/>
            conducting himself rashly or carelessly in questioning and <lb/>
            answering. But if they do not allow either the one or the <lb/>
            other of these things, they must admit that some inquiry <lb/>
            ought to be made into those topics (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τόπων</foreign>) on which par­ <lb/>
            ticularly questioning and answering are employed. For <lb/>
            what is the end proposed in reasoning ? To establish true <lb/>
            propositions, to remove the false, to withhold assent from <lb/>
            those which are not plain. Is it enough then to have <lb/>
            learned only this ? It is enough, a man may reply. Is <lb/>
            it then also enough for a man, who would not make a <lb/>
            mistake in the use of coined money, to have heard this <lb/>
            precept, that he should receive the genuine drachmae and <lb/>
            reject the spurious? It is not enough. What then ought <lb/>
            to be added to this precept ? What else than the faculty <lb/>
            which proves and distinguishes the genuine and the spurious <lb/>
            drachmae ? Consequently also in reasoning what has been <lb/>
            said is not enough; but it is necessary that a man should <lb/>
            acquire the faculty of examining and distinguishing the <lb/>
            true and the false, and that which is not plain? It is <lb/>
            necessary. Besides this, what is proposed in reasoning? <lb/>
            That you should accept what follows from that which you <lb/>
            have properly granted. Well, is it then enough in this <lb/>
            case also to know this? It is not enough; but a man <lb/>
            must learn how one thing is a consequence of other things, <lb/>
            and when one thing follows from one thing, and when it <lb/>
            follows from seveial collectively. Consider then if it be <lb/>
            not necessary that this power should also be acquired by <lb/>
            him, who purposes to conduct himself skilfully in reason­ <lb/>
            ing, the power of demonstrating himself the several <lb/>
            things which he has proposed,2 and the power of under­ <lb/>
            standing the demonstrations of others, and of not being <lb/>
            deceived by sophists, as if they were demonstrating. <lb/>
            Therefore there has arisen among us the practice and <note type="footnote"> 2 See Schweig,’s note on <foreign xml:lang="grc">άποδείξειν ἓκαστα άποδόντα</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            exercise of conclusive arguments 3 and figures, and it has <lb/>
            been shown to be necessary.</p>
          <p>But in fact in some cases we have properly granted the <lb/>
            premises4 or assumptions, and there results from them <lb/>
            something; and though it is not true, yet none the less it <lb/>
            does result. What then ought I to do ? Ought I to admit <lb/>
            the falsehood ? And how is that possible ? Well, should I <lb/>
            say that I did not properly grant that which we agreed <lb/>
            upon? But you are not allowed to do even this. Shall I <lb/>
            then say that the consequence does not arise through what <lb/>
            has been conceded? But neither is this allowed. What then <lb/>
            must be done in this case? Consider if it is not this : as <lb/>
            to have borrowed is not enough to make a man still a <lb/>
            debtor, but to this must be added the fact that he continues <lb/>
            to owe the money and that the debt is not paid, so it is not <lb/>
            enough to compel you to admit the inference5 that you have <lb/>
            granted the premises (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ λήμματα</foreign>), but you must abide <lb/>
            by what you have granted. Indeed, if the premises con­ <lb/>
            tinue to the end such as they were when they were granted, <lb/>
            it is absolutely necessary for us to abide by what we have <lb/>
            gi anted, and we must accept their consequences: but if <lb/>

            clusion, which, however, is false; and it is not a conclusion derived <lb/>
            from the premises to which we assented. A ridiculous example is <lb/>
            given by Seneca, Ep. 48: "Mus syllaba est: mus autem caseum <lb/>
            rodit: syllaba ergo cabeum rodit." Seneca laughs at this absurdity, <lb/>
            and says perhaps the following syllogism (collectio) may be a bettor <lb/>
            example of acuteness: "Mus syllaba est: syllaba autem caseum non <lb/>
            rodit: mus ergo caseum non rodit." One is as good as the other. We <lb/>
            know that neither conclusion is true, and we see where the error IS. <lb/>
            Menage says that though the Stoics particularly cultivated logic, <lb/>
            some of them despised it, and he mentions Seneca, Epictetus, and <lb/>
            Marcus Antoninus. Upton, however, observes that Epictetus and <lb/>
            Marcus Antoninus did not despise logic (hesays nothing about <lb/>
            Seneca), but employed it for their own purposes. </note><note type="footnote"> It has been observed that if a man is asked whether, if every A is </note> <lb/>

            were granted, it is absolutely necessary for us also to with­ <lb/>
            draw from what we granted, and from accepting what does <lb/>
            not follow from the words in which our concessions were <lb/>
            made. For the inference is now not our inference, nor does <lb/>
            it result with our assent, since we have withdrawn from the <lb/>
            premises which we granted. We ought then both to ex­ <lb/>
            amine such kinds of premises, and such change and varia­ <lb/>
            tion of them (from one meaning to another), by which in <lb/>
            the course of questioning or answering, or in making the <lb/>
            syllogistic conclusion, or in any other such way, the pre­ <lb/>
            mises undergo variations, and give occasion to the foolish <lb/>
            to be confounded, if they do not see what conclusions <lb/>
            (consequences) are. For what reason ought we to ex­ <lb/>
            amine ? In order that we may not in this matter be <lb/>
            employed in an improper manner nor in a confused way.</p>
          <p>And the same in hypotheses and hypothetical arguments ; <lb/>
            for it is necessary sometimes to demand the granting of <lb/>
            some hypothesis as a kind of passage to the argument <lb/>
            which follows. Must we then allow every hypothesis that <lb/>
            is proposed, or not allow every one ? And if not every <lb/>
            one, which should we allow ? And if a man has allowed <lb/>
            an hypothesis, must he in every case abide by allowing <lb/>
            it ? or must he sometimes withdraw from it, but admit the <lb/>
            consequences and not admit contradictions? Yes; but <lb/>
            suppose that a man says, If you admit the hypothesis of <lb/>
            a possibility, I will draw you to an impossibility. With <lb/>
            such a person shall a man of sense refuse to enter into a <lb/>
            contest, and avoid discussion and conversation with him ? <lb/>
            But what other man than the man of sense can use argu­ <lb/>
            mentation and is skilful in questioning and answering, and <note type="footnote"> B, every B is also A, he might answer that it is. But if you put the <lb/>
            conversion in this material form: "Every goose is an animal," he <lb/>
            immediately perceives that he cannot say, “Every animal is a goose." <lb/>
            What does this show ? It shows that the man's comprehension of the <lb/>
            proposition, every A is B, was not true, and that he took it to mean <lb/>
            something different from what the person intended who put the <lb/>
            question. He understood that A and B were coextensive. Whether <lb/>
            we call this reasoning or something else, makes no matter. A man <lb/>
            whose understanding is sound cannot in the nature of things reason <lb/>
            wrong; but his understanding of the matter on which he reasons may <lb/>
            bo wrong somewhere, and he may not be able to discover where. A <lb/>
            man who has been trained in the logical art may show him that his <lb/>
            conclusion is just according to his understanding of the terms and the <lb/>
            propositions employed, but yet it is not true. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            incapable of being cheated and deceived by false reasoning ? <lb/>
            And shall he enter into the contest, and yet not take care <lb/>
            whether he shall engage in argument not rashly and not <lb/>
            carelessly ? And if he does not take care, how can he be <lb/>
            such a man as we conceive him to be ? But without some <lb/>
            such exercise and preparation, can ho maintain a con­ <lb/>
            tinuous and consistent argument ? Let them show this; <lb/>
            and all these speculations (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρήματα</foreign>) become superfluous, <lb/>
            and are absurd and inconsistent with our notion of a good <lb/>
            and serious man.</p>
          <p>Why are we still indolent and negligent and sluggish, <lb/>
            and why do we seek pretences for not labouring and not <lb/>
            being watchful in cultivating our reason? If then I shall <lb/>
            make a mistake in these matters may I not have killed my <lb/>
            father ? Slave, where was there a father in this matter <lb/>
            that you could kill him ? What then have you done ? <lb/>
            The only fault that was possible hero is the fault which <lb/>
            you have committed. This is the very remark which I <lb/>
            made to Rufus 7 when he blamed me for not having dis­ <lb/>
            covered the one thing omitted in a certain syllogism: I <lb/>
            suppose, I said, that I have burnt the Capitol. Slave, he <lb/>
            replied, was the thing omitted here the Capitol ? Or arc <lb/>
            these the only crimes, to burn the Capitol and to kill your <lb/>
            father ? But for a man to use the appearances presented <lb/>
            to him rashly and foolishly and carelessly, and not to <lb/>
            understand argument, nor demonstration, nor sophism, <lb/>
            nor, in a word, to see in questioning and answering what <lb/>
            is consistent with that which we have granted or is not <lb/>
            consistent; is there no error in this ? <note type="footnote"> 7 Rufus is Musonius Rufus (i. 1). To kill a father and to burn <lb/>

          <p>IN as many ways as we can change things2 which are <lb/>
            equivalent to one another, in just so many ways we <lb/>
            can change the forms of arguments (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έπιχειρήματα</foreign>) and <lb/>
            enthymemes3 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ένθυμήματα</foreign>) in argumentation. This is an <lb/>
            instance: if you have borrowed and not repaid, you owe <lb/>
            me the money : you have not borrowed and you have not <lb/>
            repaid; then you do not owe me the money. To do this <lb/>
            skilfully is suitable to no man more than to the philo­ <lb/>
            sopher ; for if the enthymeme is an imperfect syllogism, <lb/>
            it is plain that he who has been exercised in the perfect <lb/>
            syllogism must be equally expert in the imperfect also.</p>
          <p>Why then do we not exorcise ourselves and one another <lb/>
            in this manner ? Because, I reply, at present, though we are <lb/>

            study of morality, by me at least, still we make no progress <lb/>

            this occupation ? and particularly as this would not only <lb/>
            be an occupation which would withdraw us from more <lb/>
            necessary things, but would also be a cause of self-conceit <lb/>
            and arrogance, and no small cause. For great is the <lb/>
            power of arguing and the faculty of persuasion, and par­ <lb/>

            additional ornament from language: and so universally, <lb/>

            they were burdens painful and intolerable, and to depart <lb/>
            to their kinsmen. But this is the labour that your <lb/>
            teacher and instructor ought to be employed upon, if he <lb/>
            really were what he should be. You should come to him <lb/>
            and say, " Epictetus, we can no longer endure being <lb/>
            bound to this poor body, and feeding it and giving it <lb/>
            drink, and rest, and cleaning it, and for the sake of the <lb/>
            body complying with the wishes of these and of those.6 <lb/>
            Are not these things indifferent and nothing to us; and <lb/>
            is not death no evil? And are we not in a manner <lb/>
            kinsmen of God, and did we not come from him ? Allow <lb/>
            us to depart to the place from which we came; allow us <lb/>
            to be released at last from these bonds by which we are <lb/>
            bound and weighed down. Here there are robbers and <lb/>
            thieves and courts of justice, and those who are named <lb/>
            tyrants, and think that they have some power over us by <lb/>
            means of the body and its possessions. Permit us to show <lb/>
            them that they have no power over any man." And I on <lb/>
            my part would say, Friends, wait for God: when He <lb/>
            shall give the signal and release you from this service, <lb/>
            then go to Him; but for the present endure to dwell in <lb/>
            this place where He has put you: short indeed is this <lb/>
            time of your dwelling here, and easy to bear for those <lb/>
            who are so disposed: for what tyrant or what thief, or <note type="footnote">5 The old man is Epictetus. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 He means, as Wolf says, " on account of the necessities of the <lb/>

            is that we must not depart from life without the command of God. <lb/>
            See Marcus Antoninus, ii. 17; iii. 5; v. 33. But how shall a man know <lb/>

            possessions of the body ? Wait then, do not depart <lb/>
            without a reason."</p>
          <p>Something like this ought to be said by the teacher to <lb/>
            ingenuous youths. But now what happens ? The teacher <lb/>
            is a lifeless body, and you are lifeless bodies. When you <lb/>
            have been well filled to-day, you sit down and lament <lb/>
            about the morrow, how you shall got something to eat. <lb/>
            Wretch, if you have it, you will have it; if you have it <lb/>
            not, you will depart from life. The door is open.8 Why <lb/>
            do you grieve? where does there remain any room for <lb/>
            tears ? and where is there occasion for flattery ? why shall <lb/>
            one man envy another? why should a man admire the <lb/>
            rich or the powerful, even if they be both very strong and <lb/>
            of violent temper? for what will they do to us? We shall <lb/>
            not care for that which they can do; and what we do <lb/>
            care for, that they cannot do. How did Socrates behave <lb/>
            with respect to these matters ? Why, in what other way <lb/>
            than a man ought to do who was convinced that he was <lb/>
            a kinsman of the gods? .. If you say to me now," said <lb/>
            Socrates to his judges,9 " we will acquit you on the con­ <lb/>

            you have hitherto discoursed, nor trouble either our young <lb/>

            maintain it, and to resolve to die a thousand times rather <lb/>
            than desert it; but if God has put us in any place and <lb/>

          <p>A man asked me to write to Rome about him, a man <lb/>
            who, as most people thought, had been unfortunate, for <lb/>
            formerly he was a man of rank and rich, but had been <lb/>
            stripped of all, and was living here. I wrote on his <lb/>
            behalf in a submissive manner; but when he had read the <lb/>
            letter, he gave it back to me and paid, "I wished for your <lb/>
            help, not your pity: no evil has happened to me."</p>
          <p>Thus also Musonius Rufus, in older to try me, used to <lb/>
            say: This and this will befall you from your master; <lb/>
            and when I replied that these were things which happen <lb/>
            in the ordinary course of human affairs. Why then, <lb/>
            said he, should I ask him for anything when I can <lb/>
            obtain it from you? For, in fact, what a man has from <lb/>
            himself, it is superfluous and foolish to receive from <lb/>
            another?10 Shall I then, who am able to receive from <lb/>
            myself greatness of soul and a generous spirit, receive <lb/>
            from you land and money or a magisterial office? I hope <lb/>
            not: I will not be so ignorant about my own possessions. <lb/>
            But when a man is cowardly and mean, what else must <lb/>
            be done for him than to write letters as you would about <lb/>
            a corpse.11 Please to grant us the body of a certain person <lb/>
            and a sextarius of poor blood. For such a person is, in <lb/>
            fact, a carcase and a sextarius (a certain quantity) of <lb/>
            blood, and nothing more. But if he were anything more, <lb/>
            he would know that one man is not miserable through the <lb/>
            means of another. <note type="footnote"> 10 Schweighaeuser has a long note on this passage, to "receive from <lb/>
            another." I think that there is no difficulty about the meaning; and <lb/>
            the careful reader will find none. Epictetus was once a slave. </note><note type="footnote"> 11 The meaning is obscure. Schweighaeuser thinks that the allu­ <lb/>
            sion is to a defeated enemy asking permission from the conqueror to <unclear/> <lb/>

            places his happiness in externals and in the favour of others. </note> <pb n="35"/>

            I am acquainted with a man older than myself, who is now <lb/>
            superintendent of corn at Rome, and I remember the time <lb/>
            when he came here on his way back from exile, and what <lb/>
            he said as he related the events of his former life, and <lb/>
            how he declared that with respect to the future after his <lb/>
            return he would look after nothing else than passing the <lb/>
            rest of his life in quiet and tranquillity. For how little of <lb/>
            life, he said, remains for me. 1 replied, you will not do it, <lb/>
            but as soon as you smell Rome, you will forget all thai you <lb/>
            have said; and if admission is allowed even into the im­ <lb/>
            perial palace, he2 will gladly thrust himself in and thank <lb/>
            God. If you find mo, Epictetus, ho answered, setting oven <lb/>
            one foot within the palace, think what you please. Well, <lb/>
            what then did he do ? Before he entered the city, he was <lb/>
            met by letters from Caesar, and as soon as he received them, <lb/>
            he forgot all, and ever after has added one piece of busi­ <lb/>
            ness to another. I wish that I were now by his side to <lb/>
            remind him of what lie said when he was passing this way, <lb/>
            and to tell him how much better a seer I am than he is.</p>

            what other persons do and what we do ? If you observe <lb/>
            what they do, you will understand. And what else do <lb/>
            they do all day long than make up accounts, enquire <lb/>
            among themselves, give and take advice about some <lb/>
            small quantity of grain, a bit of land, and such kind of <lb/>
            profits? Is it then the same thing to receive a petition <lb/>
            and to read in it: I intreat you to permit me to ex­ <lb/>
            port6 a small quantity of coin; and one to this effect: " I <lb/>
            intreat you to learn from Chrysippus what is the adminis­ <lb/>

            nature of your good and bad. Are these things like the <lb/>
            other, do they require equal care, and is it equally base to <lb/>
            neglect these and those? Well then are we the only per­ <lb/>

            he intends to say that We are active, but not in the way in which <lb/>

          <p>WHEN he was visited by one of the magistrates, Epictetus <lb/>
            inquired of him about several particulars, and asked if he <lb/>
            had children and a wife. The man replied that he had; <lb/>
            and Epictetus inquired further, how he felt under the <lb/>
            circumstances. Miserable, the man said. Then Epictetus <lb/>
            asked, In what respect, for men do not marry and beget <lb/>
            children in order to be wretched, but rather to be happy. <lb/>
            But I, the man replied, am so wretched about my children <lb/>
            that lately, when my little daughter was sick and was supposed to be in danger, I could not endure to stay with <lb/>
            her, but I left home till a person sent me news that she <lb/>
            had recovered. Well then, said Epictetus, do you think that <lb/>
            you acted right ? I acted naturally, the man replied. But <lb/>
            convince me of this that you acted naturally, and I will <lb/>
            convince you that everything which takes place according <lb/>
            to nature takes place rightly. This is the ease, said the <lb/>
            man, with all or at least most fathers. I do not deny that: <lb/>
            but the matter about which we are inquiring is whether <lb/>
            such behaviour is right; for in respect to this matter we <lb/>
            must say that tumours also come for the good of the body, <lb/>
            because they do come; and generally we must say that to <lb/>
            do wrong is natural, because nearly all or at least most of <lb/>
            us do wrong. Do you show me then how your behaviour <lb/>
            is natural. I cannot, he said ; but do you rather show me <lb/>
            how it is not according to nature, and is not rightly <lb/>
            done.</p>
          <p>Well, said Epictetus, if we were inquiring about white and <lb/>
            black, what criterion should we employ for distinguishing <lb/>
            between them ? The sight, he said. And if about hot and <lb/>
            cold, and haid and soft, what criterion ? The touch. Well <lb/>
            then, since we are inquiring about things which are according to nature, and those which are done rightly or not <lb/>
            rightly, what kind of criterion do you think that we should <lb/>
            employ? I do not know, he said, And yet not to know <lb/>
            the criterion of colours and smells, and also of tastes, is <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            perhaps no great harm; but, if a man do not know The <lb/>
            criterion of good and bad, and of things according to nature <lb/>
            and contrary to nature, does this seem to you a small harm ? <lb/>
            The greatest harm (I think). Come tell me, do all things <lb/>
            which seem to some persons to be good and becoming, <lb/>
            rightly appear such; and at present as to Jews and Syrians <lb/>
            and Egyptians and Romans, is it possible that the opinions <lb/>
            of all ot them in respect to food are right ? How is it <lb/>
            possible? he said. Well, I suppose, it is absolutely neces­ <lb/>
            saiy that, if the opinions of the Egyptians are right, the <lb/>
            opinions of the rest must he wrong: if the opinions of tho <lb/>
            Jews are right, those of the rest cannot be right. Cer­ <lb/>
            tainly. But where there is ignorance, there also there is <lb/>
            want of learning and training in things which are necessary. He assented to this. You then, said Epictetus, <lb/>
            since you know this, for the future will employ yourself <lb/>
            seriously about nothing else, and will apply your mind to <lb/>
            nothing else than to learn the criterion of things which are <lb/>
            according to nature, and by using it also to determine each <lb/>
            several thing. But in the present matter I have so much <lb/>
            as this to aid you towards what you wish. Does affection <lb/>
            to those of your family appear to you to be according to <lb/>
            nature and to bo good? Certainly. Well, is such affection <lb/>
            natural and good, and is a thing consistent with reason not <lb/>
            good? By no means. Is then that which is consistent with <lb/>
            reason in contradiction with affection? I think not. You <lb/>
            are right, for if it is otherwise, it is necessary that one of <lb/>
            the contradictions being according tonatuie, the other must <lb/>
            be contrary to nature. Is it not so ? It is, he said. Whatever <lb/>
            then we shall discover to be at the same time affectionate <lb/>
            and also consistent with reason, this we confidently declare <lb/>
            to be right and good. Agiced. Well then to leave your <lb/>
            sick child and to go away is not reasonable, and I suppose <lb/>
            that you will not say that it is; but it remains for us to <lb/>
            inquire if it is consistent with affection. Yes, let us consider. Did you then, since you had an affectionate disposition to your child, do right when you ran off and left her; <lb/>
            and has the mother no affection for the child? Certainly, <lb/>
            she has. Ought then the mother also to have left her, or <lb/>
            ought she not ? She ought not. And the nurse, does she <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            love her? She does. Ought then she also to have left her? <lb/>
            By no means. And the paodagogue,1 does he not love her? <lb/>
            He does love her. Ought then he also to have deserted <lb/>
            her? and so should iho child have been left alone and <lb/>
            without help on account of the great affection of you the <lb/>
            parents and of those about her, or should she have died in <lb/>
            the hands of those who neither loved her nor cared for her? <lb/>
            Certainly not. Now this is unfair and unreasonable, not <lb/>
            to allow those who have equal affection with yourself to do <lb/>
            what you think to be proper for yourself to do because you <lb/>
            have affection. It is absurd. Come then, if you were <lb/>
            sick, would you wish your relations to be so affectionate, <lb/>
            and all the rest, children and wife, as to leave you alone <lb/>
            and deserted? By no means. And would you wish to be <lb/>
            so loved by your own that through their excessive affection <lb/>
            you would always be left alone in sickness? or for this <lb/>
            reason would you rather pray, if it were possible, to be <lb/>
            loved by your enemies and deserted by them ? But if this <lb/>
            is so, it results that your behaviour was not at all an affectionate act.</p>
          <p>Well then, was it nothing which moved yon and induced <lb/>
            you to desert your child ? and how is that possible ? But <lb/>
            it might be something of the kind which moved a man at <lb/>
            Home to wrap up his head while a horse was running <lb/>
            which he favoured ; and when contrary to expectation the <lb/>
            horse won, he required sponges to recover from his fainting fit. What then is the thing which moved? The <lb/>
            exact discussion of this does not belong to the present <lb/>
            occasion perhaps; but it is enough to be convinced of <lb/>
            this, if what the philosophers say is true, that we must <lb/>
            not look for it anywhere without, but in all cases it is one <lb/>
            and the same thing which is the cause of our doing or not <lb/>
            doing something, of saying or not saying something, of <lb/>
            being elated or depressed, of avoiding any thing or pur <lb/>
            suing: the very thing which is now the cause to me and <lb/>
            to you, to you of coming to me and sitting and hearing, <lb/>
            and to me of saying what I do say. And what is this ? <lb/>
            Is it any other than our will to do sc ? No other. But <note type="footnote"> ' "When we are children our parents put us in the hands of a <lb/>

            if we had willed otherwise, what else should we have <lb/>
            been doing than that which we willed to do ? This then <lb/>
            was the cause of Achilles' lamentation, not the death of <lb/>

            do so. And to you this was the very cause of your then <lb/>

            you will not go thither. And in a word, neither death <lb/>
            nor exile nor pain nor anything of the kind is the cause <lb/>
            of our doing anything or not doing; but our own opinions <lb/>

          <p>WITH respect to gods, there are some who say that a <lb/>
            divine being does not exist: others say that it exists, but <lb/>
            is inactive and careless, and takes no forethought about <lb/>
            any thing ; a third class say that such a being exists and <lb/>
            exercises forethought, but only about great things and <lb/>
            heavenly things, and about nothing on the earth; a fourth <lb/>
            class say that a divine being exercises forethought both <lb/>
            about things on the earth and heavenly things, but in a <lb/>
            general way only, and not about things severally. There <lb/>
            is a fifth class to whom Ulysses and Socrates belong, who <lb/>
            say: "I move not without thy knowledge"1 (Iliad, x. <lb/>
            278). <note type="footnote"> 3 He uses the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγματα</foreign>, which contains the samo element or <lb/>
            root as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοκεῖ, ἔδοξε</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 A Scholasticus is one who frequents the schools; a studious and <lb/>
            literary person, who does not engage in the business of active life. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The liue is from tho prayer of Ulysses to Athena: " Hear me <lb/>
            child of Zeus, thou who standest by me always in all dangers, nor do <lb/>
            I even move without thy knowledge.” Socrates said that the gods <lb/>
            know everything, what is said and done and thought (Xenophon. <lb/>
            Mem. i. 1, 19). Compare Cicero, Do Nat. Deorum, i. 1, 2; and Dr. <lb/>
            Price's Dissertation on Providence, sect. i. Epictetus enumerates the <lb/>
            various opinions about the gods in antient times. The <unclear>roder</unclear> may <lb/>
            consult the notes in Schweighaeuser's edition. The opinions about <lb/>
            God among modern nations, who are called civilized, and are so more <lb/>
            or less, do not seem to be so varied as in antient times ; but the contrasts in modern opinions are striking. These modern opinions vary <lb/>
            between denial of a God, though the number of those who deny is <lb/>
            perhaps not large, and the superstitious notions about God and his <lb/>
            administration of the world, which are taught by teachers, learned <lb/>
            and ignorant, and exercise a great power over the minds of those who <lb/>
            are unable or do not dare to exercise the faculty of reason. </note> <pb n="42"/>
            </p>
          <p>Before all other things then it is necessary to inquire <lb/>
            about each of these opinions, whether it is affirmed truly <lb/>
            or not truly. For if there are no gods, how is it our <lb/>
            proper end to follow them?2 And if they exist, but take <lb/>
            no care of anything, in this case also how will it be right <lb/>
            to follow them? But if indeed they do exist and look <lb/>
            after things, still if there is nothing communicated from <lb/>
            them to men, nor in fact to myself, how even so is it right <lb/>
            (to follow them) ? The wise and good man then after con­ <lb/>
            sidering all these things, submits his own mind to him <lb/>
            who administers the whole, as good citizens do to the law <lb/>
            of the state. He who is receiving instruction ought to <lb/>
            come to be instructed with this intention, How shall I <lb/>
            follow the gods in all things, how shall I be contented <lb/>
            with the divine administration, and how can I become <lb/>
            free? For be is free to whom every thing happens <lb/>
            according to his will, and whom no man can hinder. <lb/>
            What then is freedom madness? Certainly not: for mad­ <lb/>
            ness ;n I freedom do not consist. But, you say, I would <lb/>
            have every thing result just as I like, and in whatever <lb/>
            way I like. You are mad, you are beside yourself. Do <lb/>
            you not know that freedom is a noble and valuable thing? <lb/>
            But for me inconsiderately to wish for things to happen <lb/>
            as I inconsiderately like, this appears to be not only not <lb/>
            noble, but even most base. For how do we proceed in <lb/>
            the matter of writing ? Do I wish to write the name of <lb/>
            Dion as I choose ? No, but I am taught to choose to write <lb/>
            it as it ought to be written. And how with respect to <lb/>
            music ? In the same manner. And what universally in <lb/>
            every art or science? Just the same. If it were not so, <lb/>
            it would be of no value to know anything, if knowledge <lb/>
            were adapted to every man's whim. Is it then in this <lb/>
            alone, in this which is the greatest and the chief thing, <lb/>
            I mean freedom, that I aID permitted to will inconsiderately ? By no means; but to be instructed is this, to <lb/>
            learn to wish that every thing may happen as it does.3 <note type="footnote"> 2 “To follow God," is a Stoical expression. Antoninus, x. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This means that we ought to learn to he satisfied with everything <lb/>
            that happens, in fact with the will of God. This is a part of education, according to Epictetus. But it does not appear in our systems of <lb/>
            education so plainly as it does here. Antoninus (iv. 23): “ Everything <lb/>
            harmonizes with me, which is harmonious to thee, 0 universe. Nothing <lb/>
            for me is too early nor too late, which is in due time for thee," </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            And how do things happen? As the disposer has dis­ <lb/>
            posed them ? And he has appointed summer and winter, <lb/>
            and abundance and scarcity, and virtue and vice, and all <lb/>
            finch opposites for the harmony of the whole;4 and to <lb/>
            each of us he has given a body, and paits of the body, <lb/>
            and possessions, and companions.</p>
          <p>remembering then this disposition of things, we ought <lb/>
            to go to be instructed, not that we may change the consti­ <lb/>
            tution 5 of things,—for we have not the power to do it, <lb/>
            nor is it better that we should have the power,-but in <lb/>
            order that, as the things around us are what they are and <lb/>
            by nature exist, we may maintain our minds in harmony <lb/>
            with the things which happen. For can we escape from <lb/>
            men ? and how is it possible ? And if we associate with <lb/>
            them, can we change them ? Who gives us the power ? <lb/>
            What then lemains, or what method is discovered of holding commerce with them? Is there such a method by <lb/>
            which they shall do what seems fit to them, and we not <lb/>
            the less shall be in a mood which is conformable to nature ? <lb/>
            But you are unwilling to endure and are discontented: <lb/>
            and if you are alone, you call it solitude; and if you are <lb/>
            with men, you call them knaves and robbers; and you <lb/>
            find fault with your own parents and children, and brothers <lb/>
            and neighbours. But you ought when you are alone to <lb/>
            call this condition by the name of tranquillity and freedom, <note type="footnote"> 4 Upton has collected the passages in which this doctrine was men­ <lb/>
            tioned. One passage is in Gollius (vi. 1), from the fourth book of <lb/>
            Chrysippus on Providence, who says : " nothing is more foolish than <lb/>
            the opinions of those who think that good could have existed without <lb/>
            evil." Schweighneuser wishes that Epictetus had discussed more fully <lb/>
            the question on the nature and origin of Evil. He refers to the cola. <lb/>
            mentary of Simplicius on tho Ellcheiridion of Epictetus, c. 13 (8), and <lb/>
            34 (27), for his treatment of this subject. Epictetus (Encheiridion, <lb/>
            c. 27) says that " as a mark is not set up for the purpose of missing it, <lb/>
            bo neither does the nature of evil exist in the universe." Simplicius <lb/>
            observes (p. 278, ed. Schweig.): “ The Good is that which is according to each thing's nature, wherein each thing has its perfection: but <lb/>
            the Bad is the disposition contrary to its nature of the thing which <lb/>
            contains the bAd, by which disposition it is deprived of that which is <lb/>
            according to nature, namely, the good. For if the Bad as well as the <lb/>
            Good were a disposition and perfection of the form (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδους</foreign>) in which it <lb/>
            is, the bad itself would also be good and would not then be called <lb/>
            Bad.” </note><note type="footnote"> 5 The word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐποθέσεις</foreign>. It is explained by what follows. </note> <lb/>

            and to think yourself like to the gods; and when you are <lb/>
            with many, you ought not to call it crowd, nor trouble, <lb/>
            nor uneasiness, but festival and assembly, and so accept <lb/>
            all contentedly.</p>
          <p>What then is the punishment of those who do not <lb/>
            accept ? It is to be what they are. Is any person dissatisfied with being alone ? let him be alone. Is a man <lb/>
            dissatisfied with his parents ? let him be a bad son, and <lb/>
            lament. Is he dissatisfiod with his children? let him <lb/>
            be a bad father. Cast him into prison. What prison? <lb/>
            Where he is already, for he is there against his will; and <lb/>
            where a man is against his will, there he is in prison. So <lb/>
            Socrates was not in prison, for he was there willingly- <lb/>
            Must my leg then be lamed? Wietch, do you then on <lb/>
            account of one poor leg find fault with the world? Will <lb/>
            you not willingly surrender it for the whole? Will you <lb/>
            not withdraw from it ? Will you not gladly part with it <lb/>
            to him who gave it ? And will you be vexed and discontented with the things established by Zeus, which he with <lb/>
            the Moirae (fates) who were present and spinning the <lb/>
            thread of your generation, defined and put in order? <lb/>
            Know you not how small apart you are compared with the <lb/>
            whole.6 I mean with respect to the body, for as to intelligence you are not inferior to the gods nor less; for the <lb/>
            magnitude of intelligence is not measured by length nor <lb/>
            yet by height, but by thoughts.7</p>

            such a man at this moment unite with such a woman that <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WHEN some one asked, how may a man eat acceptably to <lb/>
            the gods, he answered : If he can eat justly and contentedly, <lb/>
            and with equanimity, and temperately and orderly, will it <lb/>
            not be also acceptably to the gods? But when you have <lb/>
            asked for warm water and the save has not heard, or if be <lb/>
            did hear has brought only tepid water, or he is not even <lb/>
            found to be in the house, then not to be vexed or to burst <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            with passion, is not this acceptable to the gods?—How <lb/>
            then shall a man endure such persons as this slave ? <lb/>
            Slave yourself, will you not bear with your own brother, <lb/>
            who has Zeus for his progenitor, and is like a son from <lb/>
            the same seeds and of the same descent from above ? lint <lb/>
            if you have been put in any such higher place, will yon <lb/>
            immediately make yourself a tyrant? Will you not <lb/>
            remember who you are, and whom you rule? that they are <lb/>
            kinsmen, that they are brethren by nature, that they are <lb/>
            the offspring of Zeus? 1—But I have purchased them, and <lb/>
            they have not purchased me. Do you see in what direction <lb/>
            you are looking, that it is towards the earth, towards the <lb/>
            pit, that it is towards these wretched laws of dead men ? a <lb/>
            but towards the laws of the gods you are not looking.</p>

            Ep. 95). “ The universe is either a confusion, a mutual involution of <lb/>
            things and a dispersion; or it is unity and order and providence" <lb/>
            (Antoninus, vi. 10) : also vii. 9, " all things are implicated with one <lb/>
            another, and the bond is holy ; and there is hardly any thing unconnected with any other thing." See also Cicero, Do Nat. Deorum, ii. <lb/>

            that earthly things have a natural agreement and union 2 <lb/>
            with heavenly things ? I do. And how else so regularly <lb/>
            as if by God's command, when IIe bids the plants to flower, <lb/>
            do they flower ? when Ho bids them to send forth shoots, <lb/>
            do they shoot? when IIe bids them to produce fruit, how <lb/>
            else do they produce fruit ? when He bids the fruit to ripen, <lb/>
            does it ripen? when again He bids them to cast down the <lb/>
            fruits, how else do they cast them down ? and when to <lb/>
            shed the leaves, do they shed the leaves ? and when He <lb/>
            bids them to fold themselves up and to remain quiet and <lb/>
            rest, how else do they remain quiet and rest? And how <lb/>
            else at the growth and the wane of the moon, and at the <lb/>
            approach and recession of the sun, are so great an altera­ <lb/>

            But are plants and our bodie&lt; so bound up and united with <lb/>
            the whole, and are not our souls much more ? and our souls <lb/>
            so bound up and in contact with God as parts of Him and <lb/>
            portions of Ilim; and does not God perceive every motion <lb/>
            of these parts as being his own motion connate with himself? <lb/>
            Now are you able to think of the divine administration, <lb/>
            and about all things divine, and at the same time also <lb/>
            about human affairs, and to be moved by ten thousand <lb/>
            things at the same time in your senses and in your understanding, and to assent to some, and to dissent from others, <lb/>
            and again as to some things to suspend your judgment; <lb/>
            and do you retain in your soul so many impressions from <lb/>
            so many and various things, and being moved by them, do <lb/>
            you fall upon notions similar to those first impressed, and <lb/>
            do you retain numerous arts and the memories of ten <lb/>

            things at once. But who tells you that you have equal <lb/>
            power with Zeus? Nevertheless he has placed by every <lb/>
            man a guardian, every man's Daemon,4 to whom he has <lb/>
            committed the care of the man, a guardian who never <lb/>
            sleeps, is never deceived. For to what better and more <lb/>
            careful guardian could He have intrusted each of us?5 <lb/>
            When then you have shut the doors and made darkness <lb/>
            within, remember never to say that you are alone, for you <lb/>
            are not; but God is within, and your Daemon is within, <lb/>
            and what need have they of light to see what you are <lb/>
            doing ? To this God you ought to swear an oath just as <lb/>
            the soldiers do to Caesar. But they who are hired for pay <lb/>
            swear to regard the safety of Caesar before all things; and <lb/>
            you who have received so many and such great favours, <lb/>
            will you not swear, or when you have sworn, will you not <lb/>
            abide by your oath? And what shall you swear? Never <lb/>
            to be disobedient, never to make any charges, never to <lb/>
            find fault with any thing that he has given, and never <lb/>
            unwillingly to do or to suffer any thing that is necessary. <lb/>
            Is this oath like the soldier's oath? The soldiers swear <lb/>
            not to prefer any man to Caesar : in this oath men swear to <lb/>
            honour themselves before all.6 <note type="footnote"> 4 Antoninus, v. 27: " Live with the gods. And lie docs live with <lb/>
            the gods who constantly shows to them that his own soul is satisfied <lb/>

            <title type="sub">WHAT PHILOSOPHY PROMISES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>When a man was consulting him how he should persuade <lb/>
            his brother to cease being angry with him, Epictetus <lb/>
            replied, Philosophy does not propose to secure for a man <lb/>
            any external thing. If it did (or, if it were not, as I say), <lb/>
            philosophy would be allowing something which is not <lb/>
            within its province. For as the carpenter's material is <lb/>
            wood, and that of the statuary is copper, so the matter of <lb/>
            the art of living is each man's life,-What then is my <lb/>
            brother's ?—That again belongs to his own art; but with <lb/>
            respect to yours, it is one of the external things, like a <lb/>
            piece of land, like health, like reputation. But Philosophy <lb/>
            promises none of these. In every circumstance I will main­ <lb/>
            tain, she says, the governing part conformable to nature. <lb/>
            Whose governing part ? His in whom I am, she says.</p>
          <p>How then shall my brother cease to be angry with <lb/>
            me? Bring him to me and I will tell him. But I have <lb/>
            nothing to say to you about his anger.</p>
          <p>When the man, who was consulting him, said, I seek <lb/>
            to know this, How, even if my brother is not reconciled <lb/>
            to me, shall I maintain myself in a state conformable to <lb/>
            nature ? Nothing great, said Epictetus, is produced suddenly, since not even the grape or the fig is. If you say <lb/>
            to me now that you want a fig, I will answer to you that <lb/>
            it requires time : let it flower 2 first, then put forth fruit,. <lb/>
            and then ripen. Is then the fruit of a fig-tree not perfected <lb/>
            suddenly and in one hour, and would you possess the fruit <lb/>
            of a man's mind in so short a time and so easily ? Do not <lb/>
            expect it, even if I tell you. <note type="footnote"> 1 This is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἠγεμονικόν</foreign>, a word often used by Antoninus, ii. 2 ; vi. 8. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 "The philosopher had forgot that fig-trees do not blossom" (Mrs. <lb/>

            understand his pointing, nor his version. Wolf translates it, “ Etst <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF PROVIDENCE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Do not wonder if for other animals than man all things <lb/>
            are provided for the body, not only food and drink, but beds <lb/>
            also, and they have no need of shoes nor bed materials, <lb/>
            nor clothing; but we require all these additional things. <lb/>
            For animals not being made for themselves, but for service, <lb/>
            it was not fit for them to be made so as to need other <lb/>
            things. For consider what it would be for us to take care <lb/>
            not only of ourselves, but also about cattle and asses, how <lb/>
            they should be clothed, and how shod, and how they <lb/>
            should eat and drink. Now as soldiers are ready for their <lb/>
            commander, shod, clothed, and armed: but it would be <lb/>
            -a hard thing for the chiliarch (tribune) to go round and <lb/>
            shoe or clothe his thousand men: so also nature has formed <lb/>
            the animals which are made for service, all ready, pre­ <lb/>
            pared, and requiring no further care. So one little boy <lb/>
            with only a stick drives the cattle.</p>
          <p>But now we, instead of being thankful that we need <lb/>
            not take the same care of animals as of ourselves, complain <lb/>
            of God on our own account; and yet, in the name of Zeus <lb/>
            and the gods, any one thing of those which exist would <lb/>
            be enough to make a man perceive the providence of God, <lb/>
            at least a man who is modest and grateful. And speak <lb/>
            not to me now of the great things, but only of this, that <lb/>
            milk is produced from grass, and cheese from milk, and <lb/>
            wool from skins. Who made these things or devised <lb/>
            them? No one, you say. 0 amazing shamelessness and <lb/>
            stupidity!</p>
          <p>Well, let us omit the works of nature, and contemplate <lb/>
            her smaller (subordinate, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρεργα</foreign>) acts. Is there anything <lb/>
            less useful than the hair on the chin? What then, has <lb/>
            not nature used this hair also in the most suitable manner <lb/>
            possible? Has she not by it distinguished the male and <lb/>
            the female? does not the nature of every man forthwith <lb/>
            proclaim from a distance, I am a man: as such approach <lb/>
            me, as such speak to me; look for nothing else; see the <lb/>
            signs ? Again, in the case of women, as she has mingled <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            something softer in the voice, so she has also deprived them <lb/>
            of hair (on the chin). You say, not so: the human animal <lb/>
            ought to have been left without marks of distinction, and <lb/>
            each of us should have been obliged to proclaim, I am a <lb/>
            man. But how is not the sign beautiful and becoming <lb/>
            and venerable? how much more beautiful than the cock's <lb/>
            comb, how much more becoming than the lion's mane? <lb/>
            For this reason we ought to preserve the signs which God <lb/>
            has given, we ought not to throw them away, nor to confound, as much as we can, the distinctions of the sexes.</p>
          <p>Are these the only works of providence in us? And <lb/>
            what words are sufficient to praise them and set them forth <lb/>
            according to their worth? For if we had understanding, <lb/>
            ought we to do any thing else both jointly and severally <lb/>
            than to sing hymns and bless the deity, and to tell of <lb/>
            his benefits?1 Ought we not when we are digging and <lb/>
            ploughing and eating to sing this hymn to God? "Great <lb/>
            is God, who has given us such implements with which we <lb/>
            shall cultivate the earth: great is God who has given us <lb/>
            hands, the power of swallowing, a stomach, imperceptible <lb/>
            growth, and the power of breathing while we sleep." This <lb/>
            is what we ought to sing on every occasion, and to sing the <lb/>
            greatest and most divine hymn for giving us the faculty <lb/>
            of comprehending these things and using a proper way.2 <lb/>
            Well then, since most of you have become blind, ought there <lb/>
            not to be some man to fill this office, and on behalf of all to <lb/>
            sing3 the hymn to God? For what else can I do, a lame <lb/>
            old man, than sing hymns to God ? If then I was a night­ <lb/>
            ingale, I would do the part of a nightingale. if I were <lb/>
            a swan, I would do like a swan. But now I am a rational <lb/>
            creature, and I ought to praise God: this is my work; I <lb/>
            do it, nor will I desert this post, so long as I am allowed <lb/>
            to keep it; and I exhort you to join in this same song. <note type="footnote"> 1 Antoninus, v. 33. </note><note type="footnote"> ' See Upton's note on <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁδῷ</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾄδοντα</foreign> is Sohweighaeuscr's probable emendation. </note> <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <pb n="52"/>

            <title type="sub">THAT THE LOGICAL ART IS NECESSARY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>SINCE reason is the faculty which analyses 1 and perfects <lb/>
            the rest, and it ought itself not to be unanalysed, by what <lb/>
            should it be analysed ? for it is plain that this should be <lb/>
            done either by itself or by another thing. Either then <lb/>
            this other thing also is reason, or something else superior <lb/>
            to reason; which'is impossible. But if it is reason, again <lb/>
            who shall analyse that reason ? For if that reason does <lb/>
            this for itself, our reason also can do it. But if we shall <lb/>
            require something else, the thing will go on to infinity and <lb/>
            have no end.2 Reason therefore is analysed by itself. <lb/>
            Yes : but it is more urgent to cure (our opinions 3) and the <lb/>
            like. Will you then hear about those things ? Hear. But <lb/>
            if you should say, " I know not whether you are arguing <lb/>
            truly or falsely," and if I should express myself in any way <lb/>
            ambiguously, and you should say to me, " Distinguish," <lb/>
            I will bear with you no longer, and I shall say to you, " It <lb/>
            is more urgent." 4 This is the reason, I suppose, why they <lb/>
            (the Stoic teachers) place the logical art first, as in the <lb/>
            measuring of corn we place first the examination of the <lb/>
            measure. But if we do not determine first what is a <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λὁγο</foreign>s <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϭτἰν ὁ διαρθρῶν. Διαρθροῦν</foreign> means "to divide a thing <lb/>
            into its parts or members." The word "analyse" seems to be the <lb/>
            nearest equivalent. See Schweig.'s note on <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὀ τἰνο</foreign>s <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ϭιαρθρωθῆ̣</foreign>; </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is obscure. The conclusion, " Reason therefore is analysed <lb/>
            by itself" is not in Epictetus; but it is implied, as Schweighaeuser <lb/>
            says (p. 197, notes). So Antoninus, xi. 1, writes: "These are the <lb/>
            properties of the rational soul; it sees itself, analyses itself." If <lb/>

          <p>In this case then if we have not fully learned and <lb/>

            a thing which produces no fruit,-But it is a thing which <lb/>
            can measure corn.-Logic also produces no fruit.-As to <lb/>
            this indeed we shall see : but then even if a man should <lb/>
            grant this, it is enough that logic has the power of distin­ <lb/>
            guishing and examining other things, and, as we may <lb/>
            say, of measuring and weighing them. Who says this ? <lb/>
            Is it only Chrysippus, and Zeno, and Cleanthes? And <lb/>
            does not Antisthenes say so?5 And who is it that has <lb/>
            written that the examination of names is the beginning of <lb/>
            education ? And does not Socrates say so ? And of whom <lb/>
            does Xenophon write, that he began with the examination <lb/>
            of names, what each name signified ?6 Is this then the <lb/>
            great and wondrous thing to understand or interpret Chrysippus? Who says this ?-What then is the wondrous <lb/>
            thing ?-To understand the will of nature. Well then do <lb/>
            you apprehend it yourself by your own power ? and what <lb/>
            more have you need of ? For if it is true that all men <lb/>
            err involuntarily, and you have learned the truth, of necessity you must act right.-But in truth I do not apprehend <lb/>
            the will of nature. Who then tells us what it is ?—They <lb/>
            say that it is Chrysippus.—I proceed, and I inquire what <lb/>
            this interpreter of nature says. I begin not to understand <lb/>
            what he says: I seek an interpreter of Chrysippus.—Well, <lb/>
            consider how this is said, just as if it were said in the <note type="footnote"> 5 Antisthenes, who professed the Cynic philosophy, rejected Logic <lb/>
            and Physic (Schweig. note p. 201). </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Xenophon, Mem. iv. 5, 12, and iv. 6, 7. Epictetus knew what <lb/>

            Roman tongue.7—What then is this superciliousness of <lb/>
            the interpreter?8 There is no superciliousness which can <lb/>
            justly be charged even to Chrysippus, if he only interprets <lb/>
            the will of nature, but does not follow it himself; and <lb/>
            much more is this so with his interpreter. For we have <lb/>
            no need of Chrysippus for his own sake, but in order that <lb/>
            we may understand nature. Nor do we need a diviner <lb/>
            (sacrificer) on his own account, but because we think that <lb/>
            through him we shall know the future and understand the <lb/>
            signs given by the gods; nor do we need the viscera of <lb/>
            animals for their own sake, but because through them <lb/>
            signs are given; nor do wo look with wonder on the crow <lb/>
            or raven, but on God, who through them gives signs ?9</p>
          <p>I go then to the interpreter of these things and the <lb/>
            sacrificer, and I say, Inspect the viscera for me, and tell me <lb/>
            what signs they give. The man takes the viscera, opens <lb/>
            them, and interprets: Man, he says, you have a will free <lb/>
            by nature from hindrance and compulsion ; this is written <lb/>
            here in the viscera. I will show you this first in the matter <lb/>
            of assent. Can any man hinder you from assenting to the <lb/>
            truth? No man can. Can any man compel you to receive <lb/>
            what is false? No man can. You see that in this matter <lb/>
            you have the faculty of the will free from hindrance, free <lb/>
            from compulsion, unimpeded. Well then, in the matter of <lb/>
            desire and pursuit of an object, is it otherwise ? And what <lb/>
            can overcome pursuit except another pursuit ? And what <lb/>
            can overcome desire and aversion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔκκλιϭιν</foreign>) except another <lb/>
            desire and aversion ? But, you object: " If you place before <lb/>
            me the fear of death, you do compel me." No, it is not what <lb/>
            is placed before you that compels, but your opinion that it <lb/>
            is better to do so and so than to die. In this matter then <lb/>
            it is your opinion that compelled you : that is, will compelled will.10 For if God had made that part of himself, <note type="footnote"> 7 The supposed interpreter says this. When Epictetus says " the <lb/>

          <p>IF what philosophers say is true, that all men have one principle, as in the case of assent the persuasion1 that a thing <lb/>
            is so, and in the case of dissent the persuasion that a <lb/>
            thing is not so, and in the case of a suspense of judgment <lb/>

            he may make resistance to him who attempts to enforce the threat; <lb/>
            or he may refuse to yield, and so take the consequence of his refusal. <lb/>
            If a man yields to the threat, he does so for the reason which Epictotus gives, and freedom of choice, and consequently freedom of will <lb/>
            really exists in this case. The Roman law did not allow contracts or <lb/>
            agreements made under the iniluenco of threats to be valid; and the <lb/>
            reason for declaring them invalid was not the want of free will in him <lb/>
            who yielded to the threat, but the fact that threats are directly contrary to the purpose of all law, which purpose is to secure the independent action of every person in all things allowed by law. This <lb/>
            matter is discussed by Savigny, Das heut. Römische Recht, iii. § 114. <lb/>

            and reward, all blame of ourselves or others, all sense of misbehaviour <lb/>

            more. It is also true that persons, who are not ignorant, often do what <lb/>
            they know to be evil, and even what they would condemn in another, <lb/>
            at least before they had fallen into the same evil themselves; for <lb/>
            when they have done what they know to bo wrong, they have a fellow- <lb/>
            feeling with others who are as bad as themselves. Nor does he say, <lb/>
            as Mrs. Carter seems to imply that he docs, for her words are ambiguous, that they who voluntarily suffer their inclinations to blind <lb/>
            their judgment are justified by following them. He says that men <lb/>
            will do as they do, so long as they think as they think. He only <lb/>
            traces to their origin the bad acts which bad men do; and he says <lb/>
            that we should pity them and try to mend them. Now the best man <lb/>
            in the world, if lie sees the origin and direct cause of bad acts in men, <lb/>
            may pity them for their wickedness, and he will do right. He will <lb/>
            pity, and still he will punish severely, if the interests of society <lb/>
            require the guilty to be punished: but he will not punish in anger. <lb/>
            Epictetus says nothing about legal penalties; and I assume that he <lb/>
            would not say that the penalties are always unjust, if I understand his <lb/>
            principles. His discourse is to this effect, as the title tells us, that we <lb/>
            ought not to be angry with the errors of others: the matter of the <lb/>
            discourse is the feeling and disposition which we ought to have towards <lb/>
            those who do wrong, "because they are mistaken about good and <lb/>

            Well, suppose you put a young girl in his way, what <lb/>
            then? and what, if it is in the dark?8 what if it should <lb/>
            be a little reputation, or abuse ; and what, if it should be <lb/>
            praise; and what if it should be death? He is able to <lb/>
            overcome all. What then if it be in heat, and what if it <lb/>
            is in the rain,9 and what if he be in a melancholy (mad) <lb/>

            obstinate. The meaning then is, as Schweighaeuser says: "a man <lb/>
            should be invincible, not with a kind of stupid obstinacy or laziness <lb/>
            and slowness in moving himself like an ass, but he should be invincible through reason, reflection, meditation, study, and diligence." </note><note type="footnote"> 8 " From the rustics came the old proverb, for when they commend <lb/>

            <title type="sub">HOW WE SHOULD BEHAVE TO TYRANTS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IF a man possesses any superiority, or thinks that he does, <lb/>
            when he does not, such a man, if he is uninstructed, will <lb/>
            of necessity be puffed up through it. For instance, the <lb/>
            tyrant says, " I am master of all ? " And what can you <lb/>
            do for me ? Can you give me desire which shall have no <lb/>
            hindrance? How can you? Have you the infallible <lb/>
            power of avoiding what you would avoid ? Have you the <lb/>
            power of moving towards an object without error ? And <lb/>
            how do you possess this power ? Come, when you are in <lb/>
            a ship, do you trust to yourself or to the helmsman ? And <lb/>
            when you arc in a chariot, to whom do you trust but to <lb/>
            the driver? And how is it in all other arts? Just the <lb/>
            same. In what then lies your power? All men pay <lb/>
            respect1 to me. Well, I also pay respect to my platter, <lb/>
            and I wash it and wipe it; and for the sake of my oil <lb/>
            flask, I drive a peg into the wall. Well then, are these <lb/>
            things superior to me ? No, but they supply some of my <lb/>
            wants, and for this reason I take care of them. Well, do <lb/>
            I not attend to my ass ? Do I not wash his feet ? Do I <lb/>
            not clean him ? Do you not know that every man has <lb/>
            regard to himself, and to you just the same as he has <lb/>
            regard to his ass ? For who has regard to you as a man ? <lb/>
            Show me. Who wishes to become like you? Who <lb/>
            imitates you, as he imitates Socrates?—But I can cut off <lb/>
            your head.—You say right. I had forgotten that I must <lb/>
            have regard to you, as I would to a fever2 and the bile, <lb/>
            and raise an altar to you, as there is at Rome an altar <lb/>
            to fever.</p>
          <p>What is it then that disturbs and terrifies the multi­ <lb/>
            tude ? is it the tyrant and his guards ? [By no means.] <lb/>
            I hope that it is not so. It is not possible that what <lb/>
            is by nature free can be disturbed by anything else, or <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεραπεύουσι</foreign>.

            hindered by any other thing than by itself. But it is a <lb/>
            man's own opinions which disturb him : for when the <lb/>
            tyrant says to a man, " I will chain your leg," he who <lb/>
            values his leg says, " Do not; have pity:" but ho who <lb/>
            values his own will says, " If it appears more advantageous <lb/>
            to you, chain it." Do you not care? I do not care. I <lb/>
            will show you that I am master. You cannot do that. <lb/>
            Zeus has set me free : do you think that lie intended to <lb/>
            allow his own son to be enslaved? But you are master <lb/>
            of my carcase : take it.-So when you approach me, you <lb/>
            have no regard to me ? No, but I have regard to myself; <lb/>
            and if you wish me to say that I have regard to you also, <lb/>
            I tell you that I have the same regard to you that I have <lb/>
            to my pipkin.</p>
          <p>This is not a perverse self-regard,4 for the animal is <lb/>
            constituted so as to do all things for itself. For even the <lb/>
            sun does all things for itself; nay, even Zeus himself. <lb/>
            But when he chooses to be the Giver of rain and the Giver <lb/>
            of fruits, and the Father of Gods and men, you see that <lb/>
            he cannot obtain these functions and these names, if he is <lb/>
            not useful to man; and, universally, he has made the <lb/>
            nature of the rational animal such that it cannot obtain <lb/>
            any one of its own proper interests, if it does not con­ <lb/>
            tribute something to the common interest.5 In this <lb/>
            manner and sense it is not unsociable for a man to do <lb/>
            every thing for the sake of himself. For what do you <lb/>
            expect? that a man should neglect himself and his own <lb/>
            interest? And how in that case can there be one and the <lb/>
            same principle in all animals, the principle of attachment <lb/>

            pendent of our will, as if they were good and (or) bad, lie at <lb/>
            the bottom of our opinions, we must of necessity pay regard to tyrants; for I wish that men would pay regard to <lb/>
            tyrants only, and not also to the bedchamber men.6 How <lb/>
            is it that the man becomes all at once wise, when Caesar <lb/>
            has made him superintendent of the close stool ? How is <lb/>
            it that we say immediately, " Felicion spoke sensibly to <lb/>
            me." I wish he were ejected from the bedchamber, that <lb/>
            he might again appear to you to be a fool.</p>
          <p>Epaphroditus7 had a shoemaker whom he sold because <lb/>
            he was good for nothing. This fellow by some good luck <lb/>
            was bought by one of Caesar's men, and became Caesar's <lb/>
            shoemaker. You should have seen what respect Epaphro­ <lb/>
            ditus paid to him: " How does the good Felicion do, I <lb/>
            pray?" Then if any of us asked, "What is master <lb/>
            (Epaphroditus) doing ?" the answer was, " He is con­ <lb/>
            sulting about something with Felicion." Had he not sold <lb/>
            the man as good for nothing ? Who then made him wise <lb/>
            all at once? This is an instance of valuing something else <lb/>
            than the things which depend on the will.</p>
          <p>Has a man been exalted to the tribuneship? All who <lb/>
            meet him offer their congratulations : one kisses his eyes, <lb/>
            another the neck, and the slaves kiss his hands.8 He <lb/>
            goes to his house, he finds torches lighted. He ascends <lb/>
            the Capitol: he offers a sacrifice on the occasion. Now <lb/>
            who ever sacrificed for having had good desires ? for having <lb/>
            acted conformably to nature ? For in fact we thank the <lb/>
            gods for those things in which we place our good.9 <note type="footnote"> 6 Such a man was named in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοιτωνίτης</foreign>; in Latin " cubicu­ <lb/>

          <p>EVERY art and faculty contemplates certain things especially.2 When then it is itself of the same kind with the <lb/>
            objects which it contemplates, it must of necessity contemplate itself also: but when it is of an unlike kind, it <lb/>
            cannot contemplate itself. For instance, the shoemaker's <lb/>
            art is employed on skins, but itself is entirely distinct <lb/>
            from the material of skins: for this reason it does not <lb/>
            contemplate itself. Again, the grammarian's art is em- <note type="footnote"> 10 Casaubon, in a learned note on Suetonius, Augustus, c. 18, informs <lb/>
            us that divine honours were paid to Augustus at Nicopolis, which town <lb/>
            lie founded after the victory at Actium. The priesthood of Augustus <lb/>
            at Nicopolis was a high office, and the priest gave his name to the year; <lb/>
            that is, when it was intended in any writing to fix the year. either in <lb/>
            any writing which related to public matters, or in instruments used in <lb/>

            ployed about articulate speech;3 is then the art also <lb/>
            articulate speech? By no means. For this reason it <lb/>
            is not able to contemplate itself. Now reason, for what <lb/>
            purpose has it been given by nature? For the right use <lb/>
            of appearances. What is it then itself? A system (combination) of certain appearances. So by its nature it has <lb/>
            the faculty of contemplating itself also. Again, sound <lb/>
            sense, for the contemplation of what things docs it belong <lb/>
            to -as? Good and evil, and things which are neither. <lb/>
            What is it then itself ? Good. And want of sense, what <lb/>
            is it ? Evil. Do you see then that good sense necessarily <lb/>
            contemplates both itself and the opposite ? For this reason <lb/>
            it is the chief and the first work of a philosopher to examine appearances, and to distinguish them, and to admit <lb/>
            none without examination. You see even in the matter <lb/>
            of coin, in which our interest appears to be somewhat con­ <lb/>
            cerned, how we have invented an art, and how many <lb/>
            means the assayer uses to try the value of coin, the sight, <lb/>
            the touch, the smell, and lastly the hearing. He throws <lb/>
            the coin (denarius) down, and observes the sound, and he <lb/>
            is not content with its sounding once, but through his <lb/>
            great attention he becomes a musician. In like manner, <lb/>
            where we think that to be mistaken and not to be mistaken make a great difference, there we apply great attention to discovering the things which can deceive. But <lb/>
            in the matter of our miserable ruling faculty, yawning and <lb/>
            sleeping, we carelessly admit every appearance, for the <lb/>
            harm is not noticed.</p>
          <p>When then you would know how careless you are <lb/>
            with respect to good and evil, and how active with respect to things which are indifferent4 (neither good nor <lb/>
            evil), observe how you feel with respect to being deprived <lb/>
            of the sight of the eyes, and how with respect to being <lb/>
            deceived, and you will discover that you are far from <lb/>
            feeling as you ought to do in relation to good and evil. <lb/>
            But this is a matter which requires much preparation, <lb/>
            and much labour and study. Well then do you expect <note type="footnote"> 3 See Schweighaeuser's note. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 " We reckon death among the things which are indifferent (in­ <lb/>

            to acquire the greatest of arts with small labour ? And <lb/>
            yet the chief doctrine of philosophers is very brief. If <lb/>
            you would know, read Zeno's5 writings and you will see <lb/>
            For how few words it requires to say that man's end (or <lb/>
            object) is to follow6 the gods, and that the nature of <lb/>
            good is a proper use of appearances. But if you say <lb/>
            What is God, what is appearance, and what is particular <lb/>
            and what is universal7 nature ? then indeed many words <lb/>
            are necessary. If then Epicurus should come and say, <lb/>
            that the good must be in the body; in this case also many <lb/>
            words become necessary, and wo must be taught what is <lb/>
            the leading principle in us, and the fundamental and the <lb/>
            substantial; and as it is not probable that the good of <lb/>
            a snail is in the shell, is it probable that the good of a <lb/>
            man is in the body ? But you yourself, Epicurus, possess <lb/>
            something better than this. What is that in you which <lb/>
            deliberates, what is that which examines everything, what <lb/>
            is that which forms a judgment about the body itself, that <lb/>
            it is the principal part ? and why do you light your lamp <lb/>
            and labour for us, and write so many8 books? is it that <lb/>
            wo may not be ignorant of the truth, who we are, and <lb/>
            what we are with respect to you? Thus the discussion <lb/>
            requires many words. <note type="footnote"> 5 Zeno, a native of Citium, in the island of Cyprus, is said to have <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>PRAECOGNITIONS are common to all men, and praecognition <lb/>
            is not contradictory to praecognition. For who of us does <lb/>
            not assume that Good is useful and eligible, and in all circumstances that we ought to follow and pursue it ? And <note type="footnote"> I Praecngnitions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προλήψεις</foreign>) is translated Praecognita by John <lb/>
            Smith, Select Discourses, p. 4. Cicero says (Topica, 7): “Notionem <lb/>
            appello quod Graeci turn <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔννοιαν</foreign>, turn <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόληψιν</foreign> dicunt. Ea est insita <lb/>
            et ante percepta cujusque formae cognitio, enodationis indigens." In <lb/>
            the Do Natura Deorum (i. 16) he says : " Quae est enim gens aut quod <lb/>
            genus hominum, quod non habeat sine doctrina. anticipationem quan­ <lb/>
            dam deorum, quam appellat <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόληψιν</foreign> Epicurus? id est, anteceptam <lb/>
            ammo rei quandam informationem, sine qua nec intelligi quidquam <lb/>
            nee quacri nee disputari potest." Epicurus, as Cicero says in the <lb/>
            following chapter (17), was the first who used <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόληψις</foreign> in this sense, <lb/>
            which Cicero applies to what he calls the ingrafted or rather innate <lb/>
            cognitions of the existence of gods, and these cognitions he supposes <lb/>
            to be universal; but whether this is so or not, I do not know. See <lb/>
            i a 2; Tuscul. i. 24; De Fin. iii. 6, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόληψις</foreign> in iv. 8. 6. </note> <lb/>

            who of us does not assume that Justice is beautiful and <lb/>
            becoming? When then does the contradiction arise? <lb/>
            It arises in the adaptation of the praecognitions to the <lb/>
            particular cases. When one man says, He has done well: <lb/>
            he is a brave man, and another says, “ Not so; but he <lb/>
            has acted foolishly;" then the disputes arise among men. <lb/>
            This is the dispute among the Jews and the Syrians and <lb/>
            the Egyptians and the Romans; not whether holiness2 <lb/>
            should be preferred to all things and in all cases should <lb/>
            be pursued, but whether it is holy to eat pig's flesh or <lb/>
            not holy. You will find this dispute also between Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon and Achilles; 3 for call them forth. What do <lb/>
            you say, Agamemnon? ought not that to be done which <lb/>
            is proper and right ? Certainly. Well, what do you say, <lb/>
            Achilles? do you not admit that what is good ought to <lb/>
            be done? I do most certainly. Adapt your praecogni­ <lb/>
            tions then to the present matter. Here the dispute <lb/>
            begins. Agamemnon says, I ought not to give up <lb/>
            Chryseis to her father. Achilles says, You ought. It <lb/>
            is certain that one of the two makes a wrong adaptation <lb/>
            of the precognition of " ought" or " duty." Further, <lb/>
            Agamemnon says, Then if I ought to restore Chryseis, <lb/>
            it is fit that I take his prize from some of you. Achilles <lb/>
            replies, “ Would you then take her whom I love?" <lb/>
            Yes, her whom you love. Must I then be the only man <lb/>
            who goes without a prize ? and must I be the only man <lb/>
            who has no prize? Thus the dispute begins.4</p>
          <p>What then is education? Education is the learning <lb/>
            how to adapt the natural praecognitions to the particular <lb/>
            things conformably to nature; and then to distinguish <lb/>
            that of things some are in our power, but others are not: <lb/>
            in our power are will and all acts which depend on the <lb/>

            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσιᾳ</foreign>) shall we adapt it ? To the things which are in <lb/>
            our power? Is not health then a good thing, and <lb/>
            soundness of limb, and life ? and are not children and <lb/>
            parents and country? Who will tolerate you if you deny <lb/>
            this ?</p>
          <p>Let us then transfer the notion of good to these things. <lb/>
            Is it possible then, when a man sustains damage and <lb/>
            does not obtain good things, that he can be happy? It is <lb/>
            not possible. And can he maintain towards society a <lb/>
            proper behaviour? He can not. For I am naturally <lb/>
            formed to look after my own interest. If it is my in­ <lb/>
            terest to have an estate in land, it is my interest also to <lb/>
            take it from my neighbour. If it is my interest to have a <lb/>
            garment, it is my interest also to steal it from the bath.5 <lb/>
            This is the origin of wars, civil commotions, tyrannies, <lb/>
            conspiracies. And how shall I be still able to maintain <lb/>
            my duty towards Zeus ? for if I sustain damage and am <lb/>
            unlucky, he takes no care of me; and what is he to me <lb/>
            if he cannot help me; and further, what is he to me if be <lb/>
            allows me to be in the condition in which I am? I now <lb/>
            begin to hate him. Why then do we build temples, why <lb/>
            set up statues to Zens, as well as to evil daemons, such <lb/>
            as to Fever;6 and how is Zeus the Saviour, and how the <lb/>
            giver of rain, and the giver of fruits? And in truth if we <lb/>
            place the nature of Good in any such things, all this <lb/>
            follows.</p>
          <p>What should we do then? This is the inquiry of the <lb/>
            true philosopher who is in labour.7 Now I do not see <note type="footnote"> 5 The bath was a place of common resort, where a thief had the <lb/>

            accept any thing which is detached from the nature of good ; <lb/>
            and he is right in maintaining this. How then are we <lb/>

            if a little mouse in the house makes lamentation to him? <lb/>
            But Epicurus knows that if once a child is born, it is no <lb/>
            longer in out- power not to love it nor care about it. For <lb/>
            this reason, Epicurus say s, that a man who has any sense <lb/>
            also does not engage in political matters ; for he knows <lb/>
            what a man must do who is engaged in such things; for <lb/>

            who knows this, ventures to say that we should not bring up <lb/>
            children. But a sheep does not desert its own offspring, <lb/>
            nor yet a wolf; and shall a man desert his child? What <lb/>
            do you mean? that we should be as silly as sheep? but not <lb/>
            even do they desert their offspring: or as savage as wolves, <lb/>
            but not even do wolves desert their young. Well, who <lb/>
            would follow your advice, if he saw his child weeping <lb/>
            after falling on the ground? For my part I think that <lb/>
            even if your mother and your father had been told by an <lb/>

            about pleasure, and about poverty ? He says that to be naked <lb/>
            is better than any purple robe, and to sleep on the bare <lb/>
            ground is the softest bed; and he gives as a proof of each <lb/>

            freedom, and the healthy appearance and compactness of <lb/>
            his body. There is no enemy near, he says; all is peace. <lb/>
            How so, Diogenes ? See, he replies, if I am struck, if I <lb/>
            have been wounded, if I have fled from any man. This is <lb/>
            what a scout ought to be. But you come to us and tell us <lb/>

          <p>IF these things are true, and if we are not silly, and are <lb/>
            not acting hypocritically when we say that the good of <lb/>
            man is in the will, and the evil too, and that every thing <lb/>

          <p>But give me directions. Why should I give you direc­ <lb/>
            tions? has not Zeus given you directions? Has he not <lb/>
            given to you what is your own free from hindrance and <lb/>
            free from impediment, and what is not your own sub­ <lb/>
            jeot to hindrance and impediment ? What directions then, <lb/>
            what kind of orders did you bring when you came <lb/>
            from him ? Keep by every means what is your own; do <lb/>
            not desire what belongs to others. Fidelity (integrity) <lb/>
            is your own, virtuous shame is your own; who then can <lb/>
            take these things from you ? who else than yourself will <lb/>
            hinder you from using them ? But how do you act ? when <lb/>
            you seek what is not your own, you lose that which is your <lb/>
            own. Having such promptings and commands from Zeus, <lb/>
            what kind do you still ask from me ? Am I more powerful <lb/>
            than he, am I more worthy of confidence ? But if you <lb/>
            observe these, do you want any others besides? Well, but <lb/>
            he has not given these orders, you will say. Produce your <lb/>

            what you have said yourself, produce what you have read, <lb/>
            produce what you have meditated on; and you will then <lb/>
            see that all these things are from GOd,1 How long then is <note type="footnote"> 1 The conclusion and you will then see," is not in the text, but <lb/>
            it is what Epictetus means. The argument is complete. If we admit <lb/>
            the existence of God, and that he is our father, as Epictetus teaches, <lb/>
            we have from him the intellectual powers which we possess; and <lb/>
            those men in whom these powers have been roused to activity, and are <lb/>
            exercised, require no other instructor. It is true that in a large part <lb/>
            of mankind these powers are inactive and are not exercised, or if they </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            it fit to observe these precepts from God, and not to break <lb/>
            up the play ? 2 As long as the play is continued with propriety. In the Saturnalia 3 a king is chosen by lot, for it <lb/>
            has been the custom to play at this game. The king commands : Do you drink, Do you mix the wine, Do you sing, <lb/>
            Do you go, Do you come. I obey that the game may not <lb/>
            be broken up through me.—But if he says, think that you <lb/>
            are in evil plight: I answer, I do not think so; and who <lb/>
            will compel me to think so ? Further, we agreed to play <lb/>
            Agamemnon and Achilles. He who is appointed to play <lb/>
            Agamemnon says to me, Go to Achilles and tear from him <lb/>
            Briseis. I go. He says, Come, and I come.</p>
          <p>For as we behave in the matter of hypothetical argu­ <lb/>
            ments, so ought we to do in life. Suppose it to be <lb/>
            night. I suppose that it is night. Well then; is it day? <lb/>
            No, for I admitted the hypothesis that it was night. Suppose that you think that it is night ? Suppose that I do. <lb/>
            But also think that it is night. That is not consistent with <lb/>
            the hypothesis. So in this case also : Suppose that you <lb/>
            are unfortunate. Well, suppose so. Are you then un­ <lb/>
            happy? Yes. Well then are you troubled with an <note type="footnote"> are exercised, it is in a very imperfect way. But those who contem­ <lb/>
            plate the improvement of the human race, hope that all men, or if not <lb/>
            all men, a great number will be roused to the exercise of the powers <lb/>
            which they have, and that human life will be made more conformable <lb/>
            to Nature, that is, that man will use the powers which he has, and <lb/>
            will not need advice and direction from other men, who professing <lb/>
            that they are wise and that they can teach, prove by their teaching <lb/>
            and often by their example that they are not wise, and are incapable <lb/>
            of teaching. </note><note type="footnote"> This is equally true for those who may deny or doubt about the <lb/>
            existence of God. They cannot deny that man has the intellectual <lb/>
            powers which he does possess; and they are certainly not the persons <lb/>
            who will proclaim their own want of these powers. If man has them <lb/>
            and can exercise them, the fact is sufficient; and we need not dispute <lb/>

            spectacle is over, seat yourself in the place reserved for the <lb/>
            Senators and sun yourself. For remember thia general <lb/>
            truth, that it is we who squeeze ourselves, who put ourselves in straits ; that is our opinions squeeze us and put <lb/>
            us in straits. For what is it to be reviled ? Stand by a <lb/>

            But if the reviler has as a stepping-stone (or ladder) <lb/>

            <title type="sub">WHAT IS TIlE LAW OF LIFE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHEN a person was reading hypothetical arguments, <lb/>
            Epictetus said, This also is an hypothetical law that we <lb/>
            must accept what follows from the hypothesis. But much <lb/>
            before this law is the law of life, that we must act conformably to nature. For if in every matter and circumstance we wish to observe what is natural, it is plain that <lb/>
            in every thing we ought to make it our aim that neither <lb/>
            that which is consequent shall escape us, and that we do <lb/>
            not admit the contradictory. First then philosophers <lb/>
            exercise us in theory1 (contemplation of things), which is <lb/>
            easier; and then next they lead us to the more difficult <lb/>
            things; for in theory, there is nothing which draws us <lb/>
            away from following what is taught; but in the matters <lb/>
            of life, many are the things which distract us. He is <lb/>
            ridiculous then who says that he wishes to begin with the <lb/>
            matters of real life, for it is not easy to begin with the <lb/>
            more difficult things ; and we ought to employ this fact as <lb/>
            an argument to those parents who are vexed at their <lb/>
            children learning philosophy: Am I doing wrong then <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ τηςθεωρίας</foreign>. “ Intelligere quid verum rectumque sit, prius <lb/>

            -Wolf, </note><note type="footnote"> This is a profound and useful remark of Epictetus. General prin­ <lb/>
            ciples are most easily understood and accepted. The difficulty is in <lb/>
            the application of them. What is more easy, for example, than to <lb/>
            understand general principles of law which are true and good ? But <lb/>
            in practice cases are presented to us which as Bacon says, are “ im­ <lb/>
            mersed in matter; and it is this matter which makes the difficulty <lb/>
            of applying the principles, and requires the ability and study of <lb/>
            an experienced man. It is easy, and it is right, to teach the young <lb/>
            the general principles of the rules of life; but the difficulty of ap­ <lb/>
            plying them is that in which the young and the old too often fail. <lb/>
            So if you ask whether virtue can be taught, the answer is that the <lb/>
            rules for a virtuous life can be delivered; but the application of the <lb/>
            rules is the difficulty, as teachers of religion and morality know well, <lb/>
            if they are fit to teach. If they do not know this truth, they are <lb/>
            neither fit to teach the rules, nor to lead the way to the practice of <lb/>
            them by the only method which is possible; and this method is by <lb/>
            their own example, assisted by the example of those who direct the <lb/>

            teach me; and if you can not, allow me to learn from those <lb/>
            who say that they know how to teach. For what do you <lb/>

            he than that some man of senatorian rank who sits by <lb/>
            him may admire? For there (at Rome) are the really <lb/>
            great materials (opportunities), and the riches here (at <lb/>
            Nicopolis) appear to be trifles there. This is the reason <lb/>
            why it is difficult for a man to be master of the appearances, <lb/>

            Epictetus said to the teacher, “ You are laughing at your­ <lb/>
            self: you did not prepare the young man nor did you <lb/>
            ascertain whether he was able to understand these matters; <lb/>
            but perhaps, you are only employing him as a reader." <lb/>
            Well then said Epictetus, if a man has not ability <lb/>
            enough to understand a complex (syllogism), do we trust <lb/>
            him in giving praise, do we trust him in giving blame, <lb/>
            do we allow that he is able to form a judgment about good <lb/>
            or bad ? and if such a man blames any one, does the man <lb/>
            care for the blame? and if he praises any one, is the man <lb/>
            elated, when in such small matters as an hypothetical <lb/>
            syllogism he who praises cannot see what is consequent <lb/>
            on the hypothesis ?</p>
          <p>This then is the beginning of philosophy,6 a man's perception of the state of his ruling faculty; for when a man <lb/>
            knows that it is weak, then he will not employ it on things <lb/>
            of the greatest difficulty. But at present, if men cannot <lb/>
            swallow even a morsel, they buy whole volumes and <lb/>
            attempt to devour them ; and this is the reason why they <lb/>
            vomit them up or suffer indigestion: and then come <lb/>
            gripings, defiuxes, and fevers.7 Such men ought to consider what their ability is. In theory it is easy to convince <lb/>
            an ignorant person; but in the affairs of real life no one <lb/>
            offers himself to be convinced, and we hate the man who <lb/>
            has convinced us. But Socrates advised us not to live a <lb/>
            life which is not subjected to examinatiun.8 <note type="footnote"> 6 See ii. c 11. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Seneca, Do Tranquillitate animi, c. 9, says: “ What is the use of <lb/>

            does not instruct him. It is much better to give yourself up to a few <lb/>

            <title type="sub">IN HOW MANY WAYS APPEARANCES EXIST, AND WHAT AIDS WE SHOULD PROVIDE AGAINST THEM.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>APPEARANCES are to us in four ways : for either things <lb/>
            appear as they are; or they are not, and do not even <lb/>
            appear to be; or they are, and do not appear to he; or <lb/>
            they are not, and yet appear to be. Further, in all these <lb/>
            cases to form a right judgment (to hit the mark) is the <lb/>
            office of an educated man. But whatever it is that annoys <lb/>
            (troubles) us, to that we ought to apply a remedy. If the <lb/>
            sophisms of Pyrrho and of the Academics are what annoys <lb/>
            (troubles), we must apply the remedy to them. If it is <lb/>
            the persuasion of appearances, by which some things <lb/>
            appear to be good, when they are not good, let us seek a <lb/>
            remedy for this. If it is habit which annoys us, we must <lb/>
            try to seek aid against habit. What aid then can we find <lb/>
            against habit ? The contrary habit. You hear the igno­ <lb/>
            rant say: " That unfortunate person is dead : his father and <lb/>
            mother are overpowered with sorrow ; 2 he was cut off by <lb/>
            an untimely death and in a foreign land." Hear the contrary way of speaking: Tear yourself from these expressions : oppose to one habit the contrary habit; to sophistry <lb/>
            oppose reason, and the exercise and discipline of reason; <lb/>
            against persuasive (deceitful) appearances we ought to have <lb/>
            manifest praecognitions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προλήεις</foreign>), cleared of all impurities <lb/>
            and ready to hand.</p>
          <p>When death appears an evil, we ought to have this rule <lb/>
            in readiness, that it is fit to avoid evil things, and that <note type="footnote"> 1 Pyrrho was a native of Elis, in the Peloponnesus. He is said to <lb/>
            have accompanied Alexander the Great in his Asiatic expedition <lb/>

              death is a necessary thing. For what shall I do, and <lb/>
              where shall I escape it ? Suppose that I am not Sarpedon,3 <lb/>
              the son of Zeus, nor able to speak in this noble way: I <lb/>
              will go and I am resolved either to behave bravely <lb/>
              myself or to give to another the opportunity of doing so; <lb/>
              if I cannot succeed in doing any thing myself, I will not <lb/>
              grudge another the doing of something noble.-Suppose <lb/>
              that it is above our power to act thus; is it not in our <lb/>
              power to reason thus ? Tell me where I can escape death: <lb/>
              discover for me the country, show me the men to whom I <lb/>
              must go, whom death docs not visit. Discover to me a <lb/>
              charm against death. If I have not one, what do you wish <lb/>
              me to do ? I cannot escape from death. Shall I not escape <lb/>
              from the fear of death, but shall I die lamenting and <lb/>
              trembling? For the origin of perturbation is this, to <lb/>
              wish for something, and that this should not happen. <lb/>
              Therefore if I am able to change externals according to <lb/>
              my wish, I change them; but if I can not, I am ready to <lb/>
              tear out the eyes of him who hinders me. For the nature <lb/>
              of man is not to endure to be deprived of the good, and <lb/>
              not to endure the falling into the evil. Then at last, when <lb/>
              I am neither able to change circumstances nor to tear out <lb/>
              the eyes of him who hinders me, I sit down and groan, and <lb/>
              abuse whom I can, Zeus and the rest of the gods. For if <lb/>
              they do not care for me, what are they to me?—Yes, but <lb/>
              you will be an impious man.—In what respect then will <lb/>
              it be worse for me than it is now ?-To sum up, remember <lb/>
              this that unless piety and your interest be in the same <lb/>
              thing, piety cannot be maintained in any man. Do not <lb/>
              these things seem necessary (true) ?</p>
          <p>Let the followers of Pyrrho and the Academics come <lb/>
            and make their objections. For I, as to my part, have no <lb/>
            leisure for these disputes, nor am I able to undertake the <lb/>
            defence of common consent (opinion).4 If I had a suit even <lb/>
            about a bit of land, I would call in another to defend my <note type="footnote"> a Homer, Iliad, xiL v. 328: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴομεν, ἠὲτψ εὖϰος ὀρέξομεν ἠέ τις <lb/>

            interests. With what evidence then am I satisfied ? With <lb/>
            that which belongs to the matter in hand.5 How indeed <lb/>
            perception is effected, whether through the whole body or <lb/>
            any part, perhaps I cannot explain: for both opinions perplex me. But that you and I are not the same, I know <lb/>
            with perfect certainty. How do you know it ? When I <lb/>
            intend to swallow any thing, I never carry it to your month, <lb/>
            but to my own. When I intend to take bread, I never lay <lb/>
            hold of a broom, but I always go to tho bread as to a <lb/>
            mark.6 And you yourselves (the Pyrrhonists), who take <lb/>
            away the evidence of the senses, do you act otherwise ? <lb/>
            Who among you, when he intended to enter a bath, ever <lb/>
            went into a mill ?</p>
          <p>What then ? Ought we not with all our power to hold to <lb/>
            this also, the maintaining of general opinion,7 and fortifying ourselves against the arguments which are directed <lb/>
            against it ? Who denies that we ought to do this ? Well, <lb/>
            he should do it who is able, who has leisure for it; but as <lb/>
            to him who trembles and is perturbed and is inwardly <lb/>
            broken in heart (spirit), he must employ his time better <lb/>
            on something else. <note type="footnote"> 5 " The chief question which was debated between the Pyrrhonists <lb/>

            those things which are perceived by the senses.”—Schweighaeuser. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH MEN; AND WHAT ARE THE SMALL AND THE GREAT THINGS AMONG MEN.1</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHAT is the cause of assenting to any thing ? The fact <lb/>
            that it appears to be true. It is not possible then to <lb/>
            assent to that which appears not to be true. Why? <lb/>
            Because this is the nature of the understanding, to incline <lb/>
            to the true, to be dissatisfied with the false, and in matters <lb/>
            uncertain to withhold assent. What is the proof of this? <lb/>
            Imagine (persuade yourself), if you can, that it is now <lb/>
            night. It is not possible. Take away your persuasion that <lb/>
            it is day. It is not possible. Persuade yourself or take <lb/>
            away your persuasion that the stars are even in number.2 <lb/>
            It is impossible. When then any man assents to that <lb/>
            which is false, be assured that he did not intend to assent <lb/>
            to it as false, for every soul is unwillingly deprived of the <lb/>
            truth, as Plato says; but the falsity seemed to him to be <lb/>
            true. Well, in acts what have wo of the like kind as we <lb/>
            have here truth or falsehood? We have the fit and the <lb/>
            not fit (duty and not duty), the profitable and the unprofit­ <lb/>
            able, that which is suitable to a person and that which is <lb/>
            not, and whatever is like these. Can then a man think <lb/>
            that a thing is useful to him and not choose it? He can­ <lb/>
            not. How says Medea?3— <lb/>
            “ 'Tis true I know what evil I shall do, <lb/>
            But passion overpowers the better counsel." <lb/>
            She thought that to indulge her passion and take ven­ <lb/>
            geance on her husband was more profitable than to spare <lb/>
            her children. It was so ; but she was deceived. Show her <lb/>
            plainly that she is deceived, and she will not do it; but so <lb/>
            long as you do not show it, what can she follow except <note type="footnote"> 1 See c. 18 of this book. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We cannot conceive that the number of stars is either even or <lb/>

            that which appears to hsrself (her opinion) ? Nothing <lb/>
            else. Why then are you angry with the unhappy <lb/>
            woman that she has been bewildered about the most important things, and is become a viper instead of a human <lb/>
            creature? And why not, if it is possible, rather pity, as <lb/>
            we pity the blind and the lame, so those who are blinded <lb/>
            and maimed in the faculties which are supreme?</p>
          <p>Whoever then clearly remembers this, that to man the <lb/>
            measure of every act is the appearance (the opinion),­ <lb/>
            whether the thing appears good or bad: if good, he is free <lb/>
            from blame; if bad, himself suffers the penalty, for it is <lb/>
            impossible that he who is deceived can be one person, and <lb/>
            be who suffers another person-whoever remembers this <lb/>
            will not be angry with any man, will not be vexed at any <lb/>
            man, will not revile or blame any man, nor hate nor <lb/>
            quarrel with any mail.</p>
          <p>So then all these great and dreadful deeds have this <lb/>
            origin, in the appearance (opinion) ? Yes, this origin and <lb/>
            no other. The Iliad is nothing else than appearance and <lb/>
            the use of appearances. It appeared 4 to Alexander to carry <lb/>
            off the wife of Menelaus : it appeared to Helene to follow <lb/>
            him. If then it had appeared to Menelaus to feel that it <lb/>
            was a gain to be deprived of such a wife, what would have <lb/>
            happened ? Not only would the Iliad have been lost, <lb/>
            but the Odyssey also. On so small a matter then did <lb/>
            such great things depend ? But what do you mean by such <lb/>
            great things ? Wars and civil commotions, and the de­ <lb/>
            struction of many men and cities. And what great matter <lb/>
            is this? Is it nothing ?-But what great matter is the <lb/>
            death of many oxen, and many sheep, and many nests of <lb/>
            swallows or storks being burnt or destroyed ? Are these <lb/>
            things then like those? Very like. Bodies of men are <lb/>
            destroyed, and the bodies of oxen and sheep; the dwell­ <lb/>
            ings of men are burnt, and the nests of storks. What is <lb/>
            there in this great or dreadful ? Or show me what is the <lb/>
            difference between a man's house and a stork's nest, as far <note type="footnote"> 4 This is the literal version. It does not mean “ that it appeared <lb/>
            right," as Mrs. Carter translates it. Alexander never thought whether <lb/>
            it was right or wrong. All that appeared to him was the possessing <lb/>
            of Helene, and he used the means for getting possession of her, as a <lb/>
            dog who spies and pursues some wild animal. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            as each is a dwelling; except that man builds his little <lb/>
            houses of beams and tiles and bricks, and the stork builds <lb/>
            them of sticks and mud. Are a stork and a man then <lb/>
            like things ? What say you ?-In body they are very much <lb/>
            alike.</p>
          <p>Does a man then differ in no respect from a stork? <lb/>
            Don't suppose that I say so; but there is no difference in <lb/>
            these matters (which I have mentioned). In what then <lb/>
            is the difference? Seek and you will find that there is a <lb/>
            difference in another matter. See whether it is not in a <lb/>
            man the understanding of what he does, see if it is not in <lb/>
            social community, in fidelity, in modesty, in steadfastness, <lb/>
            in intelligence. Where then is the great good and evil in <lb/>
            men? It is where the difference is. If the difference is <lb/>
            preserved and remains fenced round, and neither modesty <lb/>
            is destroyed, nor fidelity, nor intelligence, then the man <lb/>
            also is preserved ; but if any of these things is destroyed <lb/>
            and stormed like a city, then the man too perishes; <lb/>
            and in this consist the great things. Alexander, you <lb/>
            say, sustained great damage then when the Hellenes <lb/>
            invaded and when they ravaged Troy, and when his <lb/>
            brothers perished. By no means; for no man is damaged <lb/>
            by an action which is not his own ; but what happened <lb/>
            at that time was only the destruction of storks' nests: <lb/>
            now the ruin of Alexander was when he lost the cha­ <lb/>
            racter of modesty, fidelity, regard to hospitality, and to <lb/>
            decency. When was Achilles ruined ? Was it when <lb/>
            Patroclus died ? Not so. But it happened when he began <lb/>
            to be angry, when he wept for a girl, when he forgot that <lb/>
            he was at Troy not to get mistresses, but to fight. These <lb/>
            things are the ruin of men, this is being besieged, this is <lb/>
            the destruction of cities, when right opinions are destroyed, <lb/>
            when they are corrupted.</p>
          <p>When then women are carried off, when children are <lb/>
            made captives, and when the men are killed, are these not <lb/>
            evils? How is it then that you add to the facts these <lb/>
            opinions? Explain this to me also.-I shall not do that; <lb/>
            but how is it that you say that these are not evils ?-Let <lb/>
            us come to the rules: produce the praecognitions (7rpo­ <lb/>
            : for it is because this is neglected that we can not <lb/>
            sufficiently wonder at what men do. When we intend to <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            judge of weights, we do not judge by guess: where we <lb/>

            by guess. In all cases where it is our interest to know <lb/>
            what is true in any matter, never will any man among us <lb/>

            the first and on the only cause of doing right or wrong, of <lb/>
            happiness or unhappiness, of being unfortunate or fortunate, there only we are inconsiderate and rash. There <lb/>
            is then nothing like scales (balance), nothing like a rule: <lb/>
            but some appearance is presented, and straightway I act <lb/>
            according to it. Must I then suppose that I am superior to <lb/>
            Achilles or Agamemnon, so that they by following appearances do and suffer so many evils: and shall not the <lb/>
            appearance be sufficient for me ?5-And what tragedy has <lb/>
            any other beginning? The Atreus of Euripides, what is <lb/>
            it ? An appearance,6 The Oedipus of Sophocles, what is <lb/>
            it? An appearance. The Phoenix? An appearance. <lb/>
            The Hippolytus ? An appearance. What kind of a man <lb/>

          <p>THE being1 (nature) of the Good is a certain Will; the <lb/>
            being of the Bad is a certain kind of Will. What then <lb/>
            are externals? Materials for the Will, about which the <lb/>
            will being conversant shall obtain its own good or evil. <lb/>
            How shall it obtain the good. If it does not admire2 <lb/>
            (overvalue) the materials; for the opinions about the <lb/>
            materials, if the opinions are right, make the will good: <lb/>
            but perverse and distorted opinions make the will bad. <lb/>
            God has fixed this law, and says, " If you would have any <lb/>
            thing good, receive it from yourself." You say, No, but <lb/>
            I will have it from another.—Do not so : but receive it <lb/>
            from yourself. Therefore when the tyrant threatens and <lb/>
            calls me, I say, Whom do you threaten ? If he says, <lb/>
            I will put you in chains, I say, You threaten my <lb/>
            hands and my feet. If he says, I will cut off your <lb/>
            head, I reply, You threaten my head. If he says, I <lb/>
            will throw you into prison, I say, You threaten the <lb/>
            whole of this poor body. If he threatens me with <lb/>
            banishment, I say the same. Does he then not threaten <lb/>
            you at all? If I feel that all these things do not concern <lb/>
            me, he does not threaten me at all; but if I fear any of <lb/>
            them, it is I whom he threatens. Whom then do I fear? <lb/>

            master of things which are not in my power? And what <lb/>
            are these things to me ?</p>
          <p>Do you philosophers then teach us to despise kings? <lb/>
            I hope not. Who among us teaches to claim against them <lb/>
            the power over things which they possess? Take my <lb/>
            poor body, take my property, take my reputation, take <lb/>
            those who are about me. If I advise any poisons to claim <lb/>
            these things, they may truly accuse me.-Yes, but I intend <lb/>
            to command your opinions also,-And who has given you <lb/>
            this power ? How can you conquer the opinion of another <lb/>
            man? By applying terror to it, he replies, I will conquer <lb/>
            it. Do you not know that opinion conquers itself,3 and is <lb/>
            not conquered by another ? But nothing else can conquer <lb/>
            Will except the Will itself. For this reason too the law <lb/>
            of God is most powerful and most just, which is this: Let <lb/>
            the stronger always be superior to the weaker. Ten are <lb/>
            stronger than one. For what? For putting in chains, <lb/>
            for killing, for dragging whither they choose, for taking <lb/>
            away what a man has. The ten therefore conquer the one <lb/>
            in this in which they are stronger. In what then are the <lb/>
            ten weaker ? If the one possesses right opinions and the <lb/>
            others do not. Well then, can the ten conquer in this <lb/>
            matter ? How is it possible ? If we were placed in the <lb/>
            scales, must not the heavier draw down the scale in which <lb/>
            it is.</p>
          <p>How strange then that Socrates should have been so <lb/>
            treated by the Athenians. Slave, why do you say Socrates ? <lb/>
            Speak of the thing as it is: how strange that the poor <lb/>
            body of Socrates should have been carried off and dragged <lb/>
            to prison by stronger men, and that any one should have <lb/>
            given hemlock to the poor body of Socrates, and that it <lb/>
            should breathe out the life. Do these things seem strange, <lb/>
            do they seem unjust, do you on account of these things <lb/>
            blame God ? Had Socrates then no equivalent for these <lb/>
            things? Where then for him was the nature of good? <lb/>

          <p>But show me that he who has the inferior principles <lb/>
            overpowers him who is superior in principles. You will <lb/>
            never show this, nor come near showing it; for this is the <lb/>
            law of nature and of God that the superior shall always <lb/>
            overpower the inferior. In what? In that in which it is <lb/>
            superior. One body is stronger than another : many are <lb/>
            stronger than one: the thief is stronger than he who is <lb/>
            not a thief. This is the reason why I also lost my lamp,5 <lb/>
            because in wakefulness the thief was superior to me. But <lb/>
            the man bought the lamp at this price: for a lamp ho <lb/>
            became a thief, a faithless fellow, and like a wild beast. <lb/>
            This seemed to him a good bargain. Be it so. But a <lb/>
            man has seized me by the cloak, and is drawing me to the <lb/>
            public place: then others bawl out, Philosopher, what <lb/>
            has been the use of your opinions ? see you are dragged <lb/>
            to prison, you are going to be beheaded. And what <lb/>
            system of philosophy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσαγωγήν</foreign>) could I have made so <lb/>
            that, if a stronger man should have laid hold of my cloak, <lb/>
            I should not be dragged off; that if ten men should have <lb/>
            laid hold of me and cast me into prison, I should not be <lb/>
            cast in? Have I learned nothing else then? I have <lb/>
            learned to see that every thing which happens, if it be <lb/>
            independent of my will, is nothing to me. I may ask, if <lb/>
            you have not gained by this.6 Why then do you seek <lb/>
            advantage in any thing else than in that in which you <lb/>
            have learned that advantage is ?</p>
          <p>Then sitting in prison I say: The man who cries out <lb/>
            in this way 7 neither hears what words mean, nor understands what is said, nor does he care at all to know what <lb/>
            philosophers say or what they do. Let him alone.</p>
          <p>But now he says to the prisoner, Come out from your <lb/>
            prison,-If you have no further need of me in prison, I <lb/>
            come out: if you should have need of me again, I will <lb/>
            enter the prison.—How long will you act thus?-So long <lb/>

            you well.8 Only we must not do it inconsiderately, nor <lb/>
            weakly, nor for any slight reason; for, on the other hand, <lb/>
            God does not wish it to be done, and he has need of such <lb/>
            a world and such inhabitants in it.9 But if he sounds <lb/>
            the signal for retreat, as he did to Socrates, we must obey <lb/>
            him who gives the signal, as if he were a general.10</p>
          <p>Well then, ought we to say such things to the many? <lb/>
            Why should we ? Is it not enough for a man to be per­ <lb/>
            suaded himself? When children come clapping their <lb/>
            hands and crying out, “ To-day is the good Saturnalia," 11 <lb/>
            do we say, " The Saturnalia are not good" ? By no <lb/>
            means, but we clap our hands also. Do you also then, <lb/>
            when you are not able to make a man change his mind, <lb/>
            bo assured that he is a child, and clap your hands with <lb/>
            him; and if you do not choose 12 to do this, keep silent.</p>
          <p>A man must keep this in mind ; and when he is called <lb/>
            to any such difficulty, he should know that the time is <lb/>
            come for showing if he has been instructed. For he who <lb/>
            is come into a difficulty is like a young man from a school <lb/>
            who has practised the resolution of syllogisms; and if any <lb/>

            lines from the centre of a circle to the circumference are <note type="footnote"> as by Sophocles for instance. The use of the word then by Epictetus was <lb/>
            not new, and it may have been used by the Stoic writers long before <lb/>
            his time. The language of the Stoics was formed at least two centuries before the Christian aera, and the New Testament writers would <lb/>
            use the Greek which was current in their age. The notion of " Scrip­ <lb/>

            and is even absurd. Mrs. Carter's remark implies that Epictetus used <lb/>

            the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ γένοιτο</foreign> of Paul, which Epictetus often uses; but this <lb/>
            is a slight matter. The words of Peter (Ep. ii. 1, 4), “ that by these <lb/>
            ye might be partakers of the divine nature," are a Stoic expression. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THAT CONFIDENCE (COURAGE) IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH CAUTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE opinion of the philosophers perhaps seems to some to <lb/>
            be a paradox ; but still let us examine as well as we can, <lb/>
            if it is true that it is possible to do every thing both with <lb/>
            caution and with confidence. For caution seems to be in <lb/>
            a manner contrary to confidence, and contraries are in no <lb/>
            way consistent. That which seems to many to be a para­ <lb/>
            dox in the matter under consideration in my opinion is of <lb/>
            this kind: if we asserted that wo ought to employ caution <lb/>
            and confidence in the same things, men might justly <lb/>
            accuse us of bringing together things which cannot be <lb/>
            united. But now where is the difficulty in what is said ? <lb/>
            for if these things are true, which have been often said <lb/>
            and often proved, that the nature of good is in the use of <lb/>
            appearances, and the nature of evil likewise, and that <lb/>
            things independent of our will do not admit either the <lb/>
            nature of evil nor of good, what paradox do the philo­ <lb/>
            sophers assert if they say that where things are not <lb/>
            dependent on the will, there you should employ confidence, <lb/>
            but where they are dependent on the will, there you <lb/>
            should employ caution ? For if the bad consists in a bad <lb/>
            exercise of the will, caution ought only to be used where <lb/>
            things are dependent on the will. But if things inde­ <lb/>
            pendent of the will and not in our power are nothing to <lb/>
            us, with respect to these we must employ confidence; and <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            thus we shall both be cautious and confident, and indeed <lb/>
            confident because of our caution. For by employing <lb/>
            caution towards things which are really bad, it will result <lb/>
            that we shall have confidence with respect to things which <lb/>
            are not so.</p>
          <p>We are then in the condition of deer;1 when they flee <lb/>
            from the huntsmen's feathers in fright, whither do they <lb/>
            turn and in what do they seek refuge as safe ? They turn <lb/>
            to the nets, and thus they perish by confounding things <lb/>
            which are objects of fear with things that they ought not <lb/>
            to fear. Thus we also act: in what cases do we fear ? In <lb/>
            things which are independent of the will. In what cases <lb/>
            on the contrary do we behave with confidence, as if there <lb/>
            were no danger? In things dependent on the will. To <lb/>
            be deceived then, or to act rashly, or shamelessly or with <lb/>
            base desire to seek something, does not concern us at all, <lb/>
            if we only hit the mark in things which are independent <lb/>
            of our will. But where there is death, or exile or pain or <lb/>
            infamy, there we attempt to run away, there we are struck <lb/>
            with terror. Therefore as we may expect it to happen <lb/>
            with those who err in the greatest matters, we convert <lb/>
            natural confidence (that is, according to nature) into <lb/>
            audacity, desperation, rashness, shamelessness; and we <lb/>
            convert natural caution and modesty into cowardice and <lb/>
            meanness, which are full of fear and confusion. For if a <lb/>
            man should transfer caution to those things in which the <lb/>
            will may be exercised and the acts of the will, he will <lb/>
            immediately by willing to be cautious have also the power <lb/>
            of avoiding what he chooses : but if he transfer it to the <lb/>
            things which are not in his power and will, and attempt <lb/>
            to avoid the things which are in the power of others, he <lb/>
            will of necessity fear, lie will be unstable, he will be dis­ <lb/>
            turbed. For death or pain is not formidable, but the fear <lb/>
            of pain or death. For this reason we commend the poet2 <lb/>
            who said <lb/>
            Not death is evil, but a shameful death. <note type="footnote"> 1 It was the fashion of hunters to frighten deer by displaying feathers <lb/>
            of various colours on ropes or strings and thus frightening them towards <lb/>
            the nets. Virgil, Georg. iii. 372— <lb/>

            Confidence (courage) then ought to be employed against <lb/>
            death, and caution against the fear of death. But now wo <lb/>
            do the contrary, and employ against death the attempt to <lb/>
            escape; and to our opinion about it we employ careless­ <lb/>
            ness, rashness and indifference. These things Socrates3 <lb/>
            properly used to call tragic masks; for as to children <lb/>
            masks appear terrible and fearful from inexperience, we <lb/>
            also are affected in like manner by events (the things <lb/>
            which happen in life) for no other reason than children <lb/>
            are by masks. For what is a child ? Ignorance. What <lb/>
            is a child? Want of knowledge. For when a child knows <lb/>
            these things, he is in no way inferior to us. What is <lb/>
            death? A tragic mask. Turn it and examine it. See, it <lb/>
            does not bite. The poor body must be separated 4 from <lb/>
            the spirit either now or later as it was separated from <lb/>
            it before. Why then are you troubled, if it be sepa­ <lb/>
            rated now? for if it is not separated now, it will be <lb/>
            separated afterwards. Why? That the period of the <lb/>
            universe may be completed,5 for it has need of the pre­ <lb/>
            sent, and of the future, and of the past. What is pain ? <lb/>

            doctrine of all existing things perishing in the course of time and then <lb/>
            being renewed, is of no practical value. The present is enough for most <lb/>

            Epictetus intended to say ‘ we ought to consider that the door is open <lb/>
            for all occasions'; but the occasions, he says, ought to be when things <lb/>
            are such that a man can in no way bear them or cannot honourably <lb/>
            endure them, and such occasions the wise man considers to be the voice <lb/>

          <p>What then is the fruit of these opinions? It is that <lb/>
            which ought to be the most noble and the most becoming <lb/>
            to those who are really educated, release from perturba­ <lb/>
            tion, release from fear, freedom, For in these matters we <lb/>
            must not believe the mary, who say tha t free persons only <lb/>
            ought to be educated but we should rather believe the philo­ <lb/>
            sophers who say that the educated only are free. How is <lb/>
            this ? In this manner. Is freedom any thing else than the <lb/>
            power of living as we choose ? Nothing else. Tell me then, <unclear/> <lb/>
            ye men, do you wish to live in error ? We do not. No one <lb/>
            then who lives in error is free. Do you wish to live in fear ? <lb/>
            Do you wish to live in sorrow ? Do you wish to live in per­ <lb/>
            turbation? By no means. No one then who .,is in a state <lb/>
            of fear or sorrow or perturbation is free; but whoever is <lb/>
            delivered from sorrows and fears and perturbations, he is <lb/>
            at the same time also delivered from servitude. How then <lb/>
            can we continue to believe you, most dear legislators, when <lb/>
            you say, We only allow free persons to be educated ? For <lb/>
            philosophers say we allow none to be free except the <lb/>
            educated; that is, God does not allow it. When then a <lb/>

            He has turned round his own slave before the praetor. <lb/>
            Has he done nothing more? Yes: he is also bound to <lb/>

            not the man who has gone through this ceremony become <lb/>
            free ? No more than he is become free from perturbations. <lb/>

            slave before the praetor. Compare, Persius, Sat. V. 75— <lb/>

            The sum paid on manumission was a tax of five per cent., established <lb/>
            In B.O. 356 (Livy, vii. 16), and paid by the slave. Epictetus here speaks <lb/>
            of the tax being paid by the master; but in iii. 26, he speaks of it as <lb/>
            paid by the enfranchised slave. See Dureau de la Malle, Economie <lb/>

            much?10—But how? As he could not always have at <lb/>
            hand one to argue against his principles or to be argued <lb/>
            against in turn, he used to argue with and examine himself, <lb/>

            a practical way. These are the things which a philosopher <lb/>
            writes. But little dissertations and that method, which I <lb/>

            It is probable that Mrs. Carter is right. Upton thinks that Epictetus <lb/>

          <p>CONSIDER, you who are going into court, what you wish to <lb/>
            maintain and what you wish to succeed in. For if you <lb/>
            wish to maintain a will conformable to nature, you have <lb/>
            every security, every facility, you have no troubles. For <lb/>
            if you wish to maintain what is in your own power and <lb/>
            is naturally free, and if you are content with these, what <lb/>
            else do you care for? For who is the master of such <lb/>
            things? Who can take them away? If you choose to be <lb/>
            modest and faithful, who shall not allow you to be so? <lb/>
            If you choose not to be restrained or compelled, who shall <lb/>
            compel you to desire what you think that you ought not <lb/>
            to desire ? who shall compel you to avoid what you do not <lb/>
            think fit to avoid? But what do you say? The judge <lb/>
            will determine against you something that appears formid­ <lb/>
            able ; but that you should also suffer in trying to avoid it, <lb/>
            how can he do that ? When then the pursuit of objects and <lb/>
            the avoiding of them are in your power, what else do you <lb/>
            care for? Let this be your preface,1 this your narrative, <lb/>
            this your confirmation, this your victory, this your pero­ <lb/>

          <p>Therefore Socrates said to one who was reminding him <lb/>
            to prepare for his trial,2 Do you not think then that I <lb/>
            have been preparing for it all my life ? By what kind of <lb/>
            preparation ? I have maintained that which was in my <lb/>
            own power. How then? I have never done anything <lb/>
            unjust either in my private or in my public life. <note type="footnote"> 1 Epiotetus refers to the rhetorical divisions of a speech. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Xenophon (Mem. iv. c. 8, 4) has reported this saying of Socrates <lb/>

          <p>But if you wish to maintain externals also, your poor <lb/>
            body, your little property and your little estimation, I <lb/>
            advise you to make from this moment all possible prepa­ <lb/>
            ration, and then consider both the nature of your judge <lb/>
            and your adversary. If it is necessary to embrace his <lb/>
            knees, embrace his knees; if to weep, weep; if to groan, <lb/>
            groan. For when you have subjected to externals what is <lb/>
            your own, then be a slave and do not resist, and do not <lb/>
            sometimes choose to be a slave, and sometimes not choose, <lb/>
            but with all your mind be one or the other, either free or <lb/>
            a slave, either instructed or uninstructed, either a well <lb/>
            bred cock or a mean one, either endure to be beaten until <lb/>
            you die or yield at once; and let it not happen to you <lb/>
            to receive many stripes and then to yield. But if these <lb/>
            things are base, determine immediately. Where is the <lb/>
            nature of evil and good? It is where truth is: where <lb/>
            truth is and where nature is, there is caution: where <lb/>
            truth is, there is courage where nature is.3</p>
          <p>For what do you think ? do you think that, if Socrates <lb/>
            had wished to preserve externals, he would have come <lb/>
            forward and said: Anytus and Melitus can certainly kill <lb/>
            me, but to harm me they are not able ? Was he so foolish <lb/>
            as not to see that this way leads not to the preservation <lb/>
            of life and fortune, but to another end ? What is the <lb/>
            reason then that he takes no account of his adversaries, <lb/>
            and even irritates them?4 Just in the same way my <lb/>
            friend Heraclitus, who had a little suit in Rhodes about a <lb/>
            bit of land, and had proved to the judges (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστῖς</foreign>) that <lb/>
            his case was just, said when he had come to the peroration <lb/>
            of his speech, I will neither intreat you nor do I care <lb/>
            what judgment you will give, and it is you father than I <lb/>
            who are on your trial. And thus he ended the business.5 <lb/>
            What need was there of this ? Only do not intreat; but <lb/>
            do not also say,‘ I do not intreat;' unless there is a fit <lb/>
            occasion to irritate purposely the judges, as was the caso <lb/>
            with Socrates. And you, if you are preparing such a <lb/>
            peroration, why do you wait, why do you obey the order <note type="footnote"> 3 Schweighaeuser says that he can extract no sense out of this <lb/>
            passage. I leave it as it is. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 There is some difficulty here in the original. See Schweig.'s note </note><note type="footnote"> 5 The words may mean either what I have written in the text, or <lb/>

             <pb n="105"/>
            to submit to trial? For if you wish to be crucified, wait <lb/>
            and the cross will come: but if you choose to submit and <lb/>
            to plead your cause as well as you can, you must do what <lb/>
            is consistent with this object, provided you maintain what <lb/>
            is your own (your proper character).</p>
          <p>For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, Suggest <lb/>
            something to me6 (tell me what to do). What should I <lb/>
            suggest to you? Well, form my mind so as to accom­ <lb/>
            modate itself to any event. Why that is just the same as <lb/>
            if a man who is ignorant of letters should say, Tell me <lb/>
            what to write when any name is proposed to mo. For if <lb/>
            I should tell him to write Dion, and then another should <lb/>
            come and propose to him not the name of Dion but that of <lb/>
            Theon, what will be done ? what will he write ? But if <lb/>
            you have practised writing, you are also prepared to <lb/>
            write (or to do) any thing that is required. If7 you are <lb/>
            not, what can I now suggest? For if circumstances re­ <lb/>
            quire something else, what will you say, or what will you <lb/>
            do? Remember then this general precept and you will <lb/>
            need no suggestion. But if you gape after externals, you <lb/>
            must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to <lb/>
            the will of your master. And who is the master? He <lb/>
            who has the power over the things which you seek to <lb/>
            gain or try to avoid.8 <note type="footnote"> 6 “ The meaning is, You must not ask for advice when you are come <lb/>

          <p>DIOGENES said well to one who asked from him letters of <lb/>
            recommendation, “ That you are a man, he said, he will <lb/>
            know as soon as he sees you; and he will know whether <lb/>
            you are good or bad, if he is by experience skilful to <lb/>
            distinguish the good and the bad; but if he is without <lb/>
            experience, he will never know, if I write to him ten <lb/>
            thousand times.” 1 For it is just the same as if a drachma <lb/>
            (a piece of silver money) asked to be recommended to a <lb/>
            person to be tested. If he is skilful in testing silver, he <lb/>
            will know what you are, for you (the drachma) will <lb/>
            recommend yourself. We ought then in life also to have <lb/>
            some skill as in the case of silver coin that a man may be <lb/>
            able to say like the judge of silver, Bring me any drachma <lb/>
            and I will test it. But in the case of syllogisms, I would <lb/>
            say, Bring any man that you please, and I will distinguish <lb/>
            for you the man who knows how to resolve syllogisms and <lb/>
            the man who does not. Why ? Because I know how to <lb/>
            resolve syllogisms. I have the power, which a man must <lb/>
            have who is able to discover those who have the power of <lb/>
            resolving syllogisms. But in life how do I act ? At one <lb/>
            time I call a thing good, and at another time bad. What <lb/>
            is the reason ? The contrary to that which is in the case <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>As Epictetus was saying that man is formed for fidelity, <lb/>
            and that he who subverts fidelity subverts the peculiar <lb/>
            characteristic of men, there entered one of those who are <lb/>
            considered to be men of letters, who had once been <lb/>
            detected in adultery in the city. Then Epictetus con­ <lb/>
            tinued, But if we lay aside this fidelity for which we are <lb/>
            formed and make designs against our neighbour's wife, <lb/>
            what are we doing ? What else but destroying and over­ <lb/>
            throwing? Whom, the man of fidelity, the man of <lb/>
            modesty, the man of sanctity. Is this all ? And are we <lb/>
            not overthrowing neighbourhood, and friendship, and the <lb/>
            community ; and in what place are we putting ourselves ? <lb/>
            How shall I consider you, man? As a neighbour, as a <lb/>
            friend? What kind of one? As a citizen? therein shall <lb/>
            I trust you ? So if you wore an utensil so worthless that a <lb/>
            man could not use you, you would be pitched out on the <lb/>
            dung heaps, and no man would pick you up. But if <lb/>
            being a man you are unable to fill any place which befits <lb/>
            a man, what shall we do with you? For suppose that <lb/>
            you cannot hold the place of a friend, can you hold the <lb/>
            place of a slave ? And who will trust you ? Are you not <lb/>
            then content that you also should be pitched somewhere <lb/>
            on a dung heap, as a useless utensil, and a bit of dung? <lb/>
            Then will you say, no man cares for me, a man of letters ? <lb/>
            They do not, because you are bad and useless. It is just <lb/>
            as if the wasps complained because no man cares for <lb/>
            them, but all fly from them, and if a man can, he strikes <lb/>
            them and knocks them down. You have such a sting <lb/>
            that you throw into trouble and pain any man that you <lb/>
            wound with it. What would you have us do with you ? <lb/>
            You have no place where you can be put.</p>
          <p>What then, are not women common by nature?1 So I <note type="footnote"> 1 It is not clear what is meant by women being common by nature in <lb/>
            any rational sense. Zeno and his school said (Diogenes Laertius, vii.; <lb/>
            Zeno, p. 195. London, 1664): ' it is their opinion also that the women </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            say also; for a little pig is common to all the invited <lb/>
            guests, but when the portions have been distributed, go, if <lb/>
            you think it right, and snatch up the portion of him who <lb/>
            reclines next to you, or slily steal it, or place your hand <lb/>
            down by it and lay hold of it, and if you can not tear <lb/>
            away a bit of the meat, grease your fingers and lick them. <lb/>
            A fine companion over cups, and Socratic guest indeed! <lb/>
            Well, is not the theatre common to the citizens? When <lb/>
            then they have taken their seats, come, if you think <lb/>
            proper, and eject one of them. In this way women also <lb/>
            are common by nature. When then the legislator, like the <lb/>
            master of a feast, has distributed them, will you not also <lb/>
            look for your own portion and not filch and handle what <lb/>
            belongs to another. But I am a man of letters and <lb/>
            understand Archedemus.2—Understand Archedemus then, <lb/>
            and be an adulterer, and faithless, and instead of a man, <lb/>

            dice are indifferent. How do I know what the cast will <lb/>
            be ? But to use carefully and dexterously the cast of the <lb/>
            dice, this is my business.2 Thus then in life also the chief <lb/>
            business is this : distinguish and separate things, and say, <lb/>
            Externals are not in my power: will is in my power. <lb/>
            Where shall I seek the good and the bad ? Within, in the <lb/>
            things which are my own. But in what does not belong <lb/>
            to you call nothing either good or bad, or profit or damage <lb/>
            or any thing of the kind.</p>
          <p>What then? Should we use such things carelessly? <lb/>
            In no way: for this on the other hand is bad for the <lb/>
            faculty of the will, and consequently against nature; but <lb/>
            we should act carefully because the use is not indifferent, <lb/>
            and we should also act with firmness and freedom from <lb/>
            perturbations because the material is indifferent. For <lb/>
            where the material is not indifferent, there no man can <lb/>
            hinder me nor compel me. Where I can be hindered and <lb/>
            compelled, the obtaining of those things is not in my power, <lb/>
            nor is it good or bad ; but the use is either bad or good, <lb/>
            and the use is in my power. But it is difficult to mingle <lb/>
            and to bring together these two things, the carefulness of <lb/>
            him who is affected by the matter (or things about him) <lb/>
            and the firmness of him who has no regard for it; but it <lb/>
            is not impossible: and if it is, happiness is impossible. <lb/>
            But we should act as we do in the case of a voyage. What <lb/>
            can I do ? I can choose the master of the ship, the sailors, <lb/>
            the day, the opportunity. Then comes a storm. What <lb/>
            more have I to care for ? for my part is done. The busi­ <lb/>

            I can, not to be drowned full of fear, nor screaming nor <lb/>
            blaming God, but knowing that what has been produced <lb/>
            must also perish: for I am not an immortal being, but a <lb/>
            man, a part of the whole, as an hour is a part of the day: <note type="footnote"> <unclear>3</unclear> Terence says (Adelphi, iv. 7)— <lb/>

            away, whether by being suffocated or by a fever, for I <lb/>
            must pass through some such means ?</p>
          <p>This is just what you will see those doing who play at <lb/>
            ball skilfully. No one cares about the ball3 as being <lb/>
            good or bad, but about throwing and catching it. In this <lb/>
            therefore is the skill, in this the art, the quickness, the <lb/>
            judgment, so that even if I spread out my lap I may not <lb/>
            be able to catch it, and another, if I throw, may catch the <lb/>
            ball. But if with perturbation and fear we receive or <lb/>
            throw the ball, what kind of play is it then, and wherein <lb/>
            shall a man be steady, and how shall a man see the order <lb/>
            in the game ? But one will say, Throw; or Do not throw; <lb/>
            and another will say, You have thrown once. This is <lb/>
            quarrelling, not play.</p>
          <p>Socrates then knew how to play at ball. How ? By <lb/>
            using pleasantry in the court where he was tried. Tell <lb/>
            me, he says, Anytus, how do you say that I do not believe <lb/>
            in God. The Daemons (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίμονες</foreign>), who are they, think <lb/>
            you? Are they not sons of Gods, or compounded of gods <lb/>
            and men? When Anytus admitted this, Socrates said, <lb/>
            Who then, think you, can believe that there are mules <lb/>
            (half asses), but not asses; and this he said as if he were <lb/>
            playing at ball.4 And what was the ball in that case? <lb/>
            Life, chains, banishment, a draught of poison, separation <lb/>
            from wife and leaving children orphans. These were tho <lb/>
            things with which he was playing; but still he did play <lb/>
            and threw the ball skilfully. So we should do : we must <lb/>
            employ all the care of the players, but show the same <lb/>
            indifference about the ball. For we ought by all means <note type="footnote"> 3 The word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁρπαστόν</foreign>, which was also used by the Romans. One <lb/>
            threw the ball and the other caught it. Chrysippus used this simile of <lb/>
            a ball in speaking of giving and receiving (Seneca, Do Beneficiis, <lb/>
            ii. 17). Martial has the word (Epig. iv. 19) ‘ Sive harpasta manu <lb/>
            pulverulenta rapis'; and elsewhere. </note><note type="footnote"> * In Plato's Apology c. 15, Socrates addresses Meletus; and he says, <lb/>

            asses. But Socrates says nothing of mules, for the word mules in some <lb/>

            to apply our art to some external material, not as valuing <lb/>
            the material, but, whatever it may be, showing our art in <lb/>
            it. Thus too the weaver does not make wool, but exercises <lb/>
            his art upon such as he receives. Another gives you food <lb/>
            and property and is able to take them away and your poor <lb/>
            body also. When then you have received the material, <lb/>
            work on it. If then you come out (of the trial) without <lb/>
            having suffered any thing, all who meet you will congratu­ <lb/>
            late you on your escape ; but he who knows how to look <lb/>
            at such things, if he shall see that you have behaved <lb/>
            properly in the matter, will commend you and be pleased <lb/>
            with you; and if he shall find that you owe your escape <lb/>
            to any want of proper behaviour, he will do the contrary. <lb/>
            For where rejoicing is reasonable, there also is congratu­ <lb/>
            lation reasonable.</p>
          <p>How then is it said that some external things are <lb/>
            according to nature and others contrary to nature ? It is <lb/>
            said as it might be said if we were separated from union <lb/>
            (or society) for to the foot I shall say that it is accord­ <lb/>
            ing to nature for it to be clean; but if you take it as a <lb/>
            foot and as a thing not detached (independent), it will <lb/>
            befit it both to step into the mud and tread on thorns, and <lb/>
            sometimes to be cut off for the good of the whole body; <lb/>
            otherwise it is no longer a foot. We should think in some <lb/>
            such way about ourselves also. What are you? A man- <lb/>
            If you consider yourself as detached from other men, it is <lb/>
            according to nature to live to old age, to be rich, to be <lb/>
            healthy. But if you consider yourself as a man and a <lb/>
            part of a certain whole, it is for the sake of that whole <lb/>
            that at one time you should be sick, at another time take <lb/>
            a voyage and run into danger, and at another time be in <lb/>
            want, and in some cases die prematurely. Why then are <lb/>
            you troubled? Do you not know, that as a foot is no <lb/>
            longer a foot if it is detached from the body, so you are <lb/>
            no longer a man if you are separated from other men. <lb/>
            For what is a man?6 A part of a state, of that first which <lb/>
            consists of Gods and of men; then of that which is called <note type="footnote"> 5 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόλυτοι</foreign>. Compare Antoninus, x. 24, viii. 34. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Compare Antoninus, ii. 16, iui. 11, vi. 44, xii. 36; and Seneca, do <lb/>

            next to it, which is a small image of the universal state. <lb/>
            What then must I be brought to trial; must another have <lb/>
            a fever, another sail on the sea, another die, and another <lb/>
            be condemned ? Yes, for it is impossible in such a body, <lb/>
            in such a universe of things, among so many living to­ <lb/>
            gether, that such things should not happen, some to one <lb/>
            and others to others. It is your duty then since you are <lb/>

            as it is fit.7 Then some one says, " I shall charge you <lb/>

            have done my part; but whether you also have done yours, <lb/>
            you must look to that; for there is some danger of this <lb/>

            do you claim that which belongs to another? Always <lb/>
            remember what is your own, and what belongs to another; <lb/>
            and you will not be disturbed. Chrysippus therefore said <lb/>
            well, So long as future things are uncertain, I always <lb/>

            given me the faculty of such choice. But if I knew that <lb/>
            it was fated (in the order of things) for me to be sick, I <lb/>
            would even move towards it; for the foot also, if it had <lb/>

            be reaped?4 for they are not separated from communion. <lb/>
            with other things. If then they had perception, ought <lb/>
            they to wish never to be reaped ? But this is a curse upon <lb/>
            ears of corn, to be never reaped. So we must know that <lb/>
            in the case of men too it is a curse not to die, just the <lb/>
            same as not to be ripened and not to be reaped. But since <lb/>

            we are vexed at it: for we neither know what we are nor <lb/>
            have we studied what belongs to man, as those who have <lb/>
            studied horses know what belongs to horses. But Chry­ <lb/>

            himself when he heard the trumpet sounding a retreat: so <lb/>
            it seemed better to him to obey the general's command <lb/>
            than to follow his own inclination. But not one of us <lb/>
            chooses, even when necessity summons, readily to obey it, <lb/>
            but weeping and groaning we suffer what wo do suffer, <lb/>
            and we call them ' circumstances.' What kind of circum­ <lb/>
            stances, man ? If you give the name of circumstances to <lb/>
            the things which are around you, all things are circum­ <lb/>
            stances ; but if you call hardships by this name, what <lb/>
            hardship is there in the dying of that which has been pro­ <lb/>

            about the way of going down to Hades ? All ways are <lb/>
            equal.6 But if you will listen to the truth, the way which <lb/>
            the tyrant sends you is shorter. A tyrant never killed a <lb/>
            man in six months : but a fever is often a year about it. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">HOW WE OUGHT TO USE DIVINATION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THROUGH an unreasonable regard to divination many of <lb/>
            us omit many duties.1 For what more can the diviner <lb/>
            see than death or danger or disease, or generally things of <lb/>
            that kind ? If then I must expose myself to danger for a <lb/>
            friend, and if it is my duty even to die for him, what need <lb/>
            have I then for divination? Have I not within me a <lb/>
            diviner who has told me the nature of good and of evil, <lb/>
            and has explained to me the signs (or marks) of both? <lb/>
            What need have I then to consult the viscera of victims or <lb/>
            the flight of birds, and why do I submit when he says, It <lb/>
            is for your interest? For does he know what is for my <lb/>
            interest, does he know what is good; and as he has <lb/>
            learned the signs of the viscera, has he also learned the <lb/>
            signs of good and evil? For if he knows the signs of <lb/>
            these, he knows the signs both of the beautiful and of the <lb/>
            ugly, and of the just and of the unjust. Do you tell me, <lb/>
            man, what is the thing which is signified for me: is it life <lb/>
            or death, poverty or wealth? But whether these things <lb/>
            are for my interest or whether they are not, I do not <lb/>
            intend to ask you. Why don't you give your opinion on <lb/>
            matters of grammar, and why do you give it here about <lb/>
            things on which we are all in error and disputing with <lb/>
            one another?2 The woman therefore, who intended to <note type="footnote"> 1 Divination was a great part of antient religion, and, as Epictetus <lb/>
            says, it led men ‘ to omit many duties.' In a certain sense there was <lb/>
            some meaning in it. If it is true that those who believe in God can <lb/>
            see certain t-igns in the administration of the world by which they can <lb/>
            judge what their behaviour ought to be, they can learn what their <lb/>
            duties are. If these signs are misunderstood, or if they are not seen <lb/>
            right, men may be governed by an abject superstition. So the external <lb/>
            forms of any religion may become the means of corruption and of human <lb/>
            debasement, and the true indications of God's will may be neglected. <lb/>
            Upton compares Lucan (ix. 572), who sometimes said a few good <lb/>
            things. </note><note type="footnote"> A man who gives his opinion on grammar gives an opinion on a <lb/>
            thing of which many know something. A man who gives his opinion <lb/>
            on divination or on future events, gives an opinion on things of which <lb/>
            we all know nothing. When then a man affects to instruct on things <lb/>
            unknown, we may ask him to give his opinion on things which are <lb/>
            known, and so we may learn what kind of man he is. </note> <lb/>

            Domitian would seize what she sent, I would rather, she <lb/>
            replied, that Domitian should seize all than that I should <lb/>
            not send it.</p>
          <p>What then leads us to frequent use of divination? <lb/>
            Cowardice, the dread of what will happen. This is the <lb/>
            reason why we flatter the diviners. Pray, master, shall I <lb/>
            succeed to the property of my father? Let us see: let us <lb/>
            sacrifice on the occasion.—Yes, master, as fortune chooses. <lb/>
            -When he has said, You shall succeed to the inheritance, <lb/>
            we thank him as if we received the inheritance from him. <lb/>
            The consequence is that they play upon us.4</p>
          <p>What then should we do? We ought to come (to divina­ <lb/>
            tion) without desire or aversion, as the wayfarer asks of <lb/>
            the man whom he meets which of two roads leads (to his <lb/>
            journey'is end), without any desire for that which leads to <lb/>
            the right rather than to the left, for he has no wish to go by <lb/>
            any road except the road which leads (to his end). In the <lb/>
            same way ought we to come to God also as a guide; as we <lb/>
            use our eyes, not asking them to show us rather such <lb/>
            things as we wish, but receiving the appearances of <lb/>
            things such as the eyes present them to us. But now we <lb/>
            trembling take the augur (bird interpreter)5 by the hand, <lb/>
            and while we invoke God we intreat the augur, and say <lb/>
            Master have mercy on me ;6 suffer me to come safe out of <lb/>
            this difficulty. Wretch, would you have then any thing <lb/>
            other than what is best? Is there then any thing better <lb/>
            than what pleases God? Why do you, as far as is in your <lb/>

          <p>GOD is beneficial. But the Good also is beneficial.2 It is <lb/>
            consistent then that where the nature of God is, there also <lb/>
            the nature of the good should be. What then is the <lb/>
            nature of God ? 3 Flesh ? Certainly not. An estate in <lb/>
            land ? By no means. Fame ? No. Is it intelligence, <lb/>
            knowledge, right reason ? Yes. Herein then simply seek <lb/>
            the nature of the good; for I suppose that you do not seek <lb/>
            it in a plant. No. Do you seek it in an irrational <lb/>
            animal? No. If then you seek it in a rational animal, <lb/>
            why do you still seek it any where except in the supe­ <lb/>
            riority of rational over irrational animals?4 Now plants <lb/>
            have not even the power of using appearances, and for this <lb/>
            reason you do not apply the term good to them. The <lb/>
            good then requires the use of appearances. Does it re­ <lb/>
            quire this use only ? For if you say that it requires this <lb/>
            use only, say that the good, and that happiness and unhap­ <lb/>
            piness are in irrational animals also. But you do not say <lb/>
            this, and you do right; for if they possess even in the <lb/>
            highest degree the use of appearances, yet they have not <lb/>
            the faculty of understanding the use of appearances; and <lb/>
            there is good reason for this, for they exist for the purpose <lb/>
            of serving others, and they exercise no superiority. For <lb/>
            the ass, I suppose, does not exist for any superiority over <lb/>
            others. No; but because we had need of a back which is <lb/>
            able to bear something; and in truth we had need also of <lb/>
            his being able to walk, and for this reason he received <lb/>
            also the faculty of making use of appearances, for other <note type="footnote"> 1 Schweighaeuser observes that the title of this chapter would more <lb/>

            wise he would not have been able to walk. And here then <lb/>
            the matter stopped. For if he had also received the faculty <lb/>
            of comprehending the use of appearances, it is plain that <lb/>

              ' Est deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo;' and Horace, Sat. ii. 6,79, <lb/>
              ' Atque affigit humo divinae particulam aurae.' See i. 14, note 4. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Mrs. Carter has a note here. 'See 1 Cor. vi. 19, 2 Cor. vi. 16, <lb/>
              2 Tim. i. 14,1 John iii. 24, iv. 12,13. But though the simple expression <lb/>
              of carrying God about with us may seem to have some nearly parallel <lb/>
              to it in the Now Testament, yet those represent the Almighty in a more <lb/>
              venerable manner, as taking the hearts of good men for a temple to <lb/>
              dwell in. But the other expressions here of feeding and exercising <lb/>
              God, and the whole of the paragraph, and indeed of the Stoic system, <lb/>
              show the real sense of even its more decent phrases to be vastly <lb/>
              differen. from that of Scripture.' </note><note type="footnote"> The passage in 1 Cor. vi. 19 is, 'What? know ye not that your <lb/>
              body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have <lb/>
              of God and ye are not your own' ? This follows v. 18, which is an <lb/>
              exhortation to 'flee fornication.' The passage in 2 Cor. vi. 16 is 'And </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="120"/>
              silver or of gold, and external? You carry him within <lb/>
              yourself, and you perceive not that you are polluting him <note type="footnote"> what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? for ye are the <lb/>
              temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them <lb/>
              and walk in them,' etc. Mrs. Carter has not correctly stated the sense <lb/>
              of these two passages. </note><note type="footnote"> It is certain that Epictetus knew nothing of the writers of the <lb/>
              Epistles in the New Testament; but whence did these writers learn <lb/>
              such forms of expression as we find in the passages cited by Mrs. <lb/>
              Carter ? I believe that they drew them from the Stoic philosophers who <lb/>
              wrote before Epictetus and that they applied them to the new religion <lb/>
              which they were teaching. The teaching of Paul and of Epictetus <lb/>
              does not differ: the spirit of God is in man. </note><note type="footnote"> Swedonborg says, ' In these two faculties (rationality and liberty) <lb/>
              the Lord resides with every man, whether he be good or evil, they being <lb/>
              the Lord's mansions in the human race. But the mansion of the Lord <lb/>
              is nearer with a man, in proportion as the man opens the superior <lb/>
              degrees by these faculties; for by the opening thereof he comes into <lb/>
              superior degrees of love and wisdom, and consequently nearer to the <lb/>
              Lord. Hence it may appear that as these degrees are opened, so a man <lb/>
              is in the Lord and the Lord in him.' Swedellborg, Angelic Wisdom, <lb/>
              240. Again,' the faculty of thinking rationally, viewed in itself, is not <lb/>
              man's, but God's in man.' </note><note type="footnote"> I am not quite sure in what sense the administration of the Eucharist <lb/>
              ought to be understood in the church of England service. Some English <lb/>
              divines formerly understood, and perhaps some now understand, the <lb/>
              ceremony as a commemoration of the blood of Christ shed for us and of <lb/>
              his body which was broken ; as we see in T. Burnet's Posthumous work <lb/>
              (de Fide et Officiis Christianorum, p. 80). It was a commemoration of <lb/>
              the last supper of Jesus and the Apostles. But this does not appear to <lb/>
              be the sense in which the ceremony is now understood by some priests <lb/>
              and by some members of the church of England, whose notions approach <lb/>
              near to the doctrine of the Catholic mass. Nor does it appear to be the <lb/>
              sense of the prayer made before delivering the bread and wine to the <lb/>
              Communicants, for the prayer is ' Grant us, gracious Lord, so to eat the <lb/>
              flesh of thy dear son Jesus Christ and to drink his blood that our sinful <lb/>
              bodies may be made clean by his body and our souls washed through <lb/>
              his most precious blood and that we may evermore dwell in him and he <lb/>
              in us.' This is a different thing from Epictetus' notion of God being in <lb/>
              man, and also different, as I understand it, from the notion contained in <lb/>
              the two passages of Paul; for it is there said generally that the Holy <lb/>
              Ghost is in man or God in man, not that God is in man by virtue of a <lb/>
              particular ceremony. It should not be omitted that there is after the <lb/>
              end of the Communion service an admonition that the sacramental bread <lb/>
              and wine remain what they were, and that the natural body and blood <lb/>
              of our Saviour Christ, arc in heaven and not hero; it being against the <lb/>
              truth of Chribt's natural body to be at one time in more places than one.' <lb/>
              It was affirmed by the Reformers and the best writers of the English <lb/>
              church that the presence of Christ in the Eucharist is a spiritual </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="121"/>
              by impure thoughts and dirty deeds. And if an image of <lb/>
              God were present, you would not dare to do any of the <lb/>
              things which you are doing: but when God himself is <lb/>
              present withiand sees all and hears all, you are not <lb/>
              ashamed of thinking such things and doing such things, <lb/>
              ignorant as you are of your own nature and subject to the <lb/>
              anger of God. Then why do we fear when we are send­ <lb/>
              ing a young man from the school into active life, lest he <lb/>
              should do anything improperly, eat improperly, have <lb/>
              improper intercourse with women; and lest the rags in <lb/>
              which he is wrapped should debase him, lest fine garments <lb/>
              should make him proud? This youth (if he acts thus) <lb/>
              does not know his own God : he knows not with whom he <lb/>
              sets out (into the world). But can we endure when he <lb/>
              says ' I wish I had you (God) with me.' Have you not <lb/>
              God with you ? and do you seek for any other, when you <lb/>
              have him ? or will God tell you any thing else than this ? <lb/>
              If you were a statue of Phidias, either Athena or Zeus, you <lb/>
              would think both of yourself and of the artist, and if you <lb/>
              had any understanding (power of perception) you would <lb/>
              try to do nothing unworthy of him who made you or of <lb/>
              yourself, and try not to appear in an unbecoming dress <lb/>
              (attitude) to those who look on you. But now because <lb/>
              Zeus has made you, for this reason do you care not how you <lb/>
              shall appear? And yet is the artist (in the one case) like <lb/>
              the artist in the other ? or the work in the one case like <lb/>
              the other? And what work of an artist, for instance, has <lb/>
              in itself the faculties, which the artist shows in making <lb/>
              it ? Is it not marble or bronze, or gold or ivory ? and the <lb/>
              Athena of Phidias when she has once extended the hand <lb/>
              and received in it the figure of Victory 7 stands in that <note type="footnote"> presence, and in this opinion they followed Calvin and the Swiss divines: <lb/>
              and yet in the Prayer book we have the language that I have quoted; <lb/>
              and even Calvin, who only maintained a spiritual presence, said, I that <lb/>
              the verity is nevertheless joined to the signs, and that in the sacrament <lb/>
              we have "true Communion in Christ's body and blood'" (Con­ <lb/>
              temporary Keview, p. 464, August 1874). What would Epictetus have <lb/>
              thought of the subtleties of our days ? </note><note type="footnote"> 7 The Athena of Phidias was in the Parthenon on the Athenian <lb/>
              Acropolis, a colossal chryselephantino statue, that is, a frame work of <lb/>
              wood, covered with ivory and gold (Pausanias, i. 24). The figure of </note> <lb/>

              attitude for ever. But the works of God have power of <lb/>
              motion, they breathe, they have the faculty of using the <lb/>
              appearances of things, and the power of examining them. <lb/>
              Being the work of such an artist do you dishonour him? <lb/>
              And what shall I say, not only that he made you, but also <lb/>
              entrusted you to yourself and made you a deposit to your­ <lb/>
              self? Will you not think of this too, but do you also dis­ <lb/>
              honour your guardianship? But if God had entrusted <lb/>
              an orphan to you, would you thus neglect him? He has <lb/>
              delivered yourself to your own care, and says, I had no <lb/>
              one fitter to intrust him to than yourself: keep him for <lb/>
              me such as he is by nature, modest, faithful, erect, unterri­ <lb/>
              fled, free from passion and perturbation. And then you <lb/>
              do not keep him such.</p>
          <p>But some will say, whence has this fellow got the <lb/>
            arrogance which he displays and these supercilious <lb/>
            looks?—I have not yet so much gravity as befits a. <lb/>
            philosopher; for I do not yet feel confidence in what I <lb/>
            have learned and in what I have assented to: I still <lb/>
            fear my own weakness. Let me get confidence and <lb/>
            then you shall see a countenance such as I ought to have <lb/>
            and an attitude such as I ought to have: then I will <lb/>
            show to you the statue, when it is perfected, when it <lb/>
            is polished. What do you expect ? a supercilious coun­ <lb/>
            tenance? Does the Zeus at Olympia lift up his brow? <lb/>
            No, his look is fixed as becomes him who is ready to <lb/>

            Irrevocable is my word and shall not fail.-Iliad, i. 526.</p>
          <p>Such will I show myself to you, faithful, modest, noble, <lb/>

          <p>It is no common (easy) thing to do this only, to fulfil the <lb/>
            promise of a man's nature. For what is a man? The <lb/>
            answer is, a rational and mortal being. Then by the <lb/>
            rational faculty from whom are we separated?1 From <lb/>
            wild beasts. And from what others ? From sheep and <lb/>
            like animals. Take care then to do nothing like a wild <lb/>
            beast; but if you do, you have lost the character of <lb/>
            a man; you have not fulfilled your promise. See that <lb/>
            you do nothing like a sheep ; but if you do, in this case <lb/>
            also the man is lost. What then do we do as sheep? <lb/>
            When we act gluttonously, when we act lewdly, when we <lb/>
            act rashly, filthily, inconsiderately, to what have we <lb/>
            declined? To sheep. What have we lost? The rational <lb/>
            faculty. When we act contentiously and harmfully and <lb/>
            passionately, and violently, to what have we declined? <lb/>
            To wild beasts. Consequently some of us are great wild <lb/>
            beasts, and others little beasts, of a bad disposition and <note type="footnote"> 9 An allusion to the combatants in the public exercises, who used to <lb/>

            But in all these ways the promise of a man acting as a <lb/>
            man is destroyed. For when is a conjunctive (complex) <lb/>
            proposition maintained ?3 When it fulfils what its nature <lb/>
            promises; so that the preservation of a complex proposi­ <lb/>
            tion is when it is a conjunction of truths. When is a <lb/>
            disjunctive maintained ? When it fulfils what it promises. <lb/>
            When are flutes, a lyre, a horse, a dog, preserved? (when <lb/>
            they severally keep their promise). What is the wonder <lb/>
            then if man also in like manner is preserved, and in like <lb/>
            manner is lost ? Each man is improved and preserved by <lb/>
            corresponding acts, the carpenter by acts of carpentry, <lb/>
            the grammarian by acts of grammar. But if a man <lb/>
            accustoms himself to write ungrammatically, of necessity <lb/>
            his art will be corrupted and destroyed. Thus modest <lb/>
            actions preserve the modest man, and immodest actions <lb/>
            destroy him: and actions of fidelity preserve the faithful <lb/>
            man, and the contrary actions destroy him. And on the <lb/>
            other hand contrary actions strengthen contrary charac­ <lb/>
            ters : shamelessness strengthens the shameless man, <lb/>
            faithlessness the faithless man, abusive words the abusive <lb/>
            man, anger the man of an angry temper, and unequal <lb/>

            avaricious.</p>
          <p>For this reason philosophers admonish us not to be <lb/>
            satisfied with learning only, but also to add study, and <lb/>
            then practice.4 For we have long been accustomed to do <note type="footnote"> 2 This seems to be a proverb. If I am eaten, let me be eaten by the <lb/>

            true, the whole is said to be false,' For the whole is proposed as true : <lb/>

            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διεζευγένον</foreign>) is of this kind: 'pleasure is either bad or good, or <lb/>

            are the things which you were talking about ? Whence <lb/>
            did you produce and utter them. From the lips, and <lb/>
            thence only. Why then do you corrupt the aids provided <lb/>
            by others ? Why do you treat the weightiest matters as if <lb/>
            you were playing a game of dice? For it is one thing <lb/>
            to lay up bread and wine as in a storehouse, and another <lb/>
            thing to eat. That which has been eaten, is digested, <lb/>
            distributed, and is become sinews, flesh, bones, blood, <lb/>

            when you choose you can readily take and show it; but <lb/>
            you have no other advantage from it except so far as to <lb/>
            appear to possess it. For what is the difference between <lb/>
            explaining these doctrines and those of men who have <lb/>
            different opinions? Sit down now and explain according <lb/>
            to the rules of art the opinions of Epicurus, and perhaps <lb/>
            you will explain his opinions in a more useful manner <lb/>
            than Epicurus himself.5 Why then do you call yourself a <note type="footnote">making shoes for example, or other useful things. There are men who <lb/>
            profess to teach religion, and morality, and virtue generally. These <lb/>
            men may tell as what they conceive to be religion, and morality, and <lb/>
            virtue; and those who are said to be taught may know what their <lb/>
            teachers have told them. But the learning of religion, and of morality <lb/>
            and of virtue, mean that the learner will do the acts of religion and of <lb/>
            morality and of virtue; which is a very different thing from knowing <lb/>

            Stoic? Why do you deceive the many? Why do you act <lb/>
            the part of a Jew,6 when you are a Greek? Do you not <lb/>
            see how (why) each is called a Jew, or a Syrian or an <lb/>
            Egyptian ? and when we see a man inclining to two sides, <lb/>
            we are accustomed to say, This man is not a Jew, but he <lb/>
            acts as one. But when he has assumed the affects of one <lb/>
            who has been imbued with Jewish doctrine and has <lb/>
            adopted that sect, then he is in fact and he is named a <lb/>
            Jew.7 Thus we too being falsely imbued (baptized), are <lb/>
            in name Jews, but in fact we are something else. Our <lb/>
            affects (feelings) are inconsistent with our words; we are <lb/>
            far from practising what we say, and that of which we are <lb/>
            proud, as if we knew it. Thus being unable to fulfil even <lb/>
            what the character of a man promises, we even add to it <lb/>
            the profession of a philosopher, which is as heavy a burden, <lb/>

            of Stoic opinions does not make a man a Stoic, or any other <lb/>
            philosopher. A man must according to Stoic principles practise them <lb/>
            in order to be a Stoic philosopher. So if we say that a man is a <lb/>
            religious man, he must do the acts which his religion teaches; for it is <lb/>
            by his acts only that we can know him to be a religious man. What <lb/>
            he says and professes may be false; and no man knows except himself <lb/>
            whether his words and professions are true. The uniformity, regularity, <lb/>
            and consistency of his acts arc evidence which cannot be mistaken. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 It has been suggested that Epictetus confounded under the name <lb/>
            of Jews those who were Jews and those who were Christians. We <lb/>
            know that some Jews became Christians. But see Schweig.'s note 1 <lb/>
            and note 7. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 It is possible, as I have said, that by Jews Epictetus means <lb/>
            Christians, for Christians and Jews are evidently confounded by some <lb/>
            writers, as the first Christians were of the Jewish nation. In book iv. <lb/>
            C;7, Epictetus gives the name of Galilacans to the Jews. The term <lb/>
            Galilaeans points to the country of the great teacher. Paul says <lb/>
            (Romans, it 28), ' For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly-but he <lb/>
            is a Jew which is one inwardly,' etc. His remarks (ii. 17-29) on the <lb/>

            <title type="sub">HOW WE MAY DISCOVER THE DUTIES OF LIFE FROM NAMES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>CONSIDER who you are. In the first place, you are a man; <lb/>
            and this is one who has nothing superior to the faculty of <lb/>
            the will, but all other things subjected to it; and the <lb/>
            faculty itself he possesses unenslaved and free from sub­ <lb/>
            jection. Consider then from what things you have been <lb/>
            separated by reason. You have been separated from wild <lb/>
            beasts : you have been separated from domestic animals <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προβάτων</foreign>), Further, you are a citizen of the world,2 and <lb/>
            a part of it, not one of the subservient (serving), but one <lb/>
            of the principal (ruling) parts, for you are capable of com­ <lb/>
            prehending the divine administration and of considering <lb/>
            the connexion of things. What then does the character <lb/>
            of a citizen promise (profess) ? To hold nothing as pro­ <lb/>
            fitable to himself; to deliberate about nothing as if he <lb/>
            were detached from the community, but to act as the <lb/>
            hand or foot would do, if they had reason and understood <lb/>
            the constitution of nature, for they would never put them­ <lb/>
            selves in motion nor desire any thing otherwise than with <lb/>
            reference to the whole. Therefore the philosophers say <lb/>
            well, that if the good man had foreknowledge of what <lb/>
            would happen, he would co-operate towards his own sick­ <lb/>
            ness and death and mutilation, since he knows 3 that these <lb/>
            things are assigned to him according to the universal <note type="footnote"> I Cicero (do Fin. iv. 10); Seneca, Ep. 95. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See i. 9. M. Antoninus, vi. 44: ' But my nature is rational and <lb/>

            even to assent to it. If a man believes that all is wisely arranged in <lb/>
            the course of human events, he would not even try to resist that which <lb/>
            he knows it is appointed for him to suffer: he would submit and he <lb/>
            would endure. If Epictetus means that the man would actively pro­ <lb/>
            mote the end or purpose which he foreknew, in order that his acts may <lb/>
            be consistent with what he foreknows and with his duty, perhaps the <lb/>
            philosopher's saying is too hard to deal with; and as it rests on an <lb/>
            impossible assumption of foreknowledge, we may be here wiser than <lb/>
            the philosophers, if we say no more about it. Compare Seneca, do <lb/>

            arrangement, and that the whole is superior to the part, <lb/>
            and the state to the citizen,4 But now because we do not <lb/>
            know the future, it is our duty to stick to the things <lb/>
            which are in their nature more suitable for our choice, for <lb/>
            we were made among other things for this.</p>
          <p>After this remember that you are a son. What does <lb/>
            this character promise ? To consider that every thing <lb/>
            which is the son's belongs to the father, to obey him in <lb/>
            all things, never to blame him to another, nor to say or <lb/>
            do any thing which does him injury, to yield to him in all <lb/>
            things and give way, co-operating with him as far as you <lb/>
            can. After this know that you are a brother also, and <lb/>
            that to this character it is clue to make concessions; to be <lb/>
            easily persuaded, to speak good of your brother, never to <lb/>
            claim in opposition to him any of the things which are <lb/>
            independent of the will, but readily to give them up, that <lb/>
            you may have the larger share in what is dependent on <lb/>
            the will. For see what a thing it is, in place of a. lettuce, <lb/>
            if it should so happen, or a seat, to gain for yourself <lb/>
            goodness of disposition. How great is the advantage.5</p>
          <p>Next to this, if you are a senator of any state, remember <lb/>
            that you are a senator : if a youth, that you are a youth: <lb/>
            if an old man, that you are an old man; for each of such <lb/>
            names, if it comes to be examined, marks out the proper <lb/>
            duties. But if you go and blame your brother, I say to <lb/>
            you, You have forgotten who you are and what is your <lb/>
            name. In the next place, if you were a smith and made <lb/>
            a wrong use of the hammer, you would have forgotten the <lb/>
            smith ; and if you have forgotten the brother and instead <lb/>
            of a brother have become an enemy, would you appear not <lb/>
            to have changed one thing for another in that case ? And <lb/>
            if instead of a man, who is a tame animal and social, you <lb/>
            are become a mischievous wild beast, treacherous, and <lb/>
            biting, have you lost nothing ? But, (I suppose) you must <lb/>
            lose a bit of money that you may suffer damage ? And <lb/>
            does the loss of nothing else do a man damage ? If you <note type="footnote"> 4 Antoninus, vi. 42: 'We are all working together to one end, some <lb/>

            had lost the art of grammar or music, would you think <lb/>
            the loss of it a damage ? and if you shall lose modesty, <lb/>
            moderation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καταστολήν</foreign>) and gentleness, do you think the <lb/>
            loss nothing ? And yet the things first mentioned are lost <lb/>
            by some cause external and independent of the will, and <lb/>
            the second by our own fault; and as to the first neither to <lb/>
            have them nor to lose them is shameful; but as to the <lb/>
            second, not to have them and to lose them is shameful and <lb/>
            matter of reproach and a misfortune. What does the <lb/>
            pathic lose ? He loses the (character of) man. What <lb/>
            does he lose who makes the pathic what he is ? Many <lb/>
            other things ; and he also loses the man no less than the <lb/>
            other. What does he lose who commits adultery? He <lb/>
            loses the (character of the) modest, the temperate, the <lb/>
            decent, the citizen, the neighbour. What does he lose who <lb/>
            is angry ? Something else. What does the coward lose ? <lb/>
            Something else. No man is bad without suffering some <lb/>
            loss and damage. If then you look for the damage in <lb/>
            the loss of money only, all these men receive no harm <lb/>
            or damage; it may be, they have even profit and gain, <lb/>
            when they acquire a bit of money by any of these deeds. <lb/>
            But consider that if you refer every thing to a small coin, <lb/>
            not even he who loses his nose is in your opinion damaged. <lb/>
            Yes, you say, for he is mutilated in his body. Well; but <lb/>
            does he who has lost his smell only lose nothing ? Is there <lb/>
            then no energy of the soul which is an advantage to him <lb/>
            who possesses it, and a damage to him who has lost it ?— <lb/>
            Tell me what sort (of energy) you mean,-Have we not a <lb/>
            natural modesty?—We have.-Does he who loses this <lb/>
            sustain no damage? is he deprived of nothing, does he part <lb/>
            with nothing of the things which belong to him ? Have <lb/>
            we not naturally fidelity ? natural affection, a natural dis­ <lb/>
            position to help others, a natural disposition to forbearance ? <lb/>
            The man then who allows himself to be damaged in these <lb/>
            matters, can he be free from harm and uninjured6 What <lb/>

            first place consider what hurt (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βλάβη</foreign>) is, and remember <lb/>
            what you have heard from the philosophers. For if the <lb/>
            good consists in the will (purpose, intention, <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαιέσει</foreign>), <lb/>
            and the evil also in the will,8 see if what you say is <lb/>
            not this: What then, since that man has hurt himself <lb/>
            by doing an unjust act to me, shall I not hurt myself <lb/>
            by doing some unjust act to him? Why do we not <lb/>
            imagine to ourselves (mentally think of) something of <lb/>
            this kind ? But where there is any detriment to the body <lb/>
            or to our possession, there is harm there; and where the <lb/>
            same thing happens to the faculty of the will, there is <lb/>
            (you suppose) no harm; for he who has been deceived or <lb/>
            he who has done an unjust act neither suffers in the head <lb/>
            nor in the eye nor in the hip, nor does be lose his estate; <lb/>
            and we wish for nothing else than (security to) these <lb/>
            things. But whether we shall have the will modest and <lb/>
            faithful or shameless and faithless, we care not the least, <lb/>
            except only in the school so far as a few words are con­ <lb/>
            cerned. Therefore our proficiency is limited to these few <lb/>
            words; but beyond them it does not exist even in the <lb/>
            slightest degree.9</p>

            <title type="sub">WHAT THE BEGINNING OF PHILOSOPHY IS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE beginning of philosophy to him at least who enters <lb/>
            on it in the right way and by the door, is a consciousness <lb/>
            of his own weakness and inability about necessary things. <lb/>
            For we come into the world with no natural notion of a <lb/>
            right angled triangle, or of a diesis (a quarter tone), or of <lb/>
            a half tone; but we learn each of these things by a cer­ <lb/>
            tain transmission according to art; and for this reason <note type="footnote"> 8 See the beginning of ii. 16. </note><note type="footnote"> ' The same remark will apply to most dissertations spoken or written <lb/>
            on moral subjects: they are exercises of skill for him who delivers or <lb/>
            writes them, or matter for criticism and perhaps a way of spending an <lb/>
            idle hour for him who listens; and that is all. Epictetus blames our <lb/>
            indolence and indifference as to acts, and the trifling of the schools of <lb/>

            those who do not know them, do not think that they know <lb/>
            them. But as to good and evil, and beautiful and ugly, <lb/>
            and becoming and unbecoming, and happiness and mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, and proper and improper, and what we ought to <lb/>
            do and what we ought not to do, who ever came into the <lb/>
            world without having an innate idea of them ? Where­ <lb/>
            fore we all use these names, and we endeavour to fit the <lb/>
            preconceptions1 to the several cases (things) thus : he has <lb/>
            done well, he has not done well; he has done as he ought, <lb/>
            not as he ought; he has been unfortunate, he has been <lb/>
            fortunate; he is unjust, he is just: who does not use <lb/>
            these names ? who among us defers the use of them till he <lb/>
            has learned them, as he defers the use of the words about <lb/>
            lines (geometrical figures) or sounds ? And the cause of <lb/>
            this is that we come into the world already taught as it <lb/>
            were by nature some things on this matter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τόπον</foreign>), and <lb/>
            proceeding from these we have added to them self-conceit <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἲησιν</foreign>).2 For why, a man says, do I not know the beau­ <lb/>
            tiful and the ugly? Have I not the notion of it? You <lb/>
            have. Do I not adapt it to particulars ? You do. Do I <lb/>
            not then adapt it properly ? In that lies the whole ques­ <lb/>
            tion; and conceit is added here. For beginning from <lb/>
            these things which are admitted men proceed to that <lb/>
            which is matter of dispute by means of unsuitable adapta­ <lb/>
            tion ; for if they possessed this power of adaptation in <lb/>
            addition to those things, what would hinder them from <lb/>
            being perfect? But now since you think that you pro­ <lb/>
            perly adapt the preconceptions to the particulars, tell me <lb/>
            whence you derive this (assume that you do so). Because <lb/>
            I think so. But it does not seem so to another, and he <lb/>
            thinks that he also makes a proper adaptation; or does he <lb/>
            not think so ? He does think so. Is it possible then that <lb/>
            both of you can properly apply the preconceptions to <lb/>
            things about which you have contrary opinions? It is <lb/>
            not possible. Can you then show us anything better <lb/>
            towards adapting the preconceptions beyond your thinking <lb/>
            that you do ? Does the madman do any other things than <lb/>
            the things which seem to him right? Is then this <lb/>
            criterion sufficient for him also? It is not sufficient. <note type="footnote"> 1 See i. c. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Cicero's use of' opinatio' (Trusc, iv. 11). </note> <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <lb/>

            Come then to something which is superior to seeming <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ δοκεῖν</foreign>). What is this ?</p>
          <p>Observe, this is the beginning of philosophy, a percep­ <lb/>
            tion of the disagreement of men with one another, and <lb/>
            an inquiry into the cause of the disagreement, and a <lb/>
            condemnation and distrust of that which only ' seems,' <lb/>
            and a certain investigation of that which ' seems' whether <lb/>
            it' seems' rightly, and a discovery of some rule (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κανόνος</foreign>), <lb/>
            as we have discovered a balance in the determination of <lb/>
            weights, and a carpenter's rule (or square) in the case of <lb/>
            straight and crooked things.—This is the beginning of <lb/>
            philosophy. Must we say that all things are right which <lb/>
            seem so to all ?3 And how is it possible that contradictions <lb/>
            can be right?-Not all then, but all which seem to us to be <lb/>
            right.-How more to you than those which seem right to the <lb/>
            Syrians ? why more than what seem right to the Egyptians ? <lb/>
            why more than what seems right to me or to any other man ? <lb/>
            Not at all more. What then ' seems' to every man is not <lb/>
            sufficient for determining what' is;' for neither in the case <lb/>
            of weights or measures are we satisfied with the bare ap­ <lb/>
            pearance, but in each case we have discovered a certain <lb/>
            rule. In this matter then is there no rule superior to <lb/>
            what ' seems' ? And how is it possible that the most <lb/>
            necessary things among men should have no sign (mark), <lb/>
            and be incapable of being discovered? There is then <lb/>
            some rule. And why then do we not seek the rule and <lb/>
            discover it, and afterwards use it without varying from it, <lb/>
            not even stretching out the finger without it ? 4 For this, <lb/>
            I think, is that which when it is discovered cures of their <lb/>
            madness those who use mere ' seeming' as a measure, and <lb/>
            misuse it; so that for the future proceeding from certain <lb/>
            things (principles) known and made clear we may use in <lb/>
            the case of particular things the preconceptions which are <lb/>
            distinctly fixed.</p>
          <p>What is the matter presented to us about which we are <lb/>
            inquiring? Pleasure (for example). Subject it to the <lb/>
            rule, throw it into the balance. Ought the good to be <note type="footnote"> 3 See Schweig.'s note. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Doing nothing without the rule. This is a Greek proverb, used <lb/>
            also by Persius, Sat. v. 119; compare Cicero, de Fin. iii. 17; and <lb/>
            Antoninus, iL 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            such a thing that it is fit that we have confidence in it ? <lb/>
            Yes. And in which we ought to confide ? It ought to <lb/>
            be. Is it fit to trust to any thing which is insecure? <lb/>
            No. Is then pleasure any thing secure? No. Take it <lb/>
            then and throw it out of the scale, and drive it far away <lb/>
            from the place of good things. But if you are not sharp­ <lb/>
            sighted, and one balance is not enough for you, bring <lb/>
            another. Is it fit to be elated over what is good ? Yes. <lb/>
            Is it proper then to be elated over present pleasure ? See <lb/>
            that you do not say that it is proper; but if you do, I <lb/>
            shall then not think you worthy even of the balance.5 <lb/>
            Thus things are tested and weighed when the rules are <lb/>
            ready. And to philosophize is this, to examine and con­ <lb/>
            firm the rules; and then to use them when they are <lb/>
            known is the act of a wise and good man.6</p>

          <p>WHAT things a mail must learn in order to be able to <lb/>
            apply the art of disputation, has been accurately shown by <lb/>
            our philosophers (the Stoics) ; but with respect to the <lb/>
            proper use of the things, we are entirely without practice. <lb/>
            Only give to any of us, whom you please, an illiterate man <lb/>
            to discuss with, and he can not discover how to deal with <lb/>
            the man. But when he has moved the man a little, if he <lb/>
            answers beside the purpose, he does not know how to treat <lb/>
            him, but he then either abuses or ridicules him, and says, <lb/>
            He is an illiterate man; it is not possible to do any thing <note type="footnote"> I That is, so far shall I consider you from being able to judge rightly <lb/>
            of things without a balance that I shall understand that not even with <lb/>

            with him. Now a guide, when he has found a man out of <lb/>
            the road leads him into the right way : he does not ridi­ <lb/>

            the illiterate man the truth, and you will see that he fel­ <lb/>
            lows. But so long as you do not show him the truth, do <lb/>
            not ridicule him, but rather feel your own incapacity.</p>
          <p>How then did Socrates act? He used to compel his <lb/>
            adversary in disputation to bear testimony to him, and <lb/>
            he wanted no other witness, 1 Therefore he could say, ' I <lb/>
            care not for other witnesses, but I am always satisfied <lb/>
            with the evidence (testimony) of my adversary, and I do <lb/>
            not ask the opinion of others, but only the opinion of him <lb/>
            who is disputing with me.' For he used to make the <lb/>
            conclusions drawn from natural notions2 so plain that <lb/>
            every man saw the contradiction (if it existed) and with­ <lb/>
            drew from it (thus): Does the envious3 man rejoice ? By <lb/>
            no means, but he is rather pained.4 Well, Do you think <lb/>
            that envy is pain over evils ? and what envy is there of <lb/>
            evils ? Therefore he made his adversary say that envy is <lb/>
            pain over good things. Well then, would any man envy <lb/>
            those who are nothing to him? By no means. Thus <lb/>
            having completed the notion and distinctly fixed it he <note type="footnote"> 1 This is what is said in the Gorgias of Plato, p. 472, 474. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓννοιαι</foreign>, which Cicero explains to be the same as <lb/>

            be this: ' it is the pain or vexation which men have at the pro­ <lb/>
            sperity of their friends, and that such are the only envious persons.' <lb/>
            Bishop Butler gives a better definition; at least a more complete de­ <lb/>
            scription of the thing. ' Emulation is merely the desire and hope of <lb/>
            equality with or superiority over others, with whom we may compare <lb/>
            ourselves. There does not appear to be any other grief in the natural <lb/>
            passion, but only that want which is implied in desire. However this <lb/>
            may be so strong as to be the occasion of great grief. To desire the <lb/>
            attainment of this equality or superiority, by the particular means of <lb/>
            others being brought down to our level, or below it, is, I think, the <lb/>
            distinct notion of envy. From whence it is easy to see, that the real <lb/>
            end which the natural passion, emulation, and which tho unlawful <lb/>
            one, envy, aims at is the same; namely, that equality or superiority: <lb/>
            and consequently that to do mischief is not the end of envy, but merely <lb/>
            the means it makes use of to attain its end.'—Sermons upon Human <lb/>

            would go away without saying to his adversary, Define to <lb/>
            me envy; and if the adversary had defined envy, he did <lb/>
            not say, You have defined it badly, for the terms of the <lb/>
            definition do not correspond to the thing defined—These <lb/>
            are technical terms, and for this reason disagreeable and <lb/>
            hardly intelligible to illiterate men, which terms we <lb/>
            (philosophers) cannot lay aside. But that the illiterate <lb/>
            man himself, who follows the appearances presented to <lb/>
            him, should be able to concede any thing or reject it, we <lb/>
            can never by the use of these terms move him to do.5 <lb/>
            Accordingly being conscious of our own inability, we do <lb/>
            not attempt the thing; at least such of us as have any <lb/>
            caution do not. But the greater part and the rash, when <lb/>
            they enter into such disputations, confuse themselves and <lb/>
            confuse others ; and finally abusing their adversaries and <lb/>
            abused by them, they walk away.</p>
          <p>Now this was the first and chief peculiarity of Socrates, <lb/>
            never to be irritated in argument, never to utter any thing <lb/>
            abusive, any thing insulting, but to bear with abusive <lb/>
            persons and to put an end to the quarrel. If you would <lb/>
            know what great power he had in this way, read the <lb/>
            Symposium of Xenophon,6 and you will see how many <lb/>
            quarrels he put an end to. Hence with good reason in the <lb/>
            poets also this power is most highly praised, <lb/>
            Quickly with skill he settles great disputes. <lb/>

          <p>Well then; the matter is not now very safe, and particu­ <lb/>
            larly at Rome; for he who attempts to do it, must not do <lb/>
            it in a corner, you may be sure, but must go to a man of <lb/>
            consular rank, if it so happen, or to a rich man, and ask <lb/>
            him, Can you tell me, Sir, to whose care you have en­ <lb/>

            them to any person indifferently and to one who has no <lb/>
            experience of horses ?-By no means.-Well then ; can <lb/>

            things or your vestments ? I don't entrust ever, these to <note type="footnote"> 5 I am not sure that I hate understood rightly <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξὧν δὲ αὐτὁς</foreign> at the <lb/>

            any one indifferently. Well; your own body, have you <lb/>
            already considered about entrusting the care of it to any <lb/>
            person?—Certainly.—To a man of experience, I suppose, <lb/>
            and one acquainted with the aliptic,7 or with the healing <lb/>
            art?—Without doubt..-Are these the best things that you <lb/>
            have, or do you also possess something else which is better <lb/>
            than all these What kind of a thing do you mean ?— <lb/>
            That I mean which makes use of these things, and tests <lb/>
            each of them, and deliberates,-Is it the soul that you <lb/>
            mean ?—You think right, for it is the soul that I mean.- <lb/>
            In truth I do think that the soul is a much better thing <lb/>
            than all the others which I possess.-Can you then show <lb/>
            us in what way you have taken care of the soul ? for it is <lb/>
            not likely that you, who are so wise a man and have a <lb/>
            reputation in the city, inconsiderately and carelessly allow <lb/>
            the most valuable thing that you possess to be neglected <lb/>
            and to perish,--Certainly not.-But have you taken care <lb/>
            of the soul yourself; and have you learned from another <lb/>
            to do this, or have you discovered the means yourself ?-- <lb/>
            Here comes the danger that in the first place he may say, <lb/>
            What is this to you, my good man, who are you? Next, if <lb/>
            you persist in troubling him, there is danger that he may <lb/>
            raise his hands and give you blows. I was once myself <lb/>
            also an admirer of this mode of instruction until I fell into <lb/>
            these dangers.8</p>

            player when he is singing by himself has no anxiety, but <lb/>
            when be enters the theatre, he is anxious even if he has a <lb/>
            good voice and plays well on the lute; for he not only <lb/>
            wishes to sing well, but also to obtain applause: but this <lb/>
            is not in his power. Accordingly, where he has skill, <lb/>
            there he has confidence. Bring any single person who <lb/>
            knows nothing of music, and the musician does not care <lb/>
            for him. But in the matter where a man knows nothing <lb/>
            and has not been practised, there he is anxious. What <lb/>
            matter is this ? He knows not what a crowd is or what <lb/>
            the praise of a crowd is. However he has learned to <lb/>
            strike the lowest chord and the highest;1 but what the <lb/>
            praise of the many is, and what power it has in life he <lb/>
            neither knows nor has he thought about it. Hence he <lb/>
            must of necessity trumble and grow pale. I cannot then <lb/>
            say that a man is not a lute player when I see him <lb/>
            afraid, but I can say something else, and not one thing, <lb/>
            but many. And first of all I call him a stranger and say, <lb/>
            This man does not know in what part of the world he is, <lb/>
            but though he has been here so long, he is ignorant of <lb/>
            the laws of the State and the customs, and what is per­ <lb/>
            mitted and what is not; and he has never employed any <lb/>
            lawyer to tell him and to explain the laws. But a man <lb/>
            does not write a will, if he does not know how it ought to <lb/>
            be written, or he employs a person who does know; nor <lb/>
            does he rashly seal a bond or write a security. But he <lb/>
            uses his desire without a lawyer's advice, and aversion, <lb/>
            and pursuit (movement), and attempt and purpose. How <lb/>
            do you mean without a lawyer ? He does not know that <lb/>
            he wills what is not allowed, and does not will that which <lb/>
            is of necessity; and he does not know either what is his <lb/>
            own or what is another man's; but if he did know, he <lb/>
            would never be impeded, he would never be hindered, he <lb/>
            would not be anxious. How so ?-Is any man then afraid <lb/>
            about things which are not evils ?-No.-Is he afraid <lb/>
            about things which are evils, but still so far within his <lb/>
            power that they may not happen ?-Certainly he is not.­ <lb/>
            fthen the things which are independent of the will are <lb/>
            neither good nor bad, and all things which do depend on <note type="footnote"> 1 See i. 29, note 20. </note> <lb/>

            the will are within our power, and no man can either take <lb/>
            them from us or give them to us, if we do not choose, <lb/>
            where is room left for anxiety ? But we are anxious about <lb/>
            our poor body, our little property, about the will of Caesar; <lb/>
            but not anxious about things internal. Are we anxious <lb/>
            about not forming a false opinion ?-No, for this is in my <lb/>
            power.-About not exerting our movements contrary to <lb/>
            nature?-No, not even about this.-When then you <lb/>
            see a man pale, as the physician says, judging from the <lb/>
            complexion, this man's spleen is disordered, that man's <lb/>
            liver; so also say, this man's desire and aversion are dis­ <lb/>
            ordered, he is not in the right way, he is in a fever. For <lb/>
            nothing else changes the colour, or causes trembling or <lb/>
            chattering of the teeth, or causes a man to <lb/>

          <p>For this reason when Zeno was going to meet Antigonus,2 <lb/>
            he was not anxious, for Antigonus had no power over any <lb/>
            of the things which Zeno admired; and Zeno did not care <lb/>
            for those things over which Antigonus had power. But <lb/>
            Antigonus was anxious when he was going to meet Zeno, <lb/>
            for he wished to please Zeno; but this was a thing <lb/>
            external (out of his power). But Zeno did not want to <lb/>
            please Antigonus; for no man who is skilled in any art <lb/>
            wishes to please one who has no such skill.</p>
          <p>Should I try to please you? Why? I suppose, you <lb/>
            know the measure by which one man is estimated by <lb/>
            another. Have you taken pains to learn what is a good <lb/>
            man and what is a bad man, and how a man becomes one <lb/>
            or the other? Why then are you not good yourself? <lb/>
            --How, he replies, am I not good ?-Because no good man <lb/>
            laments or groans or weeps, no good man is pale and <lb/>
            trembles, or says, How will he receive me, how will he <lb/>
            listen to me ?-Slave, just as it pleases him. Why do you <lb/>
            care about what belongs to others ? Is it now his fault if <lb/>
            he receives badly what proceeds from you ?-Certainly.- <note type="footnote">2 In Diogenes Laertius (Zeno, vii.) there is a letter from Antigonus <lb/>
            to Zeno and Zeno's answer. Simplicius (note on the Encheiridion, c. 51) <lb/>

            reasonable; but I am anxious how I shall speak to him. <lb/>

            you learn in the school ? Syllogisms and sophistical pro­ <lb/>
            positions? 3 For what purpose? was it not for the purpose <lb/>
            of discoursing skilfully ? and is not discoursing skilfully <lb/>
            the same as discoursing seasonably and cautiously and <lb/>
            with intelligence, and also without making mistakes and <lb/>
            without hindrance, and besides all this with confidence?— <lb/>
            Yes.—When then you are mounted on a horse and go into <lb/>
            a plain, are you anxious at being matched against a man <lb/>
            who is on foot, and anxious in a matter in which you are <lb/>
            practised, and he is not ?—Yes, but that person (to whom <lb/>
            I am going to speak) has power to kill me.4 Speak the <lb/>
            truth then, unhappy man, and do not brag, nor claim to <lb/>
            be a philosopher, nor refuse to acknowledge your masters, <lb/>

          <p>WHEN a certain Roman entered with his son and listened <lb/>
            to one reading, Epictetus said, This is the method of in­ <lb/>
            struction ; and he stopped. When the Roman asked him <lb/>
            to go on, Epictetus said, Every art when it is taught <lb/>
            causes labour to him who is unacquainted with it and <lb/>
            is unskilled in it, and indeed the things which proceed <lb/>
            from the arts immediately show their use in the purpose <lb/>
            for which they were made ; and most of them contain some­ <lb/>
            thing attractive and pleasing. For indeed to be present <lb/>
            and to observe how a shoemaker learns is not a pleasant <lb/>
            thing; but the shoe is useful and also not disagreeable to <lb/>
            look at. And the discipline of a smith when he is learning <lb/>
            is very disagreeable to one who chances to be present and <lb/>
            is a stranger to the art: but the work shows the use of <lb/>
            the art. But you will see this much more in music ; for <lb/>
            if you are present while a person is learning, the disci­ <lb/>
            pline will appear most disagreeable; and yet the results <lb/>
            of music are pleasing and delightful to those who know <lb/>
            nothing of music. And here we conceive the work of a <lb/>
            philosopher to be something of this kind: he must adapt <lb/>
            his wish (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βούλησιν</foreign>) to what is going on,1 so that neither <lb/>
            any of the things which are taking place shall take place <lb/>
            contrary to our wish, nor any of the things which do not <lb/>
            take place shall not take place when we wish that they <note type="footnote"> 6 There is some corruption here. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Encheiridion, c. 8: . Do not seek (wish) that things which take <lb/>

            rranged the work of philosophy, not to fail in the desire, <lb/>
            or to fall in with that which they would avoid ; without <lb/>

            laintaining the relations both natural and acquired,2 as <lb/>
            he relation of son, of father, of brother, of citizen, of man, <lb/>

            ccomplished.</p>
          <p>We see then that the carpenter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τέκτων</foreign>) when he has <lb/>

            hilosophy also not be sufficient to wish to be wise and good, <lb/>
            lId that there is also a necessity to learn certain things? <lb/>
            Ve inquire then what these things are. The philosophers <lb/>
            ay that we ought first to learn that there is a God and <lb/>
            hat he provides for all things; also that it is not possible <lb/>

            houghts.3 The next thing is to learn what is the nature <note type="footnote"> 2 Compare iii. 2. 4, iv. 8. 20. Antoninus (viii. 27) writes: ' There are <lb/>
            ree relations [between thee and other things]: the one to the body <lb/>
            Mich surrounds thee; the second to the divine cause from which all <lb/>

            if that expression be not accepted, we may say that we conceive that <lb/>
            exists and we cannot help thinking so. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 See i. 14. 13, ii. 8. ]4. Socrates (Xen. Mem. i. 1. 19) said the <lb/>

            ntoninus, x. 8.—See Plato, De Legg. i. 4. (Upton.) <lb/>
            When God is said to provide for all things, this is what the Greeks <lb/>
            lled <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόνια</foreign>, providence. (Epictetus, i. 16, iii. 17.) In the second of <lb/>
            ese passages there is a short answer to some objections made to <lb/>
            rovidence. <lb/>
            Epictetus could only know or believe what God is by the observation <lb/>
            phaenomena; and he could only know what he supposed to be God'a <lb/>
            ovidence by observing his administration of the world and all that <lb/>
            appens in it. Among other works of God is man, who possesses </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            of the Gods; for such as they are discovered to be, he, who <lb/>
            would please and obey them, must try with all his power <lb/>
            to be like them. If the divine is faithful, man also must <lb/>
            be faithful; if it is free, man also must be free; if bene­ <lb/>
            ficent, man also must be beneficent; if magnanimous, man <lb/>
            also must be magnanimous; as being then an imitator of <lb/>
            God he must do and say every thing consistently with this <lb/>
            fact.</p>
          <p>With what then must we begin ? If you will enter on <lb/>
            the discussion, I will tell you that you must first under­ <lb/>
            stand names 4 (words).—So then you say that 1 do not <lb/>
            now understand names.—You do not understand them.- <lb/>
            How then do I use them?—Just as the illiterate use <lb/>
            written language, as cattle use appearances: for use is <lb/>
            one thing, understanding is another. But if you think <lb/>
            that you understand them, produce whatever word you <lb/>
            please, and let us try whether we understand it.-But it <lb/>
            is a disagreeable thing for a man to be confuted who is <lb/>
            now old, and, it may be, has now served his three cam­ <lb/>
            paigns.—I too know this: for now you are come to me as <lb/>
            if you were in want of nothing: and what could you even <lb/>
            imagine to be wanting to you? You are rich, you have <lb/>
            children and a wife perhaps, and many slaves: Caesar <note type="footnote"> certain intellectual powers which enable him to form a judgment of <lb/>
            God's works, and a judgment of man himself. Man has or is supposed <lb/>
            to have certain moral sentiments, or a capacity of acquiring them in <lb/>
            some way. On the supposition that all man's powers are the gift of <lb/>
            God, man's power of judging what happens in the world under God's <lb/>
            providence is the gift of God ; and if he should not be satisfied with <lb/>
            God's administration, we have the conclusion that man, whose powers <lb/>
            are from God, condemns that administration which is also from God. <lb/>
            Thus God and man, who is God'a work, are in opposition to one <lb/>
            another. </note><note type="footnote"> If a man rejects the belief in a deity and in a providence, because <lb/>

            he will be consistent in rejecting the notion of a deity and of provi­ <lb/>

            But you have a fever: go without food to-day; drink <lb/>

            you are now persuaded that it is night, do not change your <lb/>
            mind, if you think fit, but persist and say, we ought to <lb/>
            abide by our determinations. Will you not make the <lb/>
            beginning and lay the foundation in an inquiry whether <lb/>
            the determination is sound or not sound, and so then build <lb/>
            on it firmness and security ? But if you lay a rotten and <lb/>
            ruinous foundation, will not your miserable little building <lb/>
            fall down the sooner, the more and the stronger are the <lb/>
            materials which you shall lay on it ? Without any reason <lb/>
            would you withdraw from us out of life a man who is a <lb/>

            never be my lot to have a wise fool for my friend: nothing <lb/>
            is more untractable. 'I am determined,' the man says. <lb/>
            Madmen are also; but the more firmly they form a judg­ <lb/>
            ment on things which do not exist, the more ellebore 4 <lb/>
            they require. Will you not act like a sick man and call in <lb/>
            the physician ?—I am sick, master, help me; consider <lb/>
            what I must do: it is my duty to obey you. So it is here <lb/>
            also: I know not what I ought to do, but I am come to <lb/>
            learn.-Not so; but speak to me about other things: upon <lb/>
            this I have determined.-What other things? for what is <lb/>
            greater and more useful than for you to be persuaded that <lb/>
            it is not sufficient to have made your determination and <lb/>
            not to change it. This is the tone (energy) of madness, <lb/>
            not of health.—I will die, if you compel me to this.- Why, <lb/>
            man? What has happened ?—I have determined—I have <lb/>
            had a lucky escape that you have not determined to kill <lb/>
            me—I take no money.5 Why ?—I have determined-Be <lb/>
            assured that with the very tone (energy) which you now <lb/>
            use in refusing to take, there is nothing to hinder you at <lb/>
            some time from inclining without reason to take money and <lb/>
            then saying, I have determined. As in a distempered <lb/>
            body, subject to defluxions, the humour inclines sometimes <lb/>
            to these parts, and then to those, so too a sickly soul knows <lb/>
            not which way to incline: but if to this inclination and <lb/>
            movement there is added a tone (obstinate resolution), <lb/>
            then the evil becomes past help and cure. <note type="footnote"> 3 The meaning is that you cannot lead a fool from his purpose either <lb/>
            by words or force. 'A wise fool' must mean a fool who thinks himself <lb/>
            wise; and such we sometimes see. ' Though thou shouldst bray a fool <lb/>
            in the mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness <lb/>
            depart from him.' Proverbs, xxvii. 22. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Ellebore was a medicine used in madness. Horace says, Sat. ii. <lb/>

          <p>WHERE is the good? In the will.1 Where is the evil? <lb/>
            In the will. Where is neither of them ? In those things <lb/>
            which are independent of the will. Well then? Does <lb/>
            any one among us think of these lessons out of the schools ? <lb/>
            Does any one meditate (strive) by himself to give an <lb/>
            answer to things 2 as in the case of questions ? Is it <lb/>
            day ?—Yes.—Is it night ?-No.-Well, is the number of <lb/>
            stars even ? 3—I cannot say.-When money is shown <lb/>
            (offered) to you, have you studied to make the proper <lb/>
            answer, that money is not a good thing ? Have you prac­ <lb/>
            tised yourself in these answers, or only against sophisms ? <lb/>
            Why do you wonder then if in the cases which you have <lb/>
            studied, in those you have improved; but in those which you <lb/>
            have not studied, in those you remain the same ? When the <lb/>
            rhetorician knows that he has written well, that he has <lb/>
            committed to memory what he has written, and brings an <lb/>
            agreeable voice, why is he still anxious ? Because he is <lb/>
            not satisfied with having studied. What then does he <lb/>
            want? To be praised by the audience? For the purpose <lb/>
            then of being able to practise declamation he has been <lb/>
            disciplined ; but with respect to praise and blame he has <lb/>
            not been disciplined. For when did he hear from any one <lb/>
            what praise is, what blame is, what the nature of each is, <lb/>
            what kind of praise should be sought, or what kind of <lb/>
            blame should be shunned ? And when did he practise this <lb/>
            discipline which follows these words (things) ? 4 Why <lb/>
            then do you still wonder, if in the matters which a man <lb/>
            has learned, there he surpasses others, and in those in <note type="footnote"> 1 See ii. 10. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 'To answer to things' means to act in a way suitable to circum­ <lb/>

            which he has not been disciplined, there he is the same <lb/>
            with the many. So the lute player knows how to play, <lb/>
            sings well, and has a fine dress, and yet he trembles when <lb/>
            he enters on the stage ; for these matters he understands, <lb/>
            but be does not know what a crowd is, nor the shouts of a <lb/>
            crowd, nor what ridicule is. Neither does he know what <lb/>
            anxiety is, whether it is our work or the work of another, <lb/>
            whether it is possible to stop it or not. For this reason if <lb/>
            he has been praised, he leaves the theatre puffed up, but if <lb/>
            he has been ridiculed, the swollen bladder has been punc­ <lb/>
            tured and subsides.</p>
          <p>This is the case also with ourselves. What do we <lb/>
            admire? Externals. About what things are we busy? <lb/>
            Externals. And have we any doubt then why we fear or <lb/>
            why we are anxious ? What then happens when we think <lb/>
            the things, which are coming on us, to be evils? It is not <lb/>
            in our power not to be afraid, it is not in our power not to <lb/>
            be anxious. Then we say, Lord God, how shall I not be <lb/>
            anxious ? Fool, have you not hands, did not God make <lb/>
            them for you ? Sit down now and pray that your nose may <lb/>
            not run.5 Wipe yourself rather and do not blame him. Well <lb/>
            then, has he given to you nothing in the present case ? <lb/>
            Has he not given to you endurance ? has he not given to <lb/>
            you magnanimity? has he not given to you manliness? <lb/>
            When you have such hands, do you still look for one who <lb/>
            shall wipe your nose ? But we neither study these things <lb/>
            nor care for them. Give me a man who cares how he <lb/>
            shall do any thing, not for the obtaining of a thing, but <lb/>
            who cares about his own energy. What man, when he is <lb/>
            walking about, cares for his own energy ? who, when he <lb/>
            is deliberating, cares about his own deliberation, and not <lb/>
            about obtaining that about which he deliberates? And <lb/>
            if he succeeds, he is elated and says, How well we have <lb/>
            deliberated; did I not tell you, brother, that it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible, when we have thought about any thing, that it <lb/>
            should not turn out thus ? But if the thing should turn <lb/>
            out otherwise, the wretched man is humbled; he knows <lb/>
            not even what to say about what has taken place. Who <note type="footnote"> 5 By the words 'Sit down' Epictetus indicates the man's baseness and <lb/>

            The Apostles speak a very different language in their epistles to the <lb/>
            first converts of Christianity: and the Acts of the Apostles, and all the <lb/>
            monuments of the primitive ages bear testimony to the reformation of <lb/>
            manners produced by the Gospel. This difference of success might <lb/>
            indeed justly be expected from the difference of the two systems.' Mrs. <lb/>
            Carter.—I have not quoted this note of Mrs. Carter, because I think <lb/>
            that it is true. We do not know what was the effect of the teaching of <lb/>
            Epictetus, unless this passage informs us, if Mrs. Carter has drawn a <lb/>
            right inference from it. The language of Paul to the Corinthians is not <lb/>
            very different from that of Epictetus, and he speaks very unfavourably <lb/>
            of some of his Corinthian converts. We may allow that " a reformation <lb/>
            of manners was produced by the Gospel" in many of the converts to <lb/>
            Christianity, but there is no evidence that this reformation was pro­ <lb/>
            duced in all; and there is evidence that it was not. The corruptions in <lb/>
            the early Christian church and in subsequent ages are a proof that the <lb/>
            reforms made by the Gospel were neither universal nor permanent; and <lb/>
            this is the result which our knowledge of human nature would lead us <lb/>

            are. For instance as to myself, when I am on<unclear/> <lb/>
            and look down on the deep sea, or look round <lb/>
            see no land, I am out of my mind and imagine <unclear/> <lb/>

          <p>What then are the things which are heavy on us and <lb/>
            disturb us? What else than opinions? What else than <lb/>
            opinions lies heavy upon him who goes away and leaves <lb/>
            his companions and friends and places and habits of life? <lb/>
            Now little children, for instance, when they cry on the <lb/>
            nurse leaving them for a short time, forget their sorrow if <lb/>
            they receive a small cake. Do you choose then that we <lb/>
            should compare you to little children?-No, by Zeus, for <lb/>
            I do not wish to be pacified by a small cake, but by right <lb/>
            opinions.—And what are these ? Such as a man ought to <lb/>
            study all day, and not to be affected by any thing that is <lb/>
            not his own, neither by companion nor place nor gym­ <lb/>
            nasia, and not even by his own body, but to remember the <lb/>
            law and to have it before his eyes. And what is the <lb/>
            divine law? To keep a man's own, not to claim that <lb/>
            which belongs to others, but to use what is given, and <lb/>
            when it is not given, not to desire it; and when a thing <lb/>
            is taken away, to give it up readily and immediately, and <lb/>
            to be thankful for the time that a man has had the use of <lb/>
            it, if you would not cry for your nurse and mamma. For <lb/>
            what matter does it make by what thing a man is sub­ <lb/>
            dued, and on what he depends ? In what respect are you <lb/>
            better than he who cries for a girl, if you grieve for a <lb/>
            little gymnasium, and little porticoes and young men and <lb/>
            such places of amusement ? Another comes and laments <lb/>
            that he shall no longer drink the water of Dirce. Is the <lb/>

            to leave the sun itself and the moon, what will you do ? <lb/>
            will you sit and weep like children? Well, what have <lb/>
            you been doing in the school? what did you hear, what <lb/>
            did you learn ? why did you write yourself a philosopher, <lb/>
            when you might have written the truth; as, " I made <lb/>
            certain introductions, 11 and I read Chrysippus, but I did <lb/>
            not even approach the door of a philosopher." For how <lb/>
            should 112 possess any thing of the kind which Socrates <lb/>
            possessed, who died as he did, who lived as he did, or any <lb/>
            thing such as Diogenes possessed? Do you think that <lb/>
            any one of such men wept or grieved, because he was not <lb/>
            going to see a certain man, or a certain woman, nor to be <lb/>
            in Athens or in Corinth, but, if it should so happen, in <lb/>
            Susa or in Ecbatana ? For if a man can quit the banquet <lb/>
            when he chooses, and no longer amuse himself, does he <lb/>
            still stay and complain, and does he not stay, as at any <lb/>
            amusement, only so long as he is pleased ? Such a man, I <lb/>

          <p>WHAT is the first business of him who philosophizes? To <lb/>
            throw away self-conceit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴησις</foreign>).1 For it is impossible for <lb/>
            a man to begin to learn that which he thinks that be <lb/>
            knows. As to things then which ought to be done and <lb/>
            ought not to be done, and good and bad, and beautiful <lb/>
            and ugly, all of us talking of them at random go to the <lb/>
            philosophers; and on these matters we praise, we censure, <lb/>
            we accuse, we blame, we judge and determine about prin­ <lb/>
            ciples honourable and dishonourable. But why do we go <lb/>
            to the philosophers ? Because we wish to learn what we do <lb/>
            not think that we know. And what is this ? Theorems.2 <lb/>
            For we wish to learn what philosophers say as being <lb/>
            something elegant and acute; and some wish to learn that <note type="footnote"> 16 Procrustes and Sciron, two robbers who infested Attics and were <lb/>

            they may get profit from what they learn. It is ridiculous <lb/>
            then to think that a person wishes to learn one thing, and <lb/>
            will learn another; or further, that a man will make pro­ <lb/>
            ficiency in that which he does not learn. But the many <lb/>
            are deceived by this which deceived also the rhetorician <lb/>
            Theopompus,3 when he blames even Plato for wishing <lb/>
            everything to be defined. For what does he say? Did <lb/>
            none of us before you use the words Good or Just, or do <lb/>
            we utter the sounds in an unmeaning and empty way <lb/>
            without understanding what they severally signify ? Now <lb/>
            who tells you, Theopompus, that we had not natural <lb/>
            notions of each of these things and preconceptions (7rpo­ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λήψεις</foreign>) ? But it is not possible to adapt preconceptions <lb/>
            to their correspondent objects if we have not distinguished <lb/>
            (analyzed) them, and inquired what object must be sub­ <lb/>
            jected to each preconception. You may make the same <lb/>
            charge against physicians also. For who among us did <lb/>
            not use the words healthy and unhealthy before Hippo­ <lb/>
            crates lived, or did we utter these words as empty sounds ? <lb/>
            For we have also a certain preconception of health,. but <lb/>
            we are not able to adapt it. For this reason one says, <lb/>
            abstain from food; another says, give food; another <lb/>
            says, bleed ; and another says, use cupping. What is the <lb/>
            reason? is it any other than that a man cannot properly <lb/>
            adapt the preconception of health to particulars?</p>
          <p>So it is in this matter also, in the things which concern <lb/>
            life. Who among us does not speak of good and bad, of <lb/>
            useful and not useful; for who among us has not a pre­ <lb/>
            conception of each of these things ? Is it then a distinct <lb/>
            and perfect preconception ? Show this. How shall I show <lb/>
            this? Adapt the preconception properly to the particular <lb/>
            things. Plato, for instance, subjects definitions to the <lb/>
            preconception of the useful, but you to the preconception <lb/>
            of the useless. Is it possible then that both of you are <note type="footnote"> 3 This rhetorician or orator, as Epictetus names him, appears to be <lb/>

            right ? How is it possible? Does not one man adapt <lb/>
            the preconception of good to the matter of wealth, and <lb/>
            another not to wealth, but to the matter of pleasure and to <lb/>
            that of health ? For, generally, if all of us who use those <lb/>
            words know sufficiently each of them, and need no dili­ <lb/>
            gence in resolving (making distinct) the notions of the <lb/>
            preconceptions, why do we differ, why do we quarrel, why <lb/>
            do we blame one another ?</p>
          <p>And why do I now allege this contention with one an­ <lb/>
            other and speak of it? If you yourself properly adapt your <lb/>
            preconceptions, why are you unhappy, why are you hin­ <lb/>
            dered ? Let us omit at present the second topic about the <lb/>
            pursuits (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρμας</foreign>) and the study of the duties which relate to <lb/>
            them. Let us omit also the third topic, which relates to the <lb/>
            assents (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συγκαταθέσεις</foreign>) : I give up to you these two topics. <lb/>
            Let us insist upon the first, which presents an almost <lb/>
            obvious demonstration that wo do not properly adapt tho <lb/>
            preconceptions.5 Do you now desire that which is possible <lb/>
            and that which is possible to you? Why then are you <lb/>
            hindered ? why are you unhappy ? Do you not now try <lb/>
            to avoid the unavoidable ? Why then do you fall in with <lb/>
            any thing which you would avoid ? Why are you unfor­ <lb/>
            tunate ? Why, when you desire a thing, does it not happen, <lb/>
            and, when you do not desire it, does it happen? For this <lb/>
            is the greatest proof of unhappiness and misery: I wish <lb/>
            for something, and it does not happen. And what is more <lb/>
            wretched than I ?6</p>
          <p>It was because she could not endure this that Medea <lb/>
            came to murder her children: an act of a noble spirit in <lb/>
            this view at least, for she had a just opinion what it is <lb/>
            for a thing not to succeed which a person wishes. Then <lb/>
            she says, ' Thus I shall be avenged on him (my husband) <lb/>
            who has wronged and insulted me ; and what shall I gain <lb/>
            if he is punished thus? how then shall it be done? I <lb/>
            shall kill my children, but I shall punish myself also : <lb/>
            and what do I care?'7 This is the aberration of soul <lb/>
            which possesses great energy. For she did not know <note type="footnote"> I The topic of the desires and aversions.

            wherein lies the doing of that which wo wish; that you <lb/>
            cannot get this from without, nor yet by the alteration <lb/>
            and new adaptation of things. Do not desire the man <lb/>
            (Jason, Medea's husband), and nothing which you desire <lb/>
            will fail to happen: do not obstinately desire that he <lb/>
            shall live with you: do not desire to remain in Cerinth; <lb/>
            and in a word desire nothing than that which God wills.- <lb/>
            And who shall hinder you ? who shall compel you ? No <lb/>
            man shall compel you any more than he shall compel Zeus.</p>
          <p>When you have such a guide8 and your wishes and <lb/>
            desires are the same as his, why do you still fear dis­ <lb/>
            appointment? Give up your desire to wealth and your <lb/>
            aversion to poverty, and you will be disappointed in the <lb/>
            one, you will fall into the other. Well give them up <lb/>
            to health, and you will be unfortunate : give them up to <lb/>
            magistracies, honours, country, friends, children, in a word <lb/>
            to any of the things which are not in man's power (and <lb/>
            you will be unfortunate). But give them up to Zeus <lb/>
            and to the rest of the gods; surrender them to the gods, <lb/>
            let the gods govern, let your desire and aversion be ranged <lb/>
            on the side of the gods, and wherein will you be any <lb/>
            longer unhappy?9 But if, lazy wretch, you envy, and <lb/>
            complain, and are jealous, and fear, and never cease for <lb/>
            a single day complaining both of yourself and of the gods, <lb/>
            why do you still speak of being educated? What kind <lb/>
            of an education, man ? Do you mean that you have been <lb/>
            employed about sophistical syllogisms (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭυλλογϭὺς μετα­ <lb/>
            πίπτοντας</foreign> ?10 Will you not, if it is possible, unlearn all <lb/>
            these things and begin from the beginning, and see at <lb/>
            the same time that hitherto you have not even touched the <lb/>
            matter; and then commencing from this foundation, will <lb/>
            you not build up all that comes after, so that nothing may <lb/>
            happen which you do not choose, and nothing shall fail <lb/>
            to happen which you do choose ?</p>
          <p>Give me one young man who has come to the school <lb/>
            with this intention, who is become a champion for this <lb/>

            enough for me if it shall ever be in my power to pass my <lb/>
            life free from hindrance and free from trouble, and to stretch <lb/>
            out (present) my neck to all things like a free man, and <lb/>

            the matter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τόπον</foreign>), let him come to me again and say, <lb/>
            ' I desire to be free from passion and free from pertur­ <lb/>
            bation ; and I wish as a pious man and a philosopher and <lb/>
            a diligent person to know what is my duty to the gods, <lb/>
            what to my parents, what to my brothers, what to my <lb/>

            second matter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τόπον</foreign>): this also is yours.'—' But I have <lb/>
            now sufficiently studied the second part (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τόπον</foreign>) also, and <lb/>

            I am awake, but also when I am asleep, and when I am <lb/>

            what good will it do you ? You will read the whole with <lb/>

            Then having told your dreams to one another you return <lb/>
            to the same things: your desires are the same, your <lb/>
            aversions the same, your pursuits are the same, and your <lb/>
            designs and purposes, you wish for the same things and <lb/>
            work for the same. In the next place you do not even <lb/>
            seek for one to give you advice, but you are vexed if you <lb/>
            hear such things (as I say). Then you say, " An ill-na­ <lb/>

            and attempt to make a long walk, and you will see how <lb/>
            your legs are weakened. Generally then if you would <lb/>
            make any thing a habit, do it; if you would not make it <lb/>
            a habit, do not do it, but accustom yourself to do something <lb/>
            else in place of it.</p>
          <p>So it is with respect to the affections of the soul: when <lb/>
            you have been angry, you must know that not only has <lb/>
            this evil befallen you, but that you have also increased the <lb/>
            habit, and in a manner thrown fuel upon fire. When you <lb/>
            have been overcome in sexual intercourse with a person, <lb/>
            do not reckon this single defeat only, but reckon that you <lb/>
            have also nurtured, increased your incontinence. For it <lb/>
            is impossible for habits and faculties, some of them not to <lb/>
            be produced, when they did not exist before, and others <lb/>
            not be increased and strengthened by corresponding acts.</p>
          <p>In this manner certainly, as philosophers say, also dis­ <lb/>
            eases of the mind grow up.2 For when you have once <lb/>
            desired money, if reason be applied to lead to a per­ <lb/>
            ception of the evil, the desire is stopped, and the ruling <lb/>
            faculty of our mind is restored to the original authority. <lb/>
            But if you apply no means of cure, it no longer returns to <lb/>
            the same state, but being again excited by the correspond­ <lb/>
            ing appearance, it is inflamed to desire quicker than be­ <lb/>

            forth hardened (made callous), and the disease of the mind <lb/>
            confirms the love of money. For he who has had a fever, <lb/>
            and has been relieved from it, is not in the same state <lb/>
            that he was before, unless he has been completely cured. <lb/>
            Something of the kind happens also in diseases of the soul. <lb/>
            Certain traces and blisters are left in it, and unless a man <lb/>
            shall completely efface them, when he is again lashed on <lb/>
            the same places, the lash will produce not blisters (weals) <lb/>
            but sores. If then you wish not to be of an angry temper, <lb/>
            do not feed the habit: throw nothing on it which will <lb/>
            increase it: at first keep quiet, and count the days on <lb/>
            which you have not been angry. I used to be in passion <lb/>
            every day; now every second day; then every third, then <lb/>
            every fourth. But if you have intermitted thirty days, <lb/>
            make a sacrifice to God. For the habit at first begins to <note type="footnote"> a <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀῤῥωϭτήματα</foreign>. ' Aegrotationes quae appellantur a Stoicia <lb/>

            succeeding day during two or three months; but I took <lb/>
            care when some exciting things happened." Be assured <lb/>
            that you are in a good way.3 To-day when I saw a <lb/>
            handsome person, I did not say to myself, I wish I could <lb/>
            lie with her, and Happy is her husband; for he who says <lb/>
            this says, Happy is her adulterer also. Nor do I picture <lb/>
            the rest to my mind; the woman present, and stripping <lb/>
            herself and lying down by my side. I stroke my head <lb/>
            and say, Well done, Epictetus, you have solved a fine little <lb/>
            sophism, much finer than that which is called the master <lb/>
            sophism. And if even the woman is willing, and gives <lb/>
            signs, and sends messages, and if she also fondle me and <lb/>
            come close to me, and I should abstain and be victorious, <lb/>
            that would be a sophism beyond that which is named the <lb/>
            Liar, and the Quiescent.4 Over such a victory as this a <lb/>
            man may justly be proud; not for proposing the master <lb/>
            sophism.</p>
          <p>How then shall this be done ? Be willing at length to <lb/>
            be approved by yourself, be willing to appear beautiful <lb/>
            to God, desire to be in purity with your own pure self <lb/>
            and with God. Then when any such appearance visits <lb/>
            you, Plato says,6 Have recourse to expiations, go a sup­ <lb/>
            pliant to the temples of the averting deities. It is even <lb/>
            sufficient if you resort to the society of noble and just <lb/>
            men, and compare yourself with them, whether you find <lb/>
            one who is living or dead. Go to Socrates and see him <lb/>

          <p>THE argument called the ruling argument (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ κυριεύων <lb/>
            λόγος</foreign>)2 appears to have been proposed from such prin­ <lb/>
            ciples as these: there is in fact a common contradiction <lb/>
            between one another in these three propositions, each two <lb/>
            being in contradiction to the third. The propositions are, <lb/>
            that every thing past must of necessity be true; that an <lb/>
            impossibility does not follow a possibility; and that a thing <lb/>
            is possible which neither is nor will be true. Diodorus3 <lb/>
            observing this contradiction employed the probative force <lb/>
            of the first two for the demonstration of this proposition, <lb/>

            be. Now another will hold these two : That something is <lb/>
            possible, which is neither true nor ever will be : and That <lb/>
            an impossibility does not follow a possibility. But he <lb/>
            will not allow that every thing which is past is necessarily <lb/>
            true, as the followers of Cleanthes seem to think, and <lb/>
            Antipater copiously defended them. But others maintain <lb/>
            the other two propositions, That a thing is possible which <lb/>
            is neither true nor will be true: and That everything <lb/>
            which is past is necessarily true; but then they will <lb/>
            maintain that an impossibility can follow a possibility. <lb/>
            But it is impossible to maintain these three propositions, <lb/>
            because of their common contradiction.4</p>
          <p>If then any man should ask me, which of these propo­ <lb/>
            sitions do you maintain? I will answer him, that I do <lb/>
            not know; but I have received this story, that Diodorus <lb/>
            maintained one opinion, the followers of Panthoides, I <lb/>
            think, and Cleanthes maintained another opinion, and <lb/>
            those of Cbrysippus a third. What then is your opinion ? <lb/>
            I was not made for this purpose, to examine the appear­ <lb/>
            ances that occur to me, and to compare what others say <lb/>
            and to form an opinion of my own on the thing. Therefore <lb/>
            I differ not at all from the grammarian. Who was Hector's <lb/>
            father ? Priam. Who were his brothers ? Alexander and <lb/>
            Deiphobus. Who was their mother? Hecuba. — I have <lb/>
            heard this story. From whom ? From Homer. And Hel­ <lb/>
            lanicus also, I think, writes about the same things, and <lb/>
            perhaps others like him. And what further have I about <lb/>
            the ruling argument? Nothing. But, if I am a vain <lb/>
            man, especially at a banquet 1 surprise the guests by <lb/>
            enumerating those who have written on these matters. <lb/>
            Both Chrysippus has written wonderfully in his first book <lb/>
            about Possibilities, and Cleanthes has written specially on <lb/>
            the subject, and Archedemus. Antipater also has written <lb/>
            not only in his work about Possibilities, but also separately <lb/>
            in his work on the ruling argument. Have you not read <lb/>
            the work ? I have not read it. Read. And what profit <lb/>
            will 'a man have from it ? he will be more trifling and <lb/>
            impertinent than he is now; for what else have you <lb/>
            gained by reading it ? What opinion have you formed on <note type="footnote"> 4 If you assume any two of these three, they must be in contradiction <lb/>

            this subject? none; but you will tell us of Helen and <lb/>
            Priam, and the island of Calypso which never was and <lb/>
            never will be. And in this matter indeed it is of no great <lb/>
            importance if you retain the story, but have formed no <lb/>
            opinion of your own. But in matters of morality (Ethic) <lb/>
            this happens to us much more than in these things of <lb/>
            which we are speaking. <lb/>
            Speak to me about good and evil. Listen: <lb/>

          <p>Of things some are good, some are bad, and others are <lb/>
            indifferent. The good then are the virtues and the things <lb/>
            which partake of the virtues: the bad are the vices, and <lb/>
            the things which partake of them; and the indifferent are <lb/>
            the things which lie between the virtues and the vices, <lb/>
            wealth, health, life, death, pleasure, pain. Whence do you <lb/>
            know this ? Hellanicus says it in his Egyptian history; <lb/>
            for what difference does it make to say this, or to say that <lb/>
            Diogenes has it in his Ethic, or Chrysippus or Cleanthes ? <lb/>
            Have you then examined any of these things and formed <lb/>
            an opinion of your own? Show how you are used to <lb/>
            behave in a storm on shipboard ? Do you remember this <lb/>

            Odyssey, the first which occurs to him, and says, Listen. There is <lb/>
            nothing to listen to, but it is as good for the hearer as any thing else. <lb/>
            Then he utters some philosophical principles, and being asked where <lb/>
            he learned them, he says, from Hellanicus, who was an historian, not <lb/>
            a philosopher. He is bantering the hearer: it makes no matter from <lb/>
            what author I learned them; it is all the same. The real question is, <lb/>
            have you examined what Good and Evil are, and have you formed an <lb/>

            to mock us? But if Caesar send for you to answer a <lb/>

            are going in pale and trembling, a person should come up <lb/>
            to you and say, Why do you tremble, man ? what is the <lb/>
            matter about which you are engaged ? Does Caesar who <lb/>
            sits within give virtue and vice to those who go in to <lb/>
            him? You reply, Why do you also mock me and add <lb/>
            to my present sorrows ?-Still tell me, philosopher, tell <lb/>
            me why you tremble? Is it not death of which yon run <lb/>
            the risk, or a prison, or pain of the body, or banishment, <lb/>
            or disgrace ? What else is there ? Is there any vice or <lb/>
            anything which partakes of vice ? What then did you <lb/>
            use to say of these things ?—' What have you to do with <lb/>
            me, man ? my own evils are enough for me.' And you <lb/>
            say right. Your own evils are enough for you, your <lb/>
            baseness, your cowardice, your boasting which you showed <lb/>
            when you sat in the school. Why did you decorate yourself <lb/>

          <p>Observe yourselves thus in your actions, and you will <lb/>
            find to what sect you belong. You will find that most of <lb/>
            you are Epicureans, a few Peripatetics,6 and those feeble. <lb/>
            For wherein will you show that you really consider virtue <lb/>
            equal to everything else or even superior ? But show me <lb/>
            a Stoic, if you can. Where or how? But you can show <lb/>
            me an endless number who utter small arguments of the <lb/>
            Stoics. For do the same persons repeat the Epicurean <lb/>
            opinions any worse ? And the Peripatetic, do they not <lb/>
            handle them also with equal accuracy? who then is a <lb/>
            Stoic ? As we call a statue Phidiac, which is fashioned <lb/>
            according to the art of Phidias; so show me a man who <lb/>
            is fashioned according to the doctrines which he utters. <lb/>

            prosperous, happy, looking to God in everything small <lb/>
            and great. And you are here to learn and practise these <lb/>
            things. Why then do you not finish the work, if you also <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE propositions which are true and evident are of neces­ <lb/>
            sity used even by those who contradict them : and a man <lb/>
            might perhaps consider it to be the greatest proof of a <lb/>
            thing being evident that it is found to be necessary even <lb/>
            for him who denies it to make use of it at the same time. <lb/>
            For instance, if a man should deny that there is anything <lb/>
            universally true, it is plain that he must make the contra­ <lb/>
            dictory negation, that nothing is universally true. What, <lb/>
            wretch, do you not admit even this? For what else is <lb/>
            this than to affirm that whatever is universally affirmed <lb/>
            is false ? Again if a man should come forward and say: <lb/>
            Know that there is nothing that can be known,1 but all <lb/>
            things are incapable of sure evidence; or if another say, <lb/>
            Believe me and you will bo the better for it, that a man <note type="footnote"> 1 'Itaque Arcesilas negabat esse quidquam quod sciri posset, no <lb/>
            illud quidem ipsum, quud Socrates sibi reliquisset, Sio omnia latere <lb/>
            censebat in occulto, neque esse quidquam quod cerni aut intelligi <lb/>
            possit. Quibus de causis nihil oportere neque profiteri neque adfirmare <lb/>
            quemquam neque adsensione adprobare.' Cicero. Academ. Post. 1.12, <lb/>

            ought not to believe any thing; or again, if another should <lb/>
            say, Learn from me, man, that it is not possible to learn <lb/>
            any thing; I tell you this and will teach you, if you choose. <lb/>
            Now in what respect do these differ from those ? Whom <lb/>
            shall I name? Those who call themselves Academies? <lb/>
            * Men, agree [with us] that no man agrees [ with another] : <lb/>
            believe us that no man believes anybody.'</p>
          <p>Thus Epicurus2 also, when he designs to destroy the <lb/>
            natural fellowship of mankind, at the same time makes use <lb/>
            of that which he destroys. For what does he say ? ' Be <lb/>
            not deceived, men, nor be led astray, nor be mistaken: <lb/>
            there is no natural fellowship among rational animals; <lb/>
            believe me. But those who say otherwise, deceive you <lb/>
            and seduce you by false reasons.'—What is this to you ? <lb/>
            Permit -its to be deceived. Will you fare worse, if all the <lb/>
            rest of us are persuaded that there is a natural fellowship <lb/>
            among us, and that it ought by all means to be preserved? <lb/>
            Nay, it will be much better and safer for you. Man, why do <lb/>
            you trouble yourself about us ? Why do you keep awake <lb/>
            for us ? Why do you light your lamp ? Why do you rise <lb/>
            early ? Why do you write so many books, that no one of <lb/>
            us may be deceived about the gods and believe that they <lb/>
            take care of men; or that no one may suppose the nature <lb/>
            of good to be other than pleasure ? For if this is so, lie <lb/>
            down and sleep, and lead the life of a worm, of which you <lb/>
            judged yourself worthy : eat and drink, and enjoy women, <lb/>
            and ease yourself, and snored And what is it to you, how <lb/>
            the rest shall think about these things, whether right or <lb/>
            wrong ? For what have we to do with you ? You take <lb/>
            care of sheep because they supply us with wool and milk, <lb/>
            and last of all with their flesh. Would it not be a desirable <note type="footnote"> 2 Cicero, do Fin. ii. 30. 31, speaking of the letter, which Epicurus <lb/>
            wrote to Hermarchus when he was dying, says ' that the actions of <lb/>
            Epicurus were inconsistent with his sayings,' and ' his writings were <lb/>
            confuted by his probity and morality.' </note><note type="footnote"> a Paul says, Cor. i. 15.32: ' If after the manner of men I have fought <lb/>

            let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.' The words ' let us eat <lb/>
            and drink, etc.' are said to be a quotation from the Thais of Menander. <lb/>
            The meaning seems to be, that if I do not believe in the resurrection of <lb/>
            the dead, why should I not enjoy the sensual pleasures of life only? <lb/>
            This is not the doctrine of Epictetus, as wo see in the text. </note> <lb/>

            thing if men could be lulled and enchanted by the Stoics, <lb/>
            and sleep and present themselves to you and to those like <lb/>
            you to be shorn and milked ? For this you ought to say to <lb/>
            your brother Epicureans: but ought you not to conceal it <lb/>
            from others, and particularly before every thing to persuade <lb/>
            them, that we are by nature adapted for fellowship, that <lb/>
            temperance is a good thing; in order that all things may <lb/>
            be secured for you ?4 Or ought we to maintain this fellow­ <lb/>
            ship with some and not with others? With whom then <lb/>
            ought we to maintain it ? With such as on their part also <lb/>
            maintain it, or with such as violate this fellowship ? And <lb/>
            who violate it more than you who establish such doctrines ?</p>
          <p>What then was it that waked Epicurus from his sleepi­ <lb/>
            ness, and compelled him to write what he did write? <lb/>
            What else was it than that which is the strongest thing <lb/>
            in men, nature, which draws a man to her own will though <lb/>
            he be unwilling and complaining? For since, she says, <lb/>
            you think that there is no community among mankind, <lb/>
            write this opinion and leave it for others, and break your <lb/>
            sleep to do this, and by your own practice condemn your own <lb/>
            opinions. Shall we then say that Orestes was agitated by <lb/>
            the Erinyes (Furies) and roused from his deep sleep, and <lb/>
            did not more savage Erinyes and Pains rouse Epicurus <lb/>
            from his sleep and not allow him to rest, but compelled <lb/>
            him to make known his own evils, as madness and wine <lb/>
            did the Galli (the priests of Cybele)? So strong and in­ <lb/>
            vincible is man's nature, For how can a vine be moved <lb/>
            not in the manner of a vine, but in the manner of an <lb/>
            olive tree ? or on the other hand how can an olive tree be <lb/>
            moved not in the manner of an olive tree, but in the <lb/>
            manner of a vine ? It is impossible: it cannot be con­ <lb/>
            ceived. Neither then is it possible for a man completely <lb/>
            to lose the movements (affects) of a man ; and even those <lb/>
            who are deprived of their genital members are not able to <lb/>
            deprive themselves of man's desires.5 Thus Epicurus also <lb/>
            mutilated all the offices of a man, and of a father of a <lb/>
            family, and of a citizen and of a friend, but he did not <note type="footnote"> 4 It would give security to the Epicureans, that they would enjoy <lb/>
            all that they value, if other men should be persuaded that we are <lb/>

            does not strive to add to these measures and rules and to <lb/>
            improve 6 them, but just the contrary, endeavours to take <lb/>

            that they are good things. Well, demonstrate it, that our <lb/>

            thankful.-Since then you are well pleased with them, hear <lb/>
            the contrary : That there are no Gods, and, if there are, they <lb/>
            take no care of men, nor is there any fellowship between <lb/>
            its and them; and that this piety and sanctity which is <lb/>
            talked of among most men is the lying of boasters and <lb/>
            sophists, or certainly of legislators for the purpose of <lb/>
            terrifying and checking wrong doers.7—Well done, philo­ <lb/>
            sopher, you have done something for our citizens, you have <lb/>
            brought back all the young men to contempt of things <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>SoME things men readily confess, and other things they do <lb/>
            not. No one then will confess that he is a fool or without <lb/>
            understanding; but quite the contrary you will hear all <lb/>
            men saying, I wish that I had fortune equal to my under­ <lb/>
            standing. But men readily confess that they are timid, <lb/>
            and they say: I am rather timid, I confess; but as to <lb/>
            other respects you will not find me to be foolish. A mail <lb/>
            will not readily confess that he is intemperate; and that <lb/>
            he is unjust, he will not confess at all. He will by no <lb/>
            means confess that he is envious or a busy body. Most <lb/>
            men will confess that they are compassionate. What <lb/>
            then is the reason ?-The chief thing (the ruling thing) <lb/>
            is inconsistency and confusion in the things which relate <lb/>
            to good and evil. But different men have different reasons; <lb/>
            and generally what they imagine to be base, they do not <lb/>
            confess at all. But they suppose timidity to be a charac­ <lb/>
            teristic of a good disposition, and compassion also; but <lb/>
            silliness to be the absolute characteristic of a slave. And <lb/>
            they do not at all admit (confess) the things which are <lb/>
            offences against society. But in the case of most errors <lb/>
            for this reason chiefly they are induced to confess them, <lb/>
            because they imagine that there is something involuntary <lb/>
            in them as in timidity and compassion; and if a man <lb/>
            confess that he is in any respect intemperate, he alleges <lb/>
            love (or passion) as an excuse for what is involuntary. <lb/>
            But men do not imagine injustice to be at all involuntary. <lb/>
            There is also in jealousy, as they suppose, something in­ <lb/>
            voluntary; and for this reason they confess to jealousy <lb/>
            also.</p>
          <p>Living then among such men, who are so confused, so <lb/>
            ignorant of what they say, and of the evils which they <lb/>
            have or have not, and why they have them, or how they <lb/>
            shall be relieved of them, I think it is worth the trouble <note type="footnote"> 1 Schweig. has some remarks on the title of this chapter. He says. <lb/>
            4 that this discourse does not keep to the same subject, but proceeds <lb/>
            from that with which it began to other things.' </note> <lb/>

            for a man to watch constantly (and to ask) whether I also <lb/>
            am one of them, what imagination I have about myself, <lb/>
            how I conduct myself, whether I conduct myself as a <lb/>
            prudent man, whether I conduct myself as a temperate <lb/>
            man, whether I ever say this, that I have been taught to <lb/>
            be prepared for every thing that may happen. Have I <lb/>
            the consciousness, which a man who knows nothing ought <lb/>
            to have, that I know nothing? Do I go to my teacher as <lb/>
            men go to oracles, prepared to obey? or do I like a snivel­ <lb/>
            ling boy go to my school to learn history and understand <lb/>
            the books which I did not understand before, and, if it <lb/>
            should happen so, to explain them also to others ?—Man, <lb/>
            you have had a fight in the house with a poor slave, you <lb/>
            have turned the family upside down, you have frightened <lb/>
            the neighbours, and you come to me 2 as if you were a wise <lb/>
            man, and you take your seat and judge how I have ex­ <lb/>
            plained some word, and low I have babbled whatever <lb/>
            came into my head. You come full of envy, and humbled, <lb/>
            because you bring nothing from home; 3 and you sit <lb/>
            during the discussion thinking of nothing else than how <lb/>
            your father is disposed towards you and your brother. <lb/>
            ' What are they saying about me there ? now they think <lb/>
            that I am improving, and are saying, He will return with <lb/>
            all knowledge. I wish I could learn every thing before I <lb/>
            return: but much labour is necessary, and no one sends <lb/>
            me any thing, and the baths at Nicopolis are dirty; every <lb/>
            thing is bad at home, and bad here.'</p>
          <p>Then they say, no one gains any profit from the school. <lb/>
            -Why, who comes to the school? who comes for the <lb/>
            purpose of being improved? who comes to present his <lb/>
            opinions to be purified ? who comes to learn what he is in <lb/>
            want of? Why do you wonder then if you carry back <lb/>
            from the school the very things which you bring into it? <lb/>

            no means, nor any thing like it. You rather look to this, <lb/>
            whether you possess already that for which you come. <lb/>
            You wish to prattle about theorems ? What then ? Do you <lb/>
            not become greater triflers ? Do not your little theorems <lb/>
            give you some opportunity of display ? You solve sophis­ <lb/>
            tical syllogisms,4 Do you not examine the assumptions <lb/>
            of the syllogism named the Liar?5 Do you not examine <lb/>
            hypothetical syllogisms ? Why then are you still vexed if <lb/>
            you receive the things for which you come to the school ? <lb/>
            Yes; but if my child die or my brother, or if I must <lb/>
            die or be racked, what good will these things do me 6 ?— <lb/>
            Well, did you come for this ? for this do you sit by ray <lb/>
            side? did you ever for this light your lamp or keep <lb/>
            awake? or, when you went out to the walking place, <lb/>
            did you ever propose any appearance that had been pre­ <lb/>
            sented to you instead of a syllogism, and did you and your <lb/>
            friends discuss it together? Where and when? Then you <lb/>
            say, Theorems are useless. To whom ? To such as make <lb/>
            a bad use of them. For eye-salves are not useless to those <lb/>
            who use them as they ought and when they ought. <lb/>
            Fomentations are not useless. Dum-bells 7 arc not useless; <lb/>
            but they are useless to some, useful to others. If you ask <lb/>
            me now if syllogisms are useful, I will tell you that they <lb/>
            are useful, and if you choose, I will prove it.8—How then <lb/>
            will they in any way be useful to me ? Man, did you ask <lb/>
            if they are useful to you, or did you ask generally ? Let <lb/>
            him who is suffering from dysentery, ask me if vinegar is <lb/>
            useful; I will say that it is useful.- Will it then be useful <lb/>
            to me?—I will say, no. Seek first for the discharge to <lb/>
            be stopped and the ulcers to be closed. And do you, 0 <lb/>
            men, first cure the ulcers and stop the discharge; be tran­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WHAT a man applies himself to earnestly, that he natu­ <lb/>
            rally loves. Do men then apply themselves earnestly to <lb/>
            the things which are bad ? By no means. Well, do they <lb/>
            apply themselves to things which in no way concern <lb/>
            themselves? not to these either. It remains then that <lb/>
            they employ themselves earnestly only about things which <lb/>
            are good; and if they are earnestly employed about things, <lb/>
            they love such things also. Whoever then understands <lb/>
            what is good, can also know how to love: but he who <lb/>
            cannot distinguish good from bad, and things which are <lb/>
            neither good nor bad from both, how can he possess the <lb/>
            power of loving? To love then is only in the power of <lb/>
            the wise.</p>
          <p>How is this ? a man may say; I am foolish, and yet I <lb/>
            love my child.—I am surprised indeed that you have <lb/>
            begun by making the admission that you are foolish. For <lb/>
            what are you deficient in? Can you not make use of <lb/>
            your senses ? do you not distinguish appearances ? do you <lb/>
            not use food which is suitable for your body, and clothing <lb/>
            and habitation? Why then do you admit that you are <lb/>
            foolish ? It is in truth because you are often disturbed by <lb/>
            appearances and perplexed, and their power of persuasion <lb/>
            often conquers you; and sometimes you think these things <lb/>
            to be good, and then the same things to be bad, and lastly <lb/>
            neither good nor bad; and in short you grieve, fear, envy, <lb/>
            are disturbed, you are changed. This is the reason why <lb/>
            you confess that you are foolish. And are you not change­ <lb/>
            able in love? But wealth, and pleasure and in a word <note type="footnote"> 1 ' In this dissertation is expounded the Stoic principle that friend­ <lb/>

            expressed some of the opinions of Musonius Rufus (i. 1. note 12). <lb/>
            Schweig. draws this conclusion from certain words of Stobaeus; and he <lb/>

            things themselves, do you sometimes think them to be <lb/>
            good, and sometimes bad ? and do you not think the same <lb/>
            men at one time to be good, at another time bad? and <lb/>
            have you not at one time a friendly feeling towards them, <lb/>
            and at another time the feeling of an enemy ? and do you <lb/>
            not at one time praise them, and at another time blame <lb/>
            them? Yes; I have these feelings also. Well then, do <lb/>
            you think that he who has been deceived about a man is <lb/>
            his friend? Certainly not. And he who has selected a <lb/>
            man as his friend and is of a changeable disposition, has <lb/>
            he good will towards him? He has not. And he who <lb/>
            now abuses a man, and afterwards admires him ? This <lb/>
            man also has no good will to the other. Well then, did <lb/>
            you never see little dogs caressing and playing with one <lb/>
            another, so that you might say, there is nothing more <lb/>
            friendly? but that you may know what friendship is, <lb/>
            throw a bit of flesh among them, and you will learn. <lb/>
            Throw between yourself and your son a little estate, and <lb/>
            you will know how soon he will wish to bury you and <lb/>
            how soon you wish your son to die. Then you will change <lb/>
            your tone and say, what a son I have brought up! He <lb/>
            has long been wishing to bury me. Throw a smart girl <lb/>
            between you; and do you the old man love her, and the <lb/>
            young one will love her too. If a little fame intervene <lb/>
            or dangers, it will be just the same. You will utter the <lb/>
            words of the father of Admetus ! <lb/>
            Life gives you pleasure: and why not your father ?3</p>
          <p>Do you think that Admetus did not love his own child <lb/>
            when he was little ? that he was not in agony when the <lb/>
            child had a fever ? that he did not often say, I wish I had <lb/>
            the fever instead of the child ? then when the test (the <lb/>
            thing) came and was near, see what words they utter. <lb/>
            Were not Eteocles and Polynices from the same mother <lb/>
            and from the same father? Were they not brought up <lb/>
            together, had they not lived together, drunk together, <lb/>
            slept together, and often kissed one another ? So that, if <note type="footnote"> 2 The first verse is from the Alcestis of Euripides, v. 691. The second <lb/>
            in Epictetus is not in Euripides. Schweighaeuser thinks that it hall <lb/>

            any man, I think, had seen them, he would have ridiculed <lb/>
            the philosophers for the paradoxes which they utter about <lb/>
            friendship. But when a quarrel rose between them about <lb/>
            the royal power, as between dogs about a bit of meat, see <lb/>
            what they say <lb/>
            Polynices. Where will you take your station <lb/>
            before the towers? <lb/>
            Eteocles, Why do you ask me this? <lb/>
            Pol. I will place myself opposite and try to <lb/>
            kill you. <lb/>
            jEt. I also wish to do the same.3 <lb/>
            Such are the wishes that they utter.</p>
          <p>For universally, be not deceived, every animal is <lb/>
            attached to nothing so much as to its own interest.4 <lb/>
            Whatever then appears to it an impediment to this interest, <lb/>
            whether this be a brother, or a father, or a child, or <lb/>
            beloved, or lover, it hates, spurns, curses: for its nature is <lb/>
            to love nothing so much as its own interest; this is father, <lb/>
            and brother and kinsman, and country, and God. When <lb/>
            then the gods appear to us to be an impediment to this, <lb/>
            we abuse them and throw down their statues and burn <lb/>
            their temples, as Alexander ordered the temples of Aes­ <lb/>
            culapius to be burned when his dear friend died.5</p>
          <p>For this reason if a man put in the same place his <lb/>
            interest, sanctity, goodness, and country, and parents, and <lb/>
            friends, all these are secured : but if he puts in one place <lb/>
            his interest, in another his friends, and his country and <lb/>
            his kinsmen and justice itself, all these give way being <lb/>
            borne down by the weight of interest. For where the I <lb/>
            and the Mine are placed, to that place of necessity the <lb/>
            animal inclines: if in the flesh, there is the ruling power: <lb/>
            if in the will, it is there: and if it is in externals, it is <note type="footnote"> 3 From the Phoenissae of Euripides, v. 723, etc. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Compare Euripides, Hecuba, v. 846, etc4:— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              there.6 If then I am there where my will is, then only <lb/>
              shall I be a friend such as I ought to be, and son, and <lb/>
              father; for this will be my interest, to maintain the <lb/>
              character of fidelity, of modesty, of patience, of abstinence, <lb/>
              of active co-operation, of observing my relations (towards <lb/>
              all). But if I put myself in one place, and honesty in <lb/>
              another, then the doctrine of Epicurus becomes strong, <lb/>
              which asserts either that there is no honesty or it is that <lb/>
              which opinion holds to be honest (virtuous). 7</p>
          <p>It was through this ignorance that the Athenians and <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians quarrelled, and the Thebans with <lb/>
            both; and the great king quarrelled with Hellas, and the <lb/>
            Macedonians with both; and the Romans with the Getae,8 <lb/>
            And still earlier the Trojan war happened for these <lb/>
            reasons. Alexander was the guest of Menelaus; and if <lb/>
            any man had seen their friendly disposition, he would not <lb/>
            have believed any one who said that they were not friends. <lb/>
            But there was cast between them (as between dogs) a bit <lb/>
            of meat, a handsome woman, and about her war arose. <lb/>
            And now when you see brothers to be friends appearing to <lb/>
            have one mind, do not conclude from this any thing about <lb/>
            their friendship, not even if they swear it and say that it is <lb/>
            impossible for them to be separated from one another. For <note type="footnote"> 6 Matthew vi. 21,' for where your treasure is, there will your heart <lb/>

            disposition and behaviour): but how it is the interest of each <lb/>

            the ruling principle of a bad man cannot be trusted, it is <lb/>
            insecure, has no certain rule by which it is directed, and <lb/>
            is overpowered at different times by different appearances.9 <lb/>
            But examine, not what other men examine, if they are <lb/>
            born of the same parents and brought up together, and <lb/>
            under the same paedagogue; but examine this only, <lb/>
            wherein they place their interest, whether in externals or <lb/>
            in the will. If in externals, do not name them friends, no <lb/>
            more than name them trustworthy or constant, or brave <lb/>
            or free: do not name them even men, if you have any <lb/>
            judgment. For that is not a principle of human nature <lb/>
            which makes them bite one another, and abuse one another, <lb/>
            and occupy deserted places or public places, as if they <lb/>
            were mountains,10 and in the courts of justice display the <lb/>
            acts of robbers; nor yet that which makes them intem­ <lb/>
            perate and adulterers and corrupters, nor that which <lb/>
            makes them do whatever else men do against one another <lb/>
            through this one opinion only, that of placing themselves <lb/>
            and their interests in the things which are not within the <lb/>
            power of their will. But if you hear that in truth these <lb/>
            men think the good to be only there, where will is, and <lb/>
            where there is a right use of appearances, no longer <lb/>
            trouble yourself whether they are father or son, or <lb/>
            brothers, or have associated a long time and are com­ <lb/>

            dently declare that they are friends, as you declare that <lb/>
            they are faithful, that they are just. For where else is <lb/>
            friendship than where there is fidelity, and modesty, <lb/>

            It is the opinion about such things. That was the bestial <lb/>

            his friend, cut out these opinions, hate them, drive them from <lb/>

            his mind, he will not torture himself. In the next place, to <lb/>
            another also, who is like himself, he will be altogether and <lb/>

            Plato's doctrine that every mind is deprived of truth <lb/>

            together, and sail together, and you may be born of tho <lb/>

          <p>EVERY man will read a book with more pleasure or even <lb/>
            with more ease, if it is written in fairer characters. There­ <lb/>
            fore every man will also listen more readily to what is <lb/>
            spoken, if it is signified by appropriate and becoming <lb/>
            words. We must not say then that there is no faculty <lb/>
            of expression: for this affirmation is the characteristic of <lb/>
            an impious and also of a timid man. Of an impious man, <lb/>
            because he undervalues the gifts which come from God, <lb/>
            just as if he would take away the commodity of the power <lb/>
            of vision, or of hearing, or of seeing. Has then God <lb/>
            given you eyes to no purpose ? and to no purpose has he <lb/>
            infused into them a spirit1 so strong and of such skilful <lb/>
            contrivance as to reach a long way and to fashion the <lb/>
            forms of things which are seen? What messenger is so <lb/>
            swift and vigilant ? And to no purpose has he made the <lb/>
            interjacent atmosphere so efficacious and elastic that the <lb/>
            vision penetrates through the atmosphere which is in a <lb/>
            manner moved ?2 And to no purpose has he made light, <lb/>
            without the presence of which there would be no use in <lb/>
            any other thing ?</p>
          <p>Man, be neither ungrateful for these gifts nor yet forget <lb/>
            the things which are superior to them. But indeed for the <lb/>
            power of seeing and hearing, and indeed for life itself, and <lb/>
            for the things which contribute to support it, for the fruits <lb/>
            which are dry, and for wine and oil give thanks to God: <lb/>
            but remember that he has given you something else better <lb/>
            than all these, I mean the power of using them, proving <lb/>
            them and estimating the value of each. For what is that <note type="footnote"> 1 The word for ' spirit' is <foreign xml:lang="grc">πνέυ̃μα</foreign>, a vital spirit, an animal spirit, <lb/>

            whom gives information about each of these powers, what <lb/>
            each of them is worth ?3 Is it each faculty itself? Did <lb/>
            you ever hear the faculty of vision saying any thing about <lb/>
            itself? or the faculty of hearing? or wheat, or barley, or a <lb/>
            horse or a dog? No; but they are appointed as ministers <lb/>
            and slaves to serve the faculty which has the power of <lb/>
            making use of the appearances of things. And if you <lb/>
            inquire what is the value of each thing, of whom do you <lb/>
            inquire? who answers you? How then can any other <lb/>
            faculty be more powerful than this, which uses the rest as <lb/>
            ministers and itself proves each and pronounces about <lb/>
            them ? for which of them knows what itself is, and what <lb/>
            is its own value ? which of them knows when it ought <lb/>
            to employ itself and when not ? what faculty is it which <lb/>
            opens and closes the eyes, and turns them away from <lb/>
            objects to which it ought not to apply them and does <lb/>
            apply them to other objects ? Is it the faculty of vision ? <lb/>
            No; but it is the faculty of the will. What is that faculty <lb/>
            which closes and opens the ears? what is that by which <lb/>
            they are curious and inquisitive, or on the contrary un­ <lb/>
            moved by what is said? is it the faculty of hearing? <lb/>
            It is no other than the faculty of the will.4 Will this <lb/>
            faculty then, seeing that it is amidst all the other faculties <lb/>
            which are blind and dumb and unable to see any thing <lb/>
            else except the very acts for which they are appointed in <lb/>
            order to minister to this (faculty) and serve it, but this <lb/>
            faculty alone sees sharp and sees what is the value of each <lb/>
            of the rest; will this faculty declare to us that any thing <lb/>
            else is the best, or that itself is ? And what else does the <lb/>
            eye do when it is opened than see ? But whether we ought <lb/>
            to look on the wife of a certain person, and in what <lb/>
            manner, who tells us? The faculty of the will. And <lb/>
            whether we ought to believe what is said or not to believe <lb/>
            it, and if we do believe, whether we ought to be moved by <lb/>
            it or not, who tells us ? Is it not the faculty of the will ? <note type="footnote"> 3 See i. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Schweighaeuser has this note: ' That which Epictetus names the <lb/>

            But this faculty of speaking and of ornamenting words, <lb/>
            if there is indeed any such peculiar faculty, what else does <lb/>
            it do, when there happens to be discourse about a thing, <lb/>
            than to ornament the words and arrange them as hair­ <lb/>
            dressers do the hair ? But whether it is better to speak <lb/>
            or to be silent, and better to speak in this way or that <lb/>
            way, and whether this is becoming or not becoming, and <lb/>
            the season for each and the use, what else tells us than <lb/>
            the faculty of the will ? Would you have it then to come <lb/>
            forward and condemn itself?</p>
          <p>What then? it (the will) says,5 if the fact is so, can <lb/>
            that which ministers be superior to that to which it <lb/>
            ministers, can the horse be superior to the rider, or the <lb/>
            dog to the huntsman, or the instrument to the musician, <lb/>
            or the servants to the king? What is that which makes <lb/>
            use of the rest ? The will. What takes care of all ? The <lb/>
            will. What destroys the whole man, at one time by <lb/>
            hunger, at another time by hanging, and at another time <lb/>
            by a precipice ? The will. Then is any thing stronger <lb/>
            in men than this ? and how is it possible that the things <lb/>
            which are subject to restraint are stronger than that which <lb/>
            is not ? What things are naturally formed to hinder the <lb/>
            faculty of vision? Both will and things which do not <lb/>
            depend on the faculty of the will. 6 It is the same with <lb/>
            the faculty of hearing, with the faculty of speaking in <lb/>
            like manner. But what has a natural power of hinder­ <lb/>
            ing the will ? Nothing which is independent of the will; <lb/>
            but only the will itself, when it is perverted. Therefore <lb/>
            this (the will) is alone vice or alone virtue.</p>
          <p>Then being so great a faculty and set over all the rest, <lb/>
            let it (the will) come forward and tell us that the most <lb/>
            excellent of all things is the flesh. Not even if the flesh <lb/>
            itself declared that it is the most excellent, would any <lb/>
            person bear that it should say this. But what is it, Epi­ <lb/>

            Things, which wrote about the Canon (rule of truth), <lb/>
            which led you to wear a beard, which wrote when it was <lb/>
            dying that it was spending the last and a happy day ?8 <lb/>
            Was this the flesh or the will ? Then do you admit that <lb/>
            you possess any thing superior to this (the will) ? and are <lb/>
            you not mad? are you in fact so blind and deaf?</p>
          <p>What then ? does any man despise the other faculties ? <lb/>
            I hope not. Does any man say that there is no use or <lb/>
            excellence in the speaking faculty ? 9 I hope not. That <lb/>
            would be foolish, impious, ungrateful towards God. But <lb/>
            a man renders to each thing its due value. For there is <lb/>
            some use even in an ass, but not so much as in an ox: <lb/>
            there is also use in a dog, but not so much as in a slave: <lb/>
            there is also some use in a slave, but not so much as in <lb/>
            citizens: there is also some use in citizens, but not so <lb/>
            much as in magistrates. Not indeed because some things <lb/>
            are superior, must we undervalue the use which other <lb/>
            things have. There is a certain value in the power of <lb/>
            speaking, but it is not so great as the power of the will. <lb/>
            When then I speak thus, let no man think that I ask you <lb/>
            to neglect the power of speaking, for neither do I ask you <lb/>
            to neglect the eyes, nor the ears nor the hands nor the feet, <lb/>
            nor clothing nor shoes. But if you ask me what then is <lb/>
            the most excellent of all things, what must I say? I <lb/>
            cannot say the power of speaking, but the power of the, <lb/>
            will, when it is right (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθὴ</foreign>). For it is this which uses <lb/>
            the other (the power of speaking), and all the other <lb/>
            faculties both small and great. For when this faculty of <lb/>
            the will is set right, a man who is not good becomes good: <note type="footnote"> 7 This appears to be the book which Cicero (Tuscul. ii. 18) <lb/>

            but when it fails, a man becomes bad. It is through this <lb/>
            that we are unfortunate, that we are fortunate, that we <lb/>
            blame one another, are pleased with one another. In a <lb/>
            word, it is this which if we neglect it makes unhappiness, <lb/>
            and if we carefully look after it, makes happiness.</p>
          <p>But to take away the faculty of speaking and to say <lb/>
            that there is no such faculty in reality, is the act not only <lb/>
            of an ungrateful man towards those who gave it, but also <lb/>
            of a cowardly man: for such a person seems to me to fear, <lb/>
            if there is any faculty of this kind, that we shall not be <lb/>
            able to despise it. Such also are those who say that there <lb/>
            is no difference between beauty and ugliness. Then it <lb/>
            would happen that a man would be affected in the same <lb/>
            way if he saw Thersites and if he saw Achilles; in the <lb/>
            same way, if he saw Helen and any other woman. But <lb/>
            these are foolish and clownish notions, and the notions of <lb/>
            men who know not the nature of each thing, but are afraid, <lb/>
            if a man shall see the difference, that he shall immediately <lb/>
            be seized and carried off vanquished. But this is the <lb/>
            great matter; to leave to each thing the power (faculty) <lb/>
            which it has, and leaving to it this power to see what is <lb/>
            the worth of the power, and to learn what is the most <lb/>

            diligent about this, considering all other things of second.. <lb/>
            ary value compared with this, but yet, as far as we can, <lb/>
            not neglecting all those other things. For we must take <lb/>
            care of the eyes also, not as if they were the most excel­ <lb/>
            lent thing, but we must take care of them on account of <lb/>
            the most excellent thing, because it will not be in its true <lb/>

            traveller would do on his way to his own country, when <lb/>
            he enters a good inn, and being pleased with it should <lb/>
            remain there. Man, you have forgotten your purpose: <lb/>
            you were not travelling to this inn, but you were passing <lb/>
            through it,-But this is a pleasant inn.—And how many <lb/>
            other inns are pleasant? and how many meadows are <lb/>
            pleasant ? yet only for passing through. But your purpose <lb/>
            is this, to return to your country, to relieve your kinsmen <lb/>
            of anxiety, to discharge the duties of a citizen, to marry, to <lb/>

            in these where you were born and of which you were made <lb/>
            a citizen. Something of the kind takes place in the matter <lb/>
            which we are considering. Since by the aid of speech and <lb/>
            such communication as you receive here you must advance <lb/>
            to perfection, and purge your will and correct the faculty <lb/>
            which makes use of the appearances of things; and since <lb/>
            it is necessary also for the teaching (delivery) of theorems <lb/>
            to be effected by a certain mode of expression and with a <lb/>
            certain variety and sharpness, some persons captivated by <lb/>
            these very things abide in them, one captivated by the ex­ <lb/>

            and still another by some other inn (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πανδοκείυ</foreign>) of the kind; <lb/>
            and there they stay and waste away as if they were <lb/>

          <p>Man, your purpose (business) was to make yourself <lb/>
            capable of using comformably to nature the appearances <lb/>
            presented to you, in your desires not to be frustrated, <lb/>
            in your aversion from things not to fall into that which <lb/>
            you would avoid, never to have no luck (as one may say), <lb/>
            nor ever to have bad luck, to be free, not hindered, not <lb/>
            compelled, conforming yourself to the administration of <lb/>
            Zeus, obeying it, well satisfied with this, blaming no one, <lb/>
            charging no one with fault, able from your whole soul to <lb/>
            utter these verses <lb/>
            Lead me, 0 Zeus, and thou too Destiny,11 <lb/>
            Then having this purpose before you, if some little form of <lb/>
            expression pleases you, if some theorems please you, do <note type="footnote"> 10 The Stoics taught that a man should lead an active life. Horace <lb/>

            things are fine ? Who says that they are not fine ? but <lb/>
            only as being a way home, as inns are. For what hinders <lb/>
            you from being an unfortunate man, even if you speak like <lb/>

            in itself that it will be profitable to the husbandman, if <lb/>
            he does take care of it, invites him to exercise care. When <lb/>
            children are attractive and lively, whom do they not invite <lb/>
            to play with them, and crawl with them, and lisp with <lb/>
            them ? But who is eager to play with an ass or to bray <lb/>
            with it ? for though it is small, it is still a little ass.</p>
          <p>Why then do you say nothing to rile ? I can only say <lb/>
            this to you, that he who knows not who he is, and for <lb/>
            what purpose he exists, and what is this world, and with <lb/>
            whom he is associated, and what things are the good and <lb/>
            the bad, and the beautiful and the ugly, and who neither <lb/>
            understands discourse nor demonstration, nor what is true <lb/>
            nor what is false, and who is not able to distinguish them, <lb/>

            But had not Achilles more beautiful hair and gold co­ <lb/>

            But I am also strong. Can you then lift so great a stone <lb/>

          <p>This is all that I have to say to you; and I say even <lb/>

            <title type="sub">WHAT IS THE PROPERTY OF ERROR.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>EVERY error comprehends contradiction : for since he who <lb/>
            errs does not wish to err, but to be right, it is plain that <lb/>
            he does not do what he wishes. For what does the thief <lb/>
            wish to do ? That which is for his own interest.1 If then <lb/>
            the theft is not for his interest, he does not do that which <lb/>
            he wishes. But every rational soul is by nature offended <lb/>
            at contradiction, and so long as it does not understand this <lb/>
            contradiction, it is not hindered from doing contradictory <note type="footnote"> 1 See i. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Xenophon, Mem. ii. 9.4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            things: but when it does understand the contradiction, <lb/>
            it must of necessity avoid the contradiction and avoid <lb/>
            it as much as a man must dissent from the false when he <lb/>
            sees that a thing is false ; but so long as this falsehood <lb/>
            does not appear to him, he assents to it as to truth.</p>
          <p>He then is strong in argument and has the faculty of <lb/>
            exhorting and confuting, who is able to show to each man <lb/>
            the contradiction through which he errs and clearly to prove <lb/>
            how he does not do that which he wishes and does that <lb/>
            which he does not wish. For if any one shall show this, a <lb/>
            man will himself withdraw from that which he does; but <lb/>
            so long as you do not show this, do not be surprised if a <lb/>
            man persists in his practice; for having the appearance of <lb/>
            doing right, he does what he does. For this reason <lb/>
            Socrates also trusting to this power used to say, I am <lb/>
            used to call no other witness of what I say, but I am always <lb/>
            satisfied with him with whom I am discussing, and I ask <lb/>
            him to give his opinion and call him as a witness, and <lb/>
            though he is only one, he is sufficient in the place of all. <lb/>
            For Socrates knew by what the rational soul is moved, just <lb/>
            like a pair of scales, and then it must incline, whether it <lb/>
            chooses or not.2 Show the rational governing faculty a <lb/>
            contradiction, and it will withdraw from it; but if you do <lb/>
            not show it, rather blame yourself than him who is not <lb/>

          <p>A CERTAIN young man a rhetorician came to see Epictetus, <lb/>
            with his hair dressed more carefully than was usual and <lb/>
            nis attire in an ornamental style; whereupon Epictetus <lb/>
            said, Tell me if you do not think that some dogs are <lb/>
            beautiful and some horses, and so of all other animals. <lb/>
            I do think so, the youth replied. Are not then some men <lb/>
            also beautiful and others ugly ? Certainly. Do we then for <lb/>
            the same reason call each of them in the same kind beau­ <lb/>
            tiful, or each beautiful for something peculiar ? And you <lb/>
            will judge of this matter thus. Since we see a dog natu­ <lb/>
            rally formed for one thing, and a horse for another, and <lb/>
            for another still, as an example, a nightingale, we may <lb/>
            generally and not improperly declare each of them to be <lb/>
            beautiful then when it is most excellent according to its <lb/>
            nature; but since the nature of each is different, each of <lb/>
            them seems to me to be beautiful in a different way. Is it <lb/>
            not so ? He admitted that it was. That then which makes <lb/>
            a dog beautiful, makes a horse ugly; and that which <lb/>
            makes a horse beautiful, makes a dog ugly, if it is true <lb/>
            that their natures are different. It seems to be so. For <lb/>
            I think that what makes a Pancratiast beautiful, makes a <lb/>
            wrestler to be not good, and a runner to be most ridicu­ <lb/>
            lous; and he who is beautiful for the Pentathlon, is very <lb/>
            ugly for wrestling.1 It is so said he. What then makes <note type="footnote"> 1 A Pancratiast is a man who is trained for the Pancratium, that <lb/>
            is, both for boxing and wrestling. The Pentathlon comprised five <lb/>
            exercises, which are expressed by one Greek line, <lb/>
            Leaping, running, the quoit, throwing the javelin, wrestling. <lb/>

            a man beautiful? Is it that which in its kind makes <lb/>
            both a dog and a horse beautiful ? It is, he said. What <lb/>
            then makes a dog beautiful? The possession of the <lb/>
            excellence of a dog. And what makes a horse beautiful ? <lb/>
            The possession of the excellence of a horse. What <lb/>
            then makes a man beautiful ? Is it not the possession of <lb/>
            the excellence of a man? And do you then, if you <lb/>
            wish to be beautiful, young man, labour at this, the <lb/>
            acquisition of human excellence. But what is this? <lb/>
            Observe whom you yourself praise, when you praise <lb/>
            many persons without partiality: do you praise the <lb/>
            just or the unjust? The just. Whether do you praise <lb/>
            the moderate or the immoderate ? The moderate. And <lb/>
            the temperate or the intemperate? The temperate. If <lb/>
            then you make yourself such a person, you will know that <lb/>
            you will make yourself beautiful: but so long as you <lb/>
            neglect these things, you must be ugly (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχρόν</foreign>), even <lb/>
            though you contrive all you can to appear beautiful.</p>
          <p>Further I do not know what to say to you: for if I say <lb/>
            to you what I think, I shall offend you, and you will <lb/>
            perhaps leave the school and not return to it: and if I do <lb/>
            not say what I think, see how I shall be acting, if you <lb/>
            come to me to be improved, and I shall not improve you at <lb/>
            all, and if you come to me as to a philosopher, and I shall <lb/>
            say nothing to you as a philosopher. And how cruel it <lb/>
            is to you to leave you uncorrected. If at any time <lb/>
            afterwards you shall acquire sense, you will with good <lb/>
            reason blame me and say, What did Epictetus observe in <lb/>
            me that when he saw me in such a plight coming to him <lb/>
            in such a scandalous condition, he neglected me and never <lb/>
            said a word ? did he so much despair of me ? was I not <lb/>
            young? was I not able to listen to reason ? and how many <lb/>
            other young men at this age commit many like errors ? I <lb/>
            hear that a certain Polemon from being a most dissolute <lb/>
            youth underwent such a great change. Well, suppose that <lb/>
            he did not think that I should be a Polemon; 2 yet he <note type="footnote"> 3 Comp. Horace, Sat. it. 3, v. 253. <lb/>

            The story of Polemon is told by Diogenes Laertius. He was a dis­ <lb/>
            solute youth. As he was passing one day the place where Xenocratet </note> <lb/>

            might have set my hair right, he might have stripped off <lb/>
            my decorations, he might have stopped me from plucking <lb/>
            the hair out of my body; but when he saw me dressed <lb/>
            like-what shall I say ?-he kept silent. I do not say like <lb/>
            what; but you will say when you come to your senses, and <lb/>
            shall know what it is, and what persons use such a dress.</p>
          <p>If you bring this charge against me hereafter, what <lb/>
            defence shall I make? Why, shall I say that the man will <lb/>
            not be persuaded by me ? Was Laius persuaded by Apollo ? <lb/>
            Did he not go away and get drunk and show no care for <lb/>
            the oracle? 3 Well then for this reason did Apollo refuse <lb/>
            to tell him the truth? I indeed do not know, whether <lb/>
            you will be persuaded by me or not; but Apollo knew <lb/>
            most certainly that Laius would not be persuaded and yet <lb/>
            he spoke. But why did he speak ? I say in reply, But why <lb/>
            is he Apollo, and why does he deliver oracles, and why has <lb/>
            he fixed himself in this place as a prophet and source of <lb/>
            truth and for the inhabitants of the world to resort to <lb/>
            him ? and why are the words Know yourself written in <lb/>
            front of the temple, though no person takes any notice of <lb/>
            them?</p>
          <p>Did Socrates persuade all his hearers to take care of <lb/>
            themselves? Not the thousandth part. But however, <lb/>
            after he had been placed in this position by the deity, as <lb/>
            he himself says, he never left it. But what does he say <lb/>
            even to his judges? " If you acquit me on these con­ <lb/>
            ditions that I no longer do that which I do now, I will not <lb/>
            consent and I will not desist; but I will go up both to <lb/>
            young and to old, and, to speak plainly, to every man whom <lb/>
            I meet, and I will ask the questions which I ask now; and <lb/>
            most particularly will I do this to you my fellow citizens, <lb/>
            because you are more nearly related to me." 4—Are you so <note type="footnote"> was lecturing, he and his drunken companions burst into the school, <lb/>
            but Polemon was so affected by the words of the excellent teacher <lb/>
            that he came out quite a different man, and ultimately succeeded <lb/>
            Xenocrates in the school of the Academy. See Epict. iv. 11. 30. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Laius consulted the oracle at Delphi how he should have children. <lb/>

            for he begot children and brought them up. He did indeed order his <lb/>

            curious, Socrates, and such a busy-body ? and how ;does it <lb/>

            Here it is a great thing to say, " I am he whose duty it is <lb/>

            him, say to the bull, if you choose, and who are you, and <lb/>
            what business have you here ?'" Man, in every kind there <lb/>
            is produced something which excels; in oxen, in dogs, in <lb/>
            bees, in horses. Do not then say to that which excels, <lb/>
            Who then are you? If you do, it will find a voice in <lb/>

          <p>What then ? am I such a man ? Certainly not. And <lb/>
            are you such a man as can listen to the truth ? I wish <lb/>

            condemned to wear a white beard and a cloak, and you <lb/>
            come to me as to a philosopher, I will not treat you in a <lb/>
            cruel way nor yet as if I despaired of you, but I will say, <lb/>
            Young man, whom do you wish to make beautiful? In <lb/>
            the first place, know who you are and then adorn yourself <lb/>
            appropriately. You are a human being; and this is a <lb/>
            mortal animal which has the power of using appearances <lb/>
            rationally. But what is meant by 'rationally'? Con­ <lb/>

            possess which is peculiar? Is it the animal part? No. <lb/>
            Is it the condition of mortality ? No. Is it the power of <lb/>

            Woman is naturally smooth and delicate; and if she has <lb/>
            much hair (on her body), she is a monster and is exhibited <lb/>

            had in being adorned ? for whom would you have adorned <lb/>
            yourself, if all human creatures were women ? But you <lb/>

            to yourself, ‛ Epictetus has not said this to me; for how <lb/>
            could he ? but some propitious God through him: for it <lb/>
            would never have come into his thoughts to say this, since <lb/>
            he is not accustomed to talk thus with any person. Come <lb/>
            then let us obey God, that we may not be subject to his <lb/>
            anger.' You say, No. But (I say), if a crow by his <lb/>
            croaking signifies any thing to you, it is not the crow <lb/>
            which signifies, but God through the crow; and if he <lb/>
            signifies any thing through a human voice, will he not <lb/>
            cause the man to say this to you, that you may know the <lb/>
            power of the divinity, that he signifies to some in this <lb/>
            way, and to others in that way, and concerning the <lb/>
            greatest things and the chief he signifies through the <lb/>
            noblest messenger ? What else is it which the poet says: <lb/>

            The husband not to kill nor wed the wife.9</p>
          <p>Was Hermes going to descend from heaven to say this to <lb/>
            him (Aegisthus) ? And now the Gods say this to you and <lb/>
            send the messenger, the slayer of Argus, to warn you not <lb/>
            to pervert that which is well arranged, nor to busy your­ <lb/>
            self about it, but to allow a man to be a man, and a woman <lb/>
            to be a woman, a beautiful man to be as a beautiful man, <lb/>
            and an ugly man as an ugly man, for you are not flesh <lb/>
            and hair, but you are will (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>) ; and if your will is <lb/>
            beautiful, then you will be beautiful. But up to the <lb/>

            for I think that you are readier to hear anything than <lb/>

            man. The Stoics, according to Stobaeus, absurdly called virtue: <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign> (beautiful), because it naturally ' calls' (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καλεῖ</foreign>) to itself those <lb/>
            who desire it. The Stoics also said that every thing good was beautiful <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καλός</foreign>), and that the good and the beautiful were equivalent. Tho <lb/>
            Roman expression is Vir bonus et sapiens. (Hor. Epp., i. 7, 22 and 16, <lb/>
            20). Perhaps the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλὸς καὶ ἀγαθός</foreign> arose from the notion of <lb/>
            beauty and goodness being the combination of a perfect human being. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Antoninus, xi. 37, ‛ as to sensual desire he should altogether keep <lb/>

            topics the chief and the most urgent is that which relates <lb/>
            to the affects (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ πάθη</foreign>, perturbations); for an affect is <lb/>
            produced in no other way than by a failing to obtain that <lb/>
            which a man desires or falling into that which a man <lb/>
            would wish to avoid. This is that which brings in per­ <lb/>
            turbations, disorders, bad fortune, misfortunes, sorrows, <lb/>
            lamentations, and envy; that which makes men envious <lb/>
            and jealous; and by these causes we are unable even to <lb/>
            listen to the precepts of reason. The second topic con­ <lb/>
            cerns the duties of a man; for I ought not to be free <lb/>
            from affects (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαθῆ</foreign>) like a statue, but I ought to maintain <lb/>
            the relations (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχέσεις</foreign>) natural and acquired, as a pious <lb/>
            man, as a son, as a father, as a citizen.</p>
          <p>The third topic is that which immediately concerns <lb/>
            those who are making proficiency, that which concerns the <lb/>
            security of the other two, so that not even in sleep any <lb/>
            appearance unexamined may surprise us, nor in intoxica­ <lb/>
            tion, nor in melancholy. This, it may be said, is above <lb/>
            our power. But the present philosophers neglecting the <lb/>
            first topic and the second (the affects and duties), employ <lb/>
            themselves on the third, using sophistical arguments <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταπίπτοντας</foreign>), making conclusions from questioning, em­ <lb/>
            ploying hypotheses, lying. For a man must, as it is said, <lb/>
            when employed on these matters, take care that he is not <lb/>
            deceived. Who must? The wise and good man. This <lb/>
            then is all that is wanting to you. Have you successfully <lb/>
            worked out the rest? Are you free from deception in the <lb/>
            matter of money ? If you see a beautiful girl, do you resist <lb/>
            the appearance? If your neighbour obtains an estate by <lb/>
            will, are you not vexed? Now is there nothing else <lb/>
            wanting to you except unchangeable firmness of mind <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμεταπτωσία</foreign>) ? Wretch, you hear these very things with <lb/>
            fear and anxiety that some person may despise you, and <lb/>
            with inquiries about what any person may say about you. <lb/>
            And if a man come and tell you that in a certain conversa­ <lb/>
            tion in which the question was, Who is the best philoso­ <lb/>
            pher, a man who was present said that a certain person <lb/>
            was the chief philosopher, your little soul which was only <lb/>
            a finger's length stretches out to two cubits. But if <lb/>
            another who is present says, You are mistaken; it is not <lb/>
            worth while to listen to a certain person, for what does he <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            know? he has only the first principles, and no more? then <lb/>
            you are confounded, you grow pale, you cry out immediately, <lb/>
            I. will show him who I am, that I am a great philosopher,- <lb/>
            It is seen by these very things: why do you wish to show <lb/>
            it by others? Do you not know that Diogenes pointed <lb/>
            out one of the sophists in this way by stretching out his <lb/>
            middle finger? 4 And then when the man was wild with <lb/>
            rage, This, he said, is the certain person: I have pointed <lb/>
            him out to you. For a man is not shown by the finger, as <lb/>
            a stone or a piece of wood; but when any person shows <lb/>
            the man's principles, then he shows him as a man.</p>
          <p>Let us look at your principles also. For is it not plain <lb/>
            that you value not at all your own will (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>), but <lb/>
            you look externally to things which are independent of <lb/>
            your will ? For instance, what will a certain person say ? <lb/>
            and what will people think of you? will you be considered <lb/>
            a man of learning; have you read Chrysippus or Antipater? <lb/>
            for if you have read Archedemus5 also, you have every thing <lb/>
            [that you can desire]. Why are you still uneasy lest you <lb/>
            should not show us who you are? Would you let me tell <lb/>
            you what manner of man you have shown us that you are ? <lb/>
            You have exhibited yourself to us as a mean fellow, <lb/>
            querulous, passionate, cowardly, finding fault with every <lb/>
            thing, blaming every body, never quiet, vain: this is what <lb/>
            you have exhibited to us. Go away now and read Arche­ <lb/>
            demus; then if a mouse should leap down and make a <lb/>
            noise, you are a dead man. For such a death awaits you <lb/>
            as it did 6—what was the man's name ?—Crinis; and he too <lb/>
            was proud, because he understood Archedemus.</p>
          <p>Wretch, will you not dismiss these things that do not <lb/>
            concern you at all? These things are suitable to those <lb/>
            who are able to learn them without perturbation, to those <lb/>
            who can say : " I am not subject to anger, to grief, to <lb/>
            envy: I am not hindered, I am not restrained. What <note type="footnote"> 4 To point out a man with the middle finger was a way of showing <lb/>

            romains for me ? I have leisure, I am tranquil: let us <lb/>
            see how we must deal with sophistical arguments; 7 let us <lb/>
            see how when a man has accepted an hypothesis he shall <lb/>
            not be led away to any thing absurd." To them such <lb/>
            things belong. To those who are happy it is appropriate <lb/>
            to light a fire, to dine; if they choose, both to sing and <lb/>
            to dance. But when the vessel is sinking, you come to <lb/>

            <title type="sub">WHAT IS THE MATTER ON WHICH A GOOD MAN SHOULD BE EMPLOYED, AND IN WHAT WE OUGHT CHIEFLY TO PRACTISE OURSELVES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE material for the wise and good man is his own ruling <lb/>
            faculty: and the body is the material for the physician <lb/>
            and the aliptes (the man who oils persons); the land is <lb/>
            the matter for the husbandman. The business of the wise <lb/>
            and good man is to use appearances conformably to nature: <lb/>
            and as it is the nature of every soul to assent to the truth, <lb/>
            to dissent from the false, and to remain in suspense as to <lb/>
            that which is uncertain; so it is its nature to be moved <lb/>
            towards the desire of the good, and to aversion from the <lb/>
            evil; and with respect to that which is neither good nor <lb/>
            bad it feels indifferent. For as the money-changer (banker) <lb/>
            is not allowed to reject Caesar's coin, nor the seller of herbs, <lb/>
            but if you show the coin, whether he chooses or not, he <lb/>
            must give up what is sold for the coin; so it is also in the <lb/>
            matter of the soul. When the good appears, it immediately <note type="footnote"> 7 See this chapter above. </note><note type="footnote"> a TOuS <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιφάρους</foreign>. On this reading the student may consult the note <lb/>
            in Schweighaeuser's edition. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιφάρους</foreign>, if it is the right <lb/>
            reading, is not clear; nor the meaning of this conclusion. </note><note type="footnote"> The philosopher is represented as being full of anxiety about things <lb/>
            which do not concern him, and which are proper subjects for those <lb/>
            only who are free from disturbing passions and are quite happy, which in <lb/>
            not the philosopher's condition. He is compared to a sinking ship, and <lb/>
            at this very time he is supposed to be employed in the useless labour <lb/>
            of hoisting the sails. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            attracts to itself; the evil repels from itself. But the soul <lb/>
            will never reject the manifest appearance of the good, any <lb/>
            more than persons will reject Caesar's coin. On this <lb/>
            principle depends every movement both of man and God.1</p>
          <p>For this reason the good is preferred to every intimate <lb/>
            relationship (obligation). There is no intimate relation­ <lb/>
            ship between me and my father, but there is between me <lb/>
            and the good. Are you so hard-hearted? Yes, for such is <lb/>
            my nature; and this is the coin which God has given me. <lb/>
            For this reason if the good is something different from the <lb/>
            beautiful and the just, both father is gone (neglected), and <lb/>
            brother and country, and everything. But shall I overlook <lb/>
            my own good, in order that you may have it, and shall I <lb/>
            give it up to you ? Why ? I am your father. But you are <lb/>
            not my good. I am your brother. But you are not my <lb/>
            good. But if we place the good in a right determination <lb/>
            of the will, the very observance of the relations of life is <lb/>
            good, and accordingly he who gives up any external things, <lb/>
            obtains that which is good. Your father takes away your <lb/>
            property. But he does not injure you. Your brother will <lb/>
            have the greater part of the estate in land. Let him have <lb/>
            as much as he chooses. Will he then have a greater share <lb/>
            of modesty, of fidelity, of brotherly affection ? For who will <lb/>
            eject you from this possession ? Not even Zeus, for neither <lb/>
            has he chosen to do so; but he has made this in my own <lb/>
            power, and he has given it to me just as he possessed it <lb/>
            himself, free from hindrance, compulsion, and impediment. <lb/>
            When then the coin which another uses is a different coin, <lb/>
            if a man presents this coin, he receives that which is <lb/>
            sold for it. Suppose that there comes into the province a <lb/>
            thievish proconsul, what coin does he use? Silver coin. <lb/>
            Show it to him, and carry off what you please. Suppose <lb/>
            one comes who is an adulterer: what coin does he use ? <lb/>
            Little girls. Take, a man says, the coin, and sell me the <lb/>
            small thing. Give, says the seller, and buy [ what you want]. <lb/>
            Another is eager to possess boys. Give him the coin, and <lb/>
            receive what you wish. Another is fond of hunting: give <lb/>
            him a fine nag or a dog. Though he groans and laments, <lb/>
            he will sell for it that which ycu want. For another <note type="footnote"> 1 Comp. i. 19, 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            compels him from within, he who has fixed (determined) <lb/>
            this coin.2</p>
          <p>Against (or with respect to) this kind of thing chiefly a <lb/>
            man should exercise himself. As soon as you go out in the <lb/>
            morning, examine every man whom you see, every man <lb/>
            whom you hear; answer as to a question, What have you <lb/>
            seen? A handsome man or woman ? Apply the rule. Is <lb/>
            this independent of the will, or dependent? Independent. <lb/>
            Take it away. What have you seen ? A man lamenting <lb/>
            over the death of a child. Apply the rule. Death is a <lb/>
            thing independent of the will. Take it away. Has the <lb/>
            proconsul met you ? Apply the rule. What kind of thing is <lb/>
            a proconsul's office? Independent of the will, or dependent <lb/>
            on it? Independent. Take this away also: it does not <lb/>
            stand examination: cast it away : it is nothing to you.</p>
          <p>If we practised this and exercised ourselves in it daily <lb/>
            from morning to night, something indeed would be done. <lb/>
            But now we are forthwith caught half asleep by every <lb/>
            appearance, and it is only, if ever, that in the school we arc <lb/>
            roused a little. Then when we go out, if we see a man <lb/>
            lamenting, we say, He is undone. If we see a consul, <lb/>
            we say, He is happy. If we see an exiled man, we say, He <lb/>
            is miserable. If we see a poor man, we say, He is wretched: <lb/>
            he has nothing to eat.</p>
          <p>We ought-then to eradicate these bad opinions, and to <lb/>
            this end we should direct all our efforts. For what is <lb/>
            weeping and lamenting ? Opinion. What is bad fortune ? <lb/>
            Opinion. What is civil sedition, what is divided opinion, <lb/>
            what is blame, what is accusation, what is impiety, what is <note type="footnote"> 2 Mrs. Carter compares the Epistle to the Romans, vii. 21-23. <lb/>
            Schweighaeuser says, the man either sees that the thing which he is <lb/>
            doing is bad or unjust, or for any other reason lie does not do the <lb/>
            thing willingly; but he is compelled, and allows himself to be carried <lb/>
            away by the passion which rules him. The ' another' who compels <lb/>
            is God, Schweig. says, who has made the nature of man such, that <lb/>
            he must postpone every thing else to that thing in which he places <lb/>
            his Good: and he adds, that it is man's fault if he places his good in <lb/>

            unlucky. He is like him ' who sees,' as the Latin poet says, the <lb/>

            trifling ? All these things are opinions, and nothing more, <lb/>
            and opinions about things independent of the will, as if they <lb/>
            were good and bad. Let a man transfer these opinions to <lb/>
            things dependent on the will, and I engage for him that he <lb/>
            will be firm and constant, whatever may be the state of <lb/>
            things around him. Such as is a dish of water, such is the <lb/>

            such are the appearances. When the water is moved, the <lb/>
            ray also seems to be moved, yet it is not moved. And when <lb/>
            then a man is seized with giddiness, it is not the arts and <lb/>
            the virtues which are confounded, but the spirit (the <lb/>
            nervous power) on which they are impressed; but if the <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE governor of Epirus having shown his favour to an <lb/>
            actor in an unseemly way and being publicly blamed on <lb/>
            this account, and afterwards having reported to Epictetus <lb/>
            that he was blamed and that he was vexed at those who <lb/>
            blamed him, Epictetus said, What harm have they been <lb/>
            doing? These men also were acting as partizans, as you <lb/>
            were doing. The governor replied, Does then any person <lb/>
            show his partizanship in this way ? When they see you, <lb/>
            said Epictetus, who are their governor, a friend of Caesar <lb/>
            and his deputy, showing partizanship in this way, was it <lb/>
            not to be expected that they also should show their par­ <lb/>
            tizanship in the same way ? for if it is not right to show <lb/>
            partizanship in this way, do not do so yourself; and if it is <lb/>
            right, why are you angry if they followed your example ? <lb/>
            For whom have the many to imitate except you, who are <lb/>
            their superiors? to whose example should they look when <note type="footnote"> 3 See Schweig.'s note on this obscure passage. </note> <lb/>

            they go to the theatre except yours ? See how the deputy <lb/>
            of Caesar looks on : he has cried out, and I too then will <lb/>
            cry out. He springs up from his seat, and I will spring <lb/>
            up. His slaves sit in various parts of the theatre and call <lb/>
            out. I have no slaves, but I will myself cry out as much as <lb/>
            I can and as loud as all of them together. You ought then <lb/>
            o know when you enter the theatre that you enter as a <lb/>
            rule and example to the rest how they ought to look at <lb/>
            the acting. Why then did they blame you? Because <lb/>
            every man hates that which is a hindrance to him. They <lb/>
            wished one person to be crowned; you wished another. <lb/>
            They were a hindrance to you, and you were a hindrance <lb/>
            to them. You were found to be the stronger; and they <lb/>
            did what they could; they blamed that which hindered <lb/>
            them. What then would you have ? That you should do <lb/>
            what you please, and they should not even say what they <lb/>
            please ? And what is the wonder ? Do not the husband­ <lb/>
            men abuse Zeus when they are hindered by him? do not <lb/>
            the sailors abuse him ? do they ever cease abusing Caesar ? <lb/>
            What then? does not Zeus know? is not what is said <lb/>
            reported to Caesar? What then does he do? he knows <lb/>
            that, if he punished all who abuse him, he would have <lb/>
            nobody to rule over. What then ? when you enter the <lb/>
            theatre, you ought to say not, Let Sophron (some actor) be <lb/>
            crowned, but you ought to say this, Come let me maintain <lb/>
            ray will in this matter so that it shall be conformable to <lb/>
            nature : no man is dearer to me than myself. It would be <lb/>
            ridiculous then for me to be hurt (injured) in order that <lb/>
            another who is an actor may be crowned. Whom then do <lb/>
            I wish to gain the prize ? Why the actor who does gain <lb/>
            the prize; and so he will always gain the prize whom I <lb/>
            wish to gain it.-But I wish Sophron to be crowned.- <lb/>

            Nemean, Pythian, Isthmian, Olympian, and proclaim him <lb/>
            victor. But in public do not claim more than your due, <lb/>
            nor attempt to appropriate to yourself what belongs to all. <lb/>
            If you do not consent to this, bear being abused: for when <lb/>
            you do the same as the many, you put yourself on the <lb/>

            which may be useful to the exercise of your will, that it <lb/>
            may be corrected ? For if you are doing nothing towards <lb/>
            this end, it was to no purpose that you came. Go away. <lb/>
            Look after your affairs at home. For if your ruling power <lb/>
            cannot be maintained in a state conformable to nature, it <lb/>
            is possible that your land can, that you will be able to <lb/>

            office: being bad you will do badly any thing else that you <lb/>
            have to do. But if you understand yourself, and know <lb/>
            that you are casting away certain bad opinions and adopting <lb/>
            others in their place, and if you have changed your state of <lb/>
            life from things which are not within your will to things. <lb/>
            which are within your will, and if you ever say, Alas! you <lb/>
            are not saying what you say on account of your father, or <lb/>
            your brother, but on account of yourself, do you still allege­ <lb/>
            your sickness ? Do you not know that both disease and <lb/>
            death must surprise us while we are doing something? <lb/>
            the husbandman while he is tilling the ground, the sailor <lb/>

          <p>WHEN some person asked him how it happened that since <lb/>
            reason has been more cultivated by the men of the present <lb/>
            age, the progress made in former times was greater. In <lb/>
            what respect, he answered, has it been more cultivated <lb/>
            now, and in what respect was the progress greater then? <lb/>
            For in that in which it has now been more cultivated, in <lb/>
            that also the progress will now be found. At present it <lb/>
            has been cultivated for the purpose of resolving syllogisms, <lb/>
            and progress is made. But in former times it was culti­ <lb/>
            vated for the purpose of maintaining the governing faculty <lb/>
            in a condition conformable to nature, and progress was <lb/>
            made. Do not then mix things which are different, and <lb/>
            do not expect, when you are labouring at one thing to <lb/>
            make progress in another. But see if any man among us <lb/>
            when he is intent upon this, the keeping himself in a state <note type="footnote"> 3 Socrates never professed to teach virtue, but by showing himself <lb/>

            conformable to nature and living so always, does not make <lb/>
            progress. For you will not find such a man.</p>
          <p>The good man is invincible, for he does not enter the <lb/>
            contest where he is not stronger. If you (his adversary) <lb/>
            want to have his land and all that is on it, take the land; <lb/>
            take his slaves, take his magisterial office, take his poor <lb/>

            it seeks, nor his aversion fall into that which he would <lb/>
            avoid. The only contest into which he enters is that about <lb/>
            things which are within the power of his will; how then <lb/>
            will he not be invincible?</p>
          <p>Some person having asked him what is Common sense, <lb/>
            Epictetus replied, As that may be called a certain Common <lb/>
            hearing which only distinguishes vocal sounds, and that <lb/>
            which distinguishes musical sounds is not Common, but <lb/>
            artificial; so there are certain things which men, who are <lb/>
            not altogether perverted, see by the common notions which <lb/>
            all possess. Such a constitution of the mind is named <lb/>
            Common sensed</p>
          <p>It is not easy to exhort weak young men; for neither <lb/>
            is it easy to hold (soft) cheese with a hook.2 But those <lb/>
            who have a good natural disposition, even if you try to <lb/>
            turn them aside, cling still more to reason. Wherefore <lb/>
            Rufus 3 generally attempted to discourage (his pupils), and <lb/>
            he used this method as a test of those who had a good <lb/>
            natural disposition and those who had not. For it was his <lb/>
            habit to say, as a stone, if you cast it upwards, will be <lb/>
            brought down to the earth by its own nature, so the man <lb/>
            whose mind is naturally good, the more you repel him, <lb/>
            the more he turns towards that to which he is naturally <lb/>
            inclined. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοίνος νοῦς</foreign>, the Communis sensus of the Romans, and <lb/>

            <title type="sub">TO THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE FREE CITIES WHO WAS AN EPICUREAN.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHEN the administrator came to visit him, and the man <lb/>
            was an Epicurean, Epictetus said, It is proper for us who <lb/>
            are not philosophers to inquire of you who are philoso­ <lb/>
            phers,2 as those who come to a strange city inquire of the <lb/>
            citizens and those who are acquainted with it, what is <lb/>
            the best thing in the world, in order that we also after <lb/>
            inquiry may go in quest of that which is best and look <lb/>
            at it, as strangers do with the things in cities. For <lb/>
            that there are three things which relate to man, soul, <lb/>
            body, and things external, scarcely any man denies. It <lb/>
            remains for you philosophers to answer what is the <lb/>
            best. What shall we say to men ? Is the flesh the best ? <lb/>
            and was it for this that Maximus3 sailed as far as Cas­ <lb/>
            siope in winter (or bad weather) with his son, and ac­ <lb/>
            companied him that he might be gratified in the flesh? <lb/>
            When the man said that it was not, and added, Far be <lb/>
            that from him.—Is it not fit then, Epictetus said, to <lb/>
            be actively employed about the best ? It is certainly of <lb/>
            all things the most fit. What then do we possess which <lb/>
            is better than the flesh? The soul, he replied. And the <lb/>
            good things of the best, are they better, or the good things <lb/>
            of the worse ? The good things of the best. And are the <lb/>
            good things of the best within the power of the will <lb/>
            or not within the power of the will ? They are within <lb/>
            the power of the will. Is then the pleasure of the soul <lb/>
            a thing within the power of the will ? It is, he replied. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">διορθωτής</foreign>. The Latin word is Corrector, which <lb/>
            occurs in inscriptions, and elsewhere. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Epicureans are ironically named Philosophers, for most of <lb/>

            And on what shall this pleasure depend ? On itself? But <lb/>
            that can not be conceived: for there must first exist a <lb/>
            certain substance or nature (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>) of good, by obtaining <lb/>
            which we shall have pleasure in the soul. He assented to <lb/>
            this also. On what then shall we depend for this pleasure <lb/>
            of the soul ? for if it shall depend on things of the soul,4 <lb/>
            the substance (nature) of the good is discovered; for good <lb/>
            can not be one thing, and that at which we are rationally <lb/>
            delighted another thing; nor if that which precedes is not <lb/>
            good, can that which comes after be good, for in order that <lb/>
            the thing which comes after may be good, that which <lb/>
            precedes must be good. But you would not affirm this. <lb/>
            if you are in your right mind, for you would then say <lb/>
            what is inconsistent both with Epicurus and the rest of <lb/>
            your doctrines. It remains then that the pleasure of the <lb/>
            soul is in the pleasure from things of the body: and again <lb/>
            that those bodily things must be the things which precede <lb/>
            and the substance (nature) of the good.</p>
          <p>For this reason Maximus acted foolishly if he made the <lb/>
            voyage for any other reason than for the sake of the flesh, <lb/>
            that is, for the sake of the best. And also a man acts <lb/>
            foolishly if he abstains from that which belongs to others, <lb/>
            when he is a judge (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστής</foreign>) and able to take it. But, <lb/>
            if you please, let us consider this only, how this thing may <lb/>
            be done secretly, and safely, and so that no man will know <lb/>
            it. For not even does Epicurus himself declare stealing to <lb/>
            be bad,5 but he admits that detection is; and because it <lb/>
            is impossible to have security against detection, for this <lb/>
            reason he says, Do not steal. But I say to you that if <lb/>
            stealing is done cleverly and cautiously, we shall not be <lb/>
            detected: further also we have powerful friends in Rome <lb/>
            both men and women, and the Hellenes (Greeks) are weak, <lb/>
            and no man will venture to go up to Rome for the purpose <lb/>
            (of complaining). Why do you refrain from your own <lb/>
            good? This is senseless, foolish. But even if you tell me <lb/>
            that you do refrain, I will not believe you. For as it is <note type="footnote"> 4 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχικοῖς</foreign> is Lord Shaftesbury's emendation in place of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθοῖς</foreign>, and <lb/>
            it is accepted by Schweighaeuser. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Diogenes Laertius (x. 151), quoted by Upton. 'Injustice,' says <lb/>

            Impossible to assent to that which appears false, and to <lb/>
            turn away from that which is true, so it is impossible <lb/>
            to abstain from that which appears good. But wealth is <lb/>
            a. good thing, and certainly most efficient in producing <lb/>
            pleasure. Why will you not acquire wealth ? And why <lb/>
            should we not corrupt our neighbor's wife, if wo can do <lb/>
            it without detection ? and if the husband foolishly prates <lb/>
            about the matter, why not pitch him out of the house? If <lb/>
            you would be a philosopher such as you ought to be, if a <lb/>
            perfect philosopher, if consistent with your own doctrines, <lb/>
            [you must act thus]. If you would not, you will not <lb/>
            differ at all from us who are called Stoics; for wo also say <lb/>
            one thing, but we do another : we talk of the things which <lb/>
            are beautiful (good), but we do what is base. But you <lb/>
            will bo perverse in the contrary way, teaching what is <lb/>
            bad, practising what is good.6</p>
          <p>In the name of God,7 are you thinking of a city of Epi­ <lb/>

            (leading things, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ προηγούμενα</foreign>). What are these? Engaging <lb/>

            and according to our nature. And how are we constituted <lb/>
            by nature ? Free, noble, modest: for what other animal <lb/>
            blushes ? what other is capable of receiving the appearance <lb/>
            (the impression) of shame ? and we are so constituted by <lb/>
            nature as to subject pleasure to these things, as a minister, <lb/>
            a servant, in order that it may call forth our activity, in <lb/>

          <p>As we exercise ourselves against sophistical questions, so <lb/>
            we ought to exercise ourselves daily against appearances; <lb/>
            for these appearances also propose questions to us. A <lb/>
            certain person's bon is dead. Answer; the thing is not <lb/>
            within the power of the will: it is not an evil. A father <lb/>
            has disinherited a certain son. What do you think of it? <lb/>
            It is a thing beyond the power of the will, not an evil. <lb/>
            Caesar has condemned a person. It is a thing beyond the <lb/>
            power of the will, not an evil. The man is afflicted at this. <lb/>
            Affliction is a thing which depends on the will: it is an <lb/>
            evil. He has borne the condemnation bravely. That is a <lb/>
            thing within the power of the will: it is a good. If we <lb/>
            train ourselves in this manner, we shall make progress; <lb/>
            for we shall never assent to any thing of which there is not <lb/>
            an appearance capable of being comprehended. Your son <lb/>
            is dead. What has happened ? Your SOil is dead. Nothing <lb/>
            more? Nothing. Your ship is lost. What has happened? <lb/>
            Your ship is lost. A man has been led to prison. What has <lb/>
            happened ? He has been led to prison. But that herein he <lb/>
            has fared badly, every man adds from his own opinion. But <lb/>
            Zeus, you say, does not do right in these matters. Why ? <lb/>
            because he has made you capable of endurance ? because he <lb/>
            has made you magnanimous ? because he has taken from that <lb/>
            which befalls you the power of being evils ? because it is in <lb/>
            your power to be happy while you are suffering what you <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WHEN a certain person came to him, who was going up to <lb/>
            Rome on account of a suit which bad regard to his rank, <lb/>
            Epictetus enquired the reason of his going to Rome, and <lb/>
            the man then a"-Iced what he thought about the matter. <lb/>
            Epictetus replied, If you ask me what you will do in <lb/>
            Rome, whether you will succeed or fail, I have no rule <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεώρημα</foreign>) about this. But if you ask me how you will <lb/>
            fare, I can tell you: if you have right opinions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγματα</foreign>), <lb/>
            you will fare well; if they are false, you will fare ill. <lb/>
            For to every man the cause of his acting is opinion. For <lb/>
            what is the reason why you desired to be elected governor <lb/>
            of the Cnossians? Your opinion. What is the reason <lb/>
            that you are now going up to Rome ? Your opinion. And <lb/>
            going in winter, and with danger and expense.—I must <lb/>
            go.-What tells you this? Your opinion. Then if opi­ <lb/>
            nions are the causes of all actions, and a man has bad <lb/>
            opinions, such as the cause may be, such also is the effect. <lb/>
            Have we then all sound opinions, both you and your <lb/>
            adversary? And how do you differ? But have you <lb/>
            sounder opinions than your adversary? Why? You <lb/>
            think so. And so does he think that his opinions are <lb/>
            better; and so do madmen. This is a bad criterion. <lb/>
            But show to me that you have made some inquiry <lb/>
            into your opinions and have taken some pains about <lb/>
            them. And as now you are sailing to Rome in order <lb/>
            to become governor of the Cnossians, and you are not <lb/>
            content to stay at home with the honours which you had, <lb/>
            but you desire something greater and more conspicuous, <lb/>
            so when did you ever make a voyage for the purpose <lb/>
            of examining your own opinions, and casting them out, if <lb/>
            you have any that are bad ? Whom have you approached <lb/>
            for this purpose ? What time have you fixed for it ? What <lb/>
            age? Go over the times of your life by yourself, if you <lb/>
            are ashamed of me (knowing the fact) when you were a <lb/>
            boy, did you examine your own opinions ? and did you not <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            then, as you do all things now, do as you did do? and <lb/>
            when you were become a youth and attended the rheto­ <lb/>
            ricians, and yourself practised rhetoric, what did you imagine <lb/>
            that you were deficient in ? And when you were a young <lb/>
            man and engaged in public matters, and pleaded causes <lb/>
            yourself, and were gaining reputation, who then seemed <lb/>
            your equal ? And when would you have submitted to any <lb/>
            man examining and showing that your opinions are bad ? <lb/>
            What then do you wish me to say to you?—Help me in <lb/>
            this matter.-I have no theorem (rule) for this. Nor have <lb/>
            you, if you came to me for this purpose, come to me as a <lb/>
            philosopher, but as to a seller of vegetables or a shoemaker. <lb/>
            For what purpose then have philosopher theorems ? For <lb/>
            this purpose, that whatever may happen, our ruling faculty <lb/>
            may be and continue to be conformable to nature. Does <lb/>
            this seem to you a small thing ?-No; but the greatest. <lb/>
            -What then ? does it need only a short time ? and is it <lb/>
            possible to seize it as you pass by ? If you can, seize it.</p>
          <p>Then you will say, I met with Epictetus as I should <lb/>
            meet with a stone or a statue: for you saw me, and nothing <lb/>
            more. But he meets with a man as a man, who learns his <lb/>
            opinions, and in his turn shows his own. Learn my <lb/>
            opinions: show me yours; and then say that you have <lb/>
            visited me. Let us examine one another: if I have any <lb/>
            bad opinion, take it away : if you have any, show it. This <lb/>
            is the meaning of meeting with a philosopher.-Not so, <lb/>
            (you say) : but this is only a passing visit, and while we <lb/>
            are hiring the vessel, we can also see Epictetus. Let us <lb/>
            see what he says. Then you go away and say: Epictetus <lb/>
            was nothing; he used solecisms and spoke in a barbarous <lb/>
            way. For of what else do you come as judges ?-Well, <lb/>
            but a man may say to me, if I attend to such matters1 (as <lb/>
            you do), I shall have no land, as you have none; I shall <lb/>
            have no silver cups as you have none, nor fine beasts as <lb/>
            you have none,-In answer to this it is perhaps sufficient <lb/>
            to say: I have no need of such things: but if you possess <lb/>
            many things, you have need of others: whether you <lb/>
            choose or not, you are poorer than I am. What then have <lb/>
            I need of? Of that which you have not: of firmness, of a <note type="footnote"> 1 See Schweig.'s note. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            mind which is conformable to nature, of being free from <lb/>
            perturbation. Whether I have a patron 2 or not, what is <lb/>
            that to me ? but it is something to you. I am richer than <lb/>
            you: I am not anxious what Caesar will think of me: for <lb/>
            this reason, I flatter no man. This is what I possess <lb/>
            instead of vessels of silver and gold. You have utensils <lb/>
            of gold; but your discourse, your opinions, your assents, <lb/>
            your movements (pursuits), your desires are of earthen <lb/>
            ware. But when I have these things conformable to <lb/>
            nature, why should I not employ my studies also upon <lb/>
            reason? for I have leisure: my mind is not distracted. <lb/>
            What shall I do, since I have no distraction ? What more <lb/>
            suitable to a man have I than this? When you have <lb/>
            nothing to do, you are disturbed, you go to the theatre or <lb/>
            you wander about without a purpose. Why should not <lb/>
            the philosopher labour to improve his reason? You <lb/>
            employ yourself about crystal vessels: I employ myself <lb/>
            about the syllogism named the lying : 3 you about <lb/>
            myrrhine 4 vessels; I employ myself about the syllogism <lb/>
            named the denying (<foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑ ἀποφάσκονος</foreign>). To you every <lb/>
            thing appears small that you possess: to me all that I <lb/>
            have appears great. Your desire is insatiable: mine is <lb/>
            satisfied. To (children) who put their hand into a narrow­ <lb/>
            necked earthen vessel and bring out figs and nuts, this <lb/>
            happens; if they fill the hand, they cannot take it out, <lb/>
            and then they cry. Drop a few of them and you will <lb/>
            draw things out. And do you part with your desires: <lb/>
            do not desire many things and you will have what you <lb/>
            want. <note type="footnote"> 2 The Roman word ' patronus,' which at that time had the sense of <lb/>

            blows should give up the Pancratium. In the Pancratium <lb/>
            it is in our power to desist and not to receive blows. But <lb/>
            in the other matter if we give up philosophy, what shall <lb/>
            we gain ? What then should a man say on the occasion of <lb/>
            each painful thing? It was for this that I exercised <lb/>
            myself, for this I disciplined myself. God says to you, <lb/>
            Give me a proof that you have duly practised athletics,5 <lb/>
            that you have eaten what you ought, that you have been <lb/>
            exercised, that you have obeyed the aliptes (the oiler and <lb/>
            rubber). Then do you show yourself weak when the time <lb/>
            for action comes ? Now is the time for the fever. Let it <lb/>
            be borne well. Now is the time for thirst, bear it well; <lb/>
            now is the time for hunger, bear it well. Is it not in your <lb/>
            power ? who shall hinder you? The physician will hinder <lb/>
            you from drinking; but he cannot prevent you from <lb/>
            bearing thirst well: and he will hinder you from eating; <lb/>
            but he cannot prevent you from bearing hunger well.</p>
          <p>But I cannot attend to my philosophical studies.6 And <lb/>
            for what purpose do you follow them? Slave, is it not <lb/>
            that you may be happy, that you may be constant, is it <lb/>
            not that you may be in a state conformable to nature and <lb/>
            live so ? What hinders you when you have a fever from <lb/>
            having your ruling faculty conformable to nature ? Here <lb/>
            is the proof of the thing, here is the test of the philosopher. <lb/>
            For this also is a part of life, like walking, like sailing, <lb/>
            like journeying by land, so also is fever. Do you read <lb/>
            when you are walking? No. Nor do you when youhave <lb/>
            a fever. But if you walk about well, you have all that <lb/>
            belongs to a man who walks. If you bear a fever well, <lb/>
            you have all that belongs to a man in a fever. What is <lb/>
            it to bear a fever well ? Not to blame God or man; not to <lb/>
            be afflicted at that which happens, to expect death well <lb/>
            and nobly, to do what must be done: when the physician <lb/>
            comes in, not to be frightened at what he says; nor if he <lb/>
            says, ' you are doing well,'7 to be overjoyed. For what <lb/>
            good has he told you? and when you were in health, <lb/>
            what good was that to you ? And even if he says, ' you <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὶ νομίμως ἤθλησας</foreign>. ' St. Paul Lath made use of this very expres­ <lb/>

            are in a bad way,' do not despond. For what is it to be <lb/>
            ill ? is it that you are near the severance of the soul and <lb/>
            the body? what harm is there in this? If you are not <lb/>
            near now, will you not afterwards be near ? Is the world <lb/>
            going to be turned upside down when you are dead? <lb/>
            Why then do you flatter the physician ? 8 Why do you say <lb/>
            if you please, master, I shall be well ? 9 Why do you give <lb/>
            him an opportunity of raising his eyebrows (being proud; <lb/>
            or showing his importance) ? 10 Do you not value a <lb/>
            physician, as you do a shoemaker when he is measuring <lb/>
            your foot, or a carpenter when he is building your house, <lb/>
            and so treat the physician as to the body which is not <lb/>
            yours, but by nature dead? He who has a fever has an <lb/>
            opportunity of doing this: if he does these things, he has <lb/>
            what belongs to him. For it is not the business of a <lb/>
            philosopher to look after these externals, neither his wine <lb/>
            nor his oil nor his poor body, but his own ruling power. <lb/>
            But as to externals how must he act ? so far as not to be <lb/>
            careless about them. Where then is there reason for fear ? <lb/>
            where is there then still reason for anger, and of fear about <lb/>
            what belongs to others, about things which are of no value ? <lb/>
            For we ought to have these two principles in readiness, <lb/>
            that except the will nothing is good nor bad; and that <lb/>
            we ought not to lead events, but to follow them.11—My <lb/>
            brother 12 ought not to have behaved thus to me.—No; but <lb/>
            he will see to that: and, however he may behave, I will <lb/>
            conduct myself towards him as I ought. For this is my <lb/>
            own business: that belongs to another; no man can pre­ <lb/>
            vent this, the other thing can be hindered. <note type="footnote"> 8 Et quid opus Cratero magnos promittere montes ? Persius, iii. 65. <lb/>

            walk on a rope; and not only difficult, but it is also dan­ <lb/>
            gerous. Ought we for this reason to practise walking on <lb/>
            a rope, or setting up a palm tree,1 or embracing statues? <lb/>
            By no means. Every thing which is difficult and dan­ <lb/>
            gerous is not suitable for practice; but that is suitable <lb/>
            which conduces to the working out of that which is pro­ <lb/>
            posed to us. And what is that which is proposed to <lb/>
            us as a thing to be worked out? To live with desire <lb/>
            and aversion (avoidance of certain things) free from re­ <lb/>
            straint. And what is this? Neither to be disappointed in <lb/>
            that which you desire, nor to fall into any thing which <lb/>
            you would avoid. Towards this object then exercise <lb/>
            (practice) ought to tend. For since it is not possible to <lb/>
            have your desire not disappointed and your aversion free <lb/>
            from falling into that which you would avoid, without <lb/>
            great and constant practice, you must know that if you <lb/>
            allow your desire and aversion to turn to things which <lb/>
            are not within the power of the will, you will neither <lb/>
            have your desire capable of attaining your object, nor <lb/>
            your aversion free from the power of avoiding that which <lb/>
            you would avoid. And since strong habit leads (prevails), <lb/>
            and we are accustomed to employ desire and aversion only <lb/>
            to things which are not within the power of our will, wo <lb/>
            ought to oppose to this habit a contrary habit, and where <lb/>
            there is great slipperiness in the appearances, there to <lb/>
            oppose the habit of exercise.</p>
          <p>I am rather inclined to pleasure: I will incline to the <lb/>
            contrary side2 above measure for the sake of exercise. I <note type="footnote"> 1 " To set up a palm tree." He docs not mean a real palm tree, but <lb/>

            the appearances which are presented to me for the purpose <lb/>
            of withdrawing my aversion from every such thing. For <lb/>
            who is a practitioner in exercise ? He who practises not <lb/>
            using his desire, and applies his aversion only to things <lb/>
            which are within the power of his will, and practises <lb/>
            most in the things which are difficult to conquer. For <lb/>
            this reason one man must practise himself more against <lb/>
            one thing and another against another thing. What then <lb/>
            is it to the purpose to set up a palm tree, orto carry about <lb/>
            a tent of skins, or a mortar and postle? 3 Practise, man, <lb/>
            if you are irritable, to endure if you are abused, not <lb/>
            to be vexed if you are treated with dishonour. Then you <lb/>
            will make so much progress that, even if a man strikes you <lb/>
            you will say to yourself, Imagine that you have embraced <lb/>
            a, statue: then also exercise yourself to use wine properly <lb/>
            so as not to drink much, for in this also there are men <lb/>
            who foolishly practise themselves; but first of all you <lb/>
            should abstain from it, and abstain from a young girl and <lb/>
            dainty cakes. Then at last, if occasion presents itself, for <lb/>
            the purpose of trying yourself at a proper time you will <lb/>
            descend into the arena to know if appearances overpower <lb/>
            you as they did formerly. But at first fly far from that <lb/>
            which is stronger than yourself: the contest is unequal <lb/>
            between a charming young girl and a beginner in philo­ <lb/>

            you do nothing out of season or place, or contrary to any <lb/>

            body by those who exercise it, if they tend in any way <lb/>
            towards desire and aversion, they also may be fit means <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>SOLITUDE is a certain condition of a helpless man. For <lb/>
            because a man is alone, he is not for that reason also soli­ <lb/>
            tary ; just as though a man is among numbers, he is not <lb/>
            therefore not solitary. When then we have lost either a <lb/>
            brother, or a son or a friend on whom we were accustomed <lb/>
            to repose, we say that we are left solitary, though we are <lb/>
            often in Rome, though such a crowd meet us, though so, <lb/>
            many live in the same place, and sometimes we have a <lb/>
            great number of slaves. For the man who is solitary, as <note type="footnote"> 6See i. 26, 18, and iii. 2, 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Polybius vi. 36. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Schweighaeuser refers to Arrian's Expedition of Alexander (vi. <lb/>
            26) for such an instance of Alexander's abstinence. There was an <lb/>

            It is conceived, is considered to be a helpless person and <lb/>
            exposed to those who wish to harm him. For this reason <lb/>
            when we travel, then especially do we say that we are <lb/>
            lonely when we fall among robbers, for it is not the sight <lb/>
            of a human creature which removes us from solitude, but <lb/>
            the sight of one who is faithful and modest and helpful <lb/>
            to us. For if being alone is enough to make solitude, you <lb/>
            may say that even Zeus is solitary in the conflagration 1 <lb/>
            and bewails himself saying, Unhappy that I am who have <lb/>
            neither Hera, nor Athena, nor Apollo, nor brother, nor son, <lb/>
            nor descendant nor kinsman. This is what some say that <lb/>
            he does when he is alone at the conflagration.2 For they <lb/>
            do not understand how a man parses his life when he is <lb/>

            love and from the pleasure of conversation among men. <lb/>
            But none the less a man ought to be prepared in a manner <lb/>
            for this also (being alone), to be able to be sufficient for <lb/>
            himself and to be his own companion. For as Zeus dwells <lb/>
            with himself, and is tranquil by himself, and thinks of his <lb/>
            own administration and of its nature, and is employed in <lb/>
            thoughts suitable to himself; so ought we also to be able <lb/>
            to talk with ourselves, not to feel the want of others also, <lb/>
            not to be unprovided with the means of passing our time; <lb/>
            to observe the divine administration, and the relation of <note type="footnote"> 1 This was the doctrine of Heraclitus' that all things were com­ <lb/>

            it may appear to some persons, to suppose that the earth had a <lb/>
            beginning, is in a state of continual change, and will finally be <lb/>
            destroyed in some way, and have a new beginning. See Seneca, <lb/>
            Ep. 9 ' cum resoluto mundo. this in unum confusis, paulisper cessante <lb/>

            speaks of the possibility of it being filled up in 20,000 years, or less. <lb/>
            Modern speculators have only recently become bold enough to throw <lb/>
            aside the notion of the earth and the other bodies in space being <lb/>

            how these also can be cured and how removed; if any <lb/>
            things require improvement, to improve them according <lb/>
            to reason.</p>
          <p>For you see that Caesar appears to furnish us with great <lb/>
            peace, that there are no longer enemies nor battles nor <lb/>
            great associations of robbers nor of pirates, but we can <lb/>
            travel at every hour and sail from east to west. But can <lb/>
            Caesar give us security from fever also, can he from ship­ <lb/>
            wreck, from fire, from earthquake or from lightning ? well, <lb/>
            I will say, can he give us security against love ? He cannot. <lb/>
            From sorrow ? He cannot. From envy ? He cannot. In a <lb/>
            word then he cannot protect us from any of these things. <lb/>
            But the doctrine of philosophers promises to give us <lb/>
            security (peace) even against these things. And what <lb/>
            does it say ? Men, if you will attend to me, wherever you <lb/>
            are, whatever you are doing, you will not feel sorrow, nor <lb/>
            anger, nor compulsion, nor hindrance, but you will pass <lb/>
            your time without perturbations and free from every thing. <lb/>
            When a man has this peace, not proclaimed by Caesar, (for <lb/>
            how should he be able to proclaim it?), but by God through <lb/>
            reason, is he not content when he is alone ? when he sees <lb/>
            and reflects, Now no evil can happen to me ; for me there <lb/>
            is no robber, no earthquake, every thing is full of peace, <lb/>
            full of tranquillity: every way, every city, every meeting, <lb/>
            neighbour, companion is harmless. One person whose <lb/>
            business it is, supplies me with food;3 another with <lb/>
            raiment; another with perceptions, and preconceptions <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προλήψεις</foreign>). And if he does not supply what is necessary, <lb/>
            he (God) gives the signal for retreat, opens the door, and <lb/>
            says to you, Go. Go whither ? To nothing terrible, but to <lb/>

              a passage (iii. 24, 94) which appears to mean that the soul of man <lb/>

            quenched charcoal will quench the other, or the burning <lb/>
            charcoal will light that which is quenched. Since then <lb/>
            the danger is so great, we must cautiously enter into <lb/>
            such intimacies with those of the common sort, and <lb/>
            remember that it is impossible that a man can keep com­ <lb/>
            pany with one who is covered with soot without being <lb/>
            partaker of the soot himself. For what will you do <lb/>
            if a man speaks about gladiators, about horses, about <lb/>
            athletes, or what is worse about men ? Such a person is <lb/>
            bad, such a person is good : this was well done, this was <lb/>

            Socrates had who in all his social intercourse could lead <lb/>

            have this power ? It is therefore a necessary consequence <lb/>
            that you are carried about by the common kind of people.</p>
          <p>Why then are they more powerful than you ? Because <lb/>
            they utter these useless words from their real opinions: <lb/>
            but you utter your elegant words only from your lips; for <lb/>
            this reason they are without strength and dead, and it is <lb/>
            nauseous 1 to listen to your exhortations and your miser­ <lb/>
            able virtue, which is talked of every where (up and down). <lb/>
            In this way the vulgar have the advantage over you: for <lb/>
            every opinion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγμα</foreign>) is strong and invincible. Until then <lb/>

            inscribe on your minds in the school. Withdraw then <lb/>
            yourselves far from the sun so long as you have these <lb/>

            who have lingering diseases to a different country and a <lb/>
            different air; and they do right. Do you also introduce <lb/>
            other habits than those which you have : fix your opinions <lb/>
            and exercise yourselves in them. But you do not so: you <lb/>

          <p>WHEN you make any charge against Providence, consider, <lb/>

            In what ?-In money.—Yes, for he is superior to you in <lb/>
            this, that he flatters, is free from shame, and is watchful. <lb/>
            What is the wonder ? But see if he has the advantage <lb/>

            will not find it to be so; but wherein you are superior, <lb/>
            there you will find that you have the advantage. And I <lb/>
            once said to a man who was vexed because Philostorgus <lb/>
            was fortunate: Would you choose to lie with Sura?1— <note type="footnote"> 1 Upton suggests that Sura may be Palfurius (Juvenal, iv. 53), <unclear/> <lb/>

            May it never happen, he replied, that this day should <lb/>
            come ? Why then are you vexed, if he receives something <lb/>
            in return for that which he sells ; or how can you consider <lb/>
            him happy who acquires those things by such means as you <lb/>
            abominate; or what wrong does Providence, if he gives <lb/>
            the better things to the better men ? Is it not better to bo <lb/>
            modest than to be rich ?--He admitted this—Why are you <lb/>
            vexed then, man, when you possess the better thing? <lb/>
            Remember then always and have in readiness the truth, <lb/>
            that this is a law of nature, that the superior has an ad­ <lb/>
            vantage over the inferior in that in which he is superior; <lb/>
            and you will never be vexed.</p>
          <p>But my wife treats mo badly.- Well, if any man asks <lb/>
            you what this is, say, my wife treats me badly-Is there <lb/>

            nothing—[What is this? my father gives me nothing--Is <lb/>

            is an evil is something which must be added to it exter­ <lb/>
            nally, and falsely added. For this reason we must not get <lb/>

            But perhaps he will report that some person is dead. <lb/>
            What then is that to you? He may report that some <lb/>
            person speaks ill of you. What then is that to you? Or <lb/>

            the judge declares that you have committed an act of <lb/>
            impiety. And did not the judges (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκασται</foreign>) make the same <lb/>
            declaration against Socrates? Does it concern you that <lb/>
            the judge has made this declaration ? No. Why then do <lb/>
            you trouble yourself any longer about it? Your father <lb/>
            has a certain duty, and if he shall not fulfil it, he loses <lb/>
            the character of a father, of a man of natural affection, of <lb/>
            gentleness. Do not wish him to lose any thing else on <lb/>
            this account. For never does a man do wrong in one <lb/>
            thing, and suffer in another. On the other side it is your <lb/>
            duty to make your defence firmly, modestly, without <lb/>
            anger: but if you do not, you also lose the character of <lb/>
            a son, of a man of modest behavior, of generous character. <lb/>
            Well then, is the judge free from danger? No; but he <lb/>
            also is in equal danger. Why then are you still afraid of <lb/>
            his decision ? What have you to do with that which is <lb/>
            another man's evil ? It is your own evil to make a bad <lb/>
            defence: be on your guard against this only. But to be <lb/>
            condemned or not to be condemned, as that is the act of <lb/>
            another person, so it is the evil of another person. A cer­ <lb/>
            tain person threatens you. Me? No. He blames you. <lb/>
            Let him see how he manages his own affairs. He is going <lb/>

          <p>THE first difference between a common person (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ίδιώτης</foreign>) <lb/>
            and a philosopher is this: the common person says, Woe <lb/>
            to me for my little child, for my brother, for my father.1 <lb/>
            The philosopher, if he shall ever be compelled to say, Woe <lb/>
            to me, stops and says, ' but for myself.' For nothing <lb/>
            which is independent of the will can hinder or damage <note type="footnote"> I Compare ii. 5.4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            the will, and the will can only hinder or damage itself. <lb/>
            If then we ourselves incline in this direction, so as, when <lb/>
            we are unlucky, to blame ourselves and to remember <lb/>
            that nothing else is the cause of perturbation or loss of <lb/>
            tranquillity except our own opinion, I swear to you by <lb/>
            all the gods that we have made progress. But in the <lb/>
            present state of affairs we have gone another way from <lb/>
            the beginning. For example, while we were still children, <lb/>
            the nurse, if we ever stumbled through want of care, did <lb/>
            not chide us, but would beat the stone. But what did the <lb/>
            stone do ? Ought the stone to have moved on account of <lb/>
            your child's folly ? Again, if we find nothing to eat on <lb/>
            coming out of the bath, the paedagogue never checks our <lb/>
            appetite, but he flogs the cook. Man, did we make you <lb/>
            the paedagogue of the cook and not of the child ?2 Correct <lb/>
            the child, improve him. In this way even when we are <lb/>
            grown up we are like children. For he who is unmusical <lb/>
            is a child in music; he who is without letters is a child in <lb/>
            learning: he who is untaught, is a child in life.</p>

            even in respect to falsehood itself there is a good result, <lb/>
            the knowledge that it is falsehood. So it ought to be in <lb/>
            life also. Is health a good thing, and is sickness a bad <lb/>
            thing? No, man. But what is it? To be healthy, and <lb/>
            healthy in a right way, is good: to be healthy in a bad <lb/>
            way is bad ; so that it is possible to gain advantage even <lb/>

            advantage even from death, and is it not possible to gain <lb/>
            advantage from mutilation ? Do you think that Menoeceus <lb/>
            gained little by death?2 Could a man who says so, gain so <lb/>
            much as Menoeceus gained? Come, man, did he not main­ <lb/>
            tain the character of being a lover of his country, a man of <lb/>
            great mind, faithful, generous? And if he bad continued <lb/>

            not have gained the opposite ? would he not have gained <lb/>
            the name of coward, ignoble, a hater of his country, a man <lb/>
            who feared death?3 Well, do you think that he gained <lb/>
            little by dying ? I suppose not. But did the father of <lb/>
            Admetus4 gain much by prolonging his life so ignobly <lb/>
            and miserably? Did he not die afterwards? Cease, I <lb/>

            temper, does he not do me good ?-This is not knowing <lb/>
            how to gain an advantage from men. Is my neighbour <unclear/> <lb/>

            good disposition, ray moderation. Is my father bad ? Bad <lb/>
            to himself, but to me good. This is the rod of Hermes: <lb/>
            touch with it what you please, as the saying is, and it <lb/>
            will be of gold. I say not so: but bring what you please, <lb/>
            and I will make it good.6 Bring disease, bring death, <lb/>
            biing poverty, bring abuse, bring trial on capital charges: <lb/>
            all these things through the rod of Hermes shall be made <lb/>
            profitable. What will you do with death? Why, what <lb/>
            else than that it shall do you honour, or that it shall show <lb/>
            you by act through it,7 what a man is who follows the <lb/>
            will of nature ? What will you do with disease ? I will <lb/>
            show its nature, I will be conspicuous in it, I will be firm, <lb/>
            I will be happy, I will not flatter the physician, I will not <lb/>
            wish to die. What else do you seek? Whatever you <lb/>
            shall give me, I will make it happy, fortunate, honoured, <lb/>
            a thing which a man shall seek.</p>

            Epictetus in the matter of education; and some other remarks to the <lb/>
            same effect follow in this chapter. A man might justly say that we <lb/>
            have no clear notion of the purpose of education. A modern writer, <lb/>
            who seems to belong to the school of Epictetus says: " it cannot be <lb/>
            denied that in all schools of all kinds it ought to be the first and the <lb/>
            chief object to make children healthy, good, honest, and, if possible, <lb/>
            sensible men and women; and if this is not done in a reasonable <lb/>
            degree, I maintain that the education of these schools is good for <lb/>
            nothing—I do not propose to make children good and honest and wise <lb/>
            by precepts and dogmas and preaching, as you will see. They must <lb/>
            be made good and wise by a cultivation of the understanding, by the <lb/>
            practice of the discipline necessary for that purpose, and by the <lb/>
            example of him who governs, directs and instructs." Further, “ my <lb/>
            men and women teachers have something which the others have not: <lb/>
            they have a purpose, an end in their system of education; and what is <lb/>
            education ? What is human life without some purpose or end which <lb/>

            things are not done, man, in a careless way, nor just as <lb/>
            it may happen; but there must be a (fit) age and life <lb/>
            and God as a guide. You say, No. But no man sails <lb/>
            from a port without having sacrificed to the Gods and <lb/>
            invoked their help ; nor do men sow without having called <lb/>
            on Demeter; and shall a man who has undertaken so great <lb/>
            a work undertake it safely without the Gods? and shall <lb/>
            they who undertake this work come to it with success? <lb/>
            What else are you doing, man, than divulging the mys­ <lb/>
            teries? You say, there is a temple at Eleusis, and one <lb/>
            here also. There is an Hierophant at Eleusis,4 and I also <lb/>
            will make an Hierophant: there is a herald, and I will <lb/>
            establish a herald: there is a torchbearer at Eleusis, and <lb/>
            I also will establish a torchbearer; there are torches at <lb/>
            Eleusis, and I will have torches here. The words are <lb/>
            the same: how do the things done hero differ from those <lb/>
            done there ?-Most impious man, is there no difference? <lb/>
            these things are done both in due place and in due time; <lb/>
            and when accompanied with sacrifice and prayers, when a <lb/>
            man is first purified, and when he is disposed in his mind <lb/>
            to the thought that he is going to approach sacred rites <lb/>
            and antient rites. In this way the mysteries are useful, <lb/>
            in this way we come to the notion that all these things <lb/>
            were established by the antients for the instruction and <lb/>
            correction of life.5 But you publish and divulge them <lb/>
            out of time, out of place, without sacrifices, without purity; <lb/>
            you have not the garments which the hierophant ought to <lb/>
            have, nor the hair, nor the headdress, nor the voice, nor <lb/>
            the age; nor have you purified yourself as he has: but <lb/>
            you have committed to memory the words only, and you <lb/>
            say, Sacred are the words by themselves.6 <note type="footnote"> 4 There was a great temple of Demeter (Ceres) at Eleusis in Attica, <lb/>

            a man must have also a certain readiness and fitness for <lb/>
            this purpose, and a certain quality of body, and above all <lb/>
            things he must have God to advise him to occupy this <lb/>
            office, as God advised Socrates to occupy the place of one <lb/>
            who confutes error, Diogenes the office cf royalty and <lb/>
            reproof, and the office of teaching precepts. But you open <lb/>

            but where and how they should be applied, you know not <lb/>
            nor have you taken any trouble about it. See, that man <lb/>
            says, I too have salves for the eyes. Have you also the <note type="footnote"> 7 This is a view of the fitness of a teacher which, as far as I know, <lb/>
            is quite new; and it is also true. Perhaps there was some vague <lb/>
            notion of this kind in modern Europe at the time when teachers of <lb/>
            youths were only priests, and when it was supposed that their fitness <lb/>
            for the office of teacher was secured by their fitness for the office of <lb/>
            priest. In the present' Ordering of Deacons' in the Church of Eng­ <lb/>
            land, the person, who is proposed as a fit person to be a deacon, is <lb/>
            asked the following question by the bishop: ' Do you trust that you are <lb/>
            inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you this office and <lb/>
            ministration to serve God for the promotion of his glory and the edifying <lb/>
            of his people?' 'In the ordering of Priests' this question is omitted, <lb/>
            and another question only is put, which is used also in the ordering <lb/>
            of Deacons; ‘ Do you think in your heart that you be truly called, <lb/>
            according to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ' etc. The teacher <lb/>
            ought to have God to advise him to occupy the office of teacher, as <lb/>
            Epictetus says. He does not say how God will advise: perhaps he <lb/>
            supposed that this advice might be given in the way in which Socrates <lb/>
            said that he received it. </note><note type="footnote"> ‘ Wisdom perhaps is not onough' to enable a man to take care of <lb/>
            youths. Whatever ‘ wisdom' may mean, it is true that a teacher <lb/>
            should have a fitness and liking for the business. If he has not, he <lb/>
            will find it disagreeable, and he will not do it well. He may and <lb/>
            ought to gain a reasonable living by his labour: if he seeks only <lb/>
            money and wealth, he is on the wrong track, and he is only like a <lb/>
            common dealer in buying and selling, a butcher or a shoemaker, or a <lb/>
            tailor, all useful members of society and all of them necessary in their <lb/>
            several kinds. But the teacher has a priestly office, the making, as <lb/>
            far as it is possible, children into good men and women. Should he <lb/>
            be ‘ ordered' like a Deacon or a Priest, for his office is even more useful <lb/>
            than that of Priest or Deacon? Some will say that this is ridiculous. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WHEN one of his pupils inquired of Epictetus, and <unclear>he</unclear> was <lb/>
            a person who appeared to be inclined to Cynism, what <lb/>
            kind of person a Cynic ought to be and what was the <lb/>
            notion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόληψιζ</foreign>) of the thing, we will inquire, said Epic­ <lb/>
            tetus, at leisure: but I have so much to say to you that <lb/>
            he who without God attempts so great a matter, is hateful <lb/>
            to God, and has no other purpose than to act indecently <lb/>
            in public. For in any well-managed house no man comes <lb/>
            forward, and says to himself, I ought to be manager of <lb/>
            the house. If he does so, the master turns round, and <lb/>
            seeing him insolently giving orders, drags him forth and <lb/>
            flogs him. So it is also in this great city (the world); <lb/>
            for here also there is a master of the house who orders <lb/>
            every thing. (He says) You are the sun; you can by <lb/>
            going round make the year and seasons, and make the <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            traits grow and nourish them, and stir the winds and <lb/>
            make them remit, and warm the bodies of men properly : <lb/>
            go, travel round, and so administer things from the greatest <lb/>
            to the least. You are a calf; when a lion shall appear, <lb/>
            do your proper business (i.e. run away): if you do not, <lb/>
            you will suffer. You are a bull: advance and fight, for <lb/>
            this is your business, and becomes you, and you can do it. <lb/>
            You can lead the army against Ilium; be Agamemnon. <lb/>
            You can fight in single combat against Hector: be <lb/>
            Achilles. But if Thersites1 came forward and claimed <lb/>
            the command, he would either not have obtained it; or <lb/>
            if he did obtain it, he would have disgraced himself <lb/>
            before many witnesses.</p>
          <p>Do you also think about the matter carefully: it is not <lb/>
            what it seems to you. (You say) I wear a cloak now <lb/>
            and I shall wear it then: I sleep hard now, and I shall <lb/>
            sleep hard then: I will take in addition a little bag now <lb/>
            and a staff, and I will go about and begin to beg and to <lb/>
            abuse those whom I meet; and if I see any man plucking <lb/>
            the hair out of his body, I will rebuke him, or if he has <lb/>
            dressed his hair, or if ho walks about in purple-If you <lb/>
            imagine the thing to be such as this, keep far away from <lb/>
            it: do not approach it: it is not at all for you. But if <lb/>
            you imagine it to be what it is, and do not think your­ <lb/>
            self to be unfit for it, consider what a great thing you <lb/>
            undertake.</p>
          <p>In the first place in the things which relate to yourself, <lb/>
            you must not bo in any respect like what you do now: <lb/>
            you must not blame God or man: you must take away <lb/>
            desire altogether, you must transfer avoidance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔκκλισις</foreign>) <lb/>
            only to the things which are within the power of the will: <lb/>
            you must not feel anger nor resentment nor envy nor pity; <lb/>
            a girl must not appear handsome to you, nor must you <lb/>
            love a little reputation, nor be pleased with a boy or a <lb/>
            cake. For you ought to know that the rest of men throw <lb/>
            walls around them and houses and darkness when they <lb/>
            do any such things, and they have many means of con­ <lb/>
            cealment. A man shuts the door, he sets somebody before <note type="footnote"> 1 See the description of Thersites in the Iliad, ii. 212. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            the chamber: if a person comes, say that he is out, he is <lb/>
            not at leisure. But the Cynic instead of all these things <lb/>
            must use modesty as his protection: if he does not, he <lb/>
            will be indecent in his nakedness and under the open sky. <lb/>
            This is his house, his door: this is the slave before his <lb/>
            bedchamber: this is his darkness. For he ought not to <lb/>
            wish to hide any thing that he does : and if he does, he <lb/>
            is gone, he has lost the character of a Cynic, of a man <lb/>
            who lives under the open sky, of a free man: he has <lb/>
            begun to fear some external thing, he has begun to have <lb/>
            need of concealment, nor can he get concealment when <lb/>
            he chooses. For where shall he hide himself and how? <lb/>
            And if by chance this public instructor shall be detected, <lb/>
            this paedagogue, what kind of things will he be compelled <lb/>
            to suffer ? when then a man fears these things, is it pos­ <lb/>
            sible for him to be bold with his whole soul to superintend <lb/>
            men ? It cannot be: it is impossible.</p>
          <p>In the first place then you must make your ruling <lb/>
            faculty pure, and this mode of life also. Now (you should <lb/>
            say), to mo the matter to work on is my understanding, <lb/>
            as wood is to the carpenter, as hides to the shoemaker; <lb/>
            and my business is the right use of appearances. But the <lb/>
            body is nothing to me : the parts of it are nothing to me. <lb/>
            Death ? Let it come when it chooses, either death of the <lb/>
            whole or of a part. Fly, you say. And whither; can <lb/>
            any man eject me out of the world? He cannot. But <lb/>
            wherever I go, there is the sun, there is the moon, there <lb/>
            are the stars, dreams, omens, and the conversation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμιλία</foreign>) <lb/>
            with Gods.</p>
          <p>Then, if he is thus prepared, the true Cynic cannot be <lb/>
            satisfied with this; but he must know that he is sent a <lb/>
            messenger from Zeus to men about good and bad things,2 to <lb/>
            show them that they have wandered and are seeking the <lb/>
            substance of good and evil where it is not, but where it <lb/>
            is, they never think ; and that he is a spy, as Diogenes3 <lb/>
            was carried off to Philip after the battle of Chaeroneia as <lb/>
            a spy. For in fact a Cynic is a spy of the things which <note type="footnote"> 2 The office which in our times corresponds to this description of the <lb/>
            Cynic, is the office of a teacher of religion. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 See i. 24, note 4. </note> <lb/>

            are good for men and which are evil, and it is his duty to <lb/>
            examine carefully and to come and report truly, and not <lb/>
            to be struck with terror so as to point out as enemies <lb/>
            those who are not enemies, nor in any other way to be <lb/>
            perturbed by appearances nor confounded.</p>
          <p>It is his duty then to be able with a loud voice, if the <lb/>
            occasion should arise, and appearing on the tragic stage <lb/>
            to say like Socrates : Men, whither are you hurrying, what <lb/>
            are you doing, wretches ? like blind people you are wan­ <lb/>
            dering up and down : you are going by another road, and <lb/>
            have left the true road: you seek for prosperity and hap­ <lb/>
            piness where they are not, and if another shows you where <lb/>
            they are, you do not believe him. Why do you seek it <lb/>
            without ? 4 In the body ? It is not there. If you doubt, <lb/>
            look at Myro, look at Ophellius,5 In possessions? It <lb/>
            is not there. But if you do not believe me, look at <lb/>
            Croesus: look at those who are now rich, with what <lb/>
            lamentations their life is filled. In power? It is not <lb/>
            there. If it is, those must be happy who have been twice <lb/>
            and thrice consuls; but they are not. Whom shall we <lb/>
            believe in these matters? You who from without see their <lb/>
            affairs and are dazzled by an appearance, or the men <lb/>
            themselves ? What do they say ? Hear them when they <lb/>
            groan, when they grieve, when on account of these very <lb/>
            consulships and glory and splendour they think that they <lb/>
            arc more wretched and in greater danger. Is it in royal <lb/>
            power? It is not: if it were, Nero would have been <lb/>
            happy, and Sardanapalus. But neither was Agamemnon <note type="footnote"> 4 Quod petis hie est, <lb/>

          <p>Wretch, which of your affairs goes badly? Your posses­ <lb/>
            sions? No. Your body? No. But you are rich in gold <lb/>
            and copper. What then is the matter with you ? That <lb/>
            part of you, whatever it is, has been neglected by you <lb/>
            and is corrupted, the part with which we desire, with <lb/>
            which we avoid, with which we move towards and <lb/>
            move from things. How neglected? He knows not <lb/>
            the nature of good for which he is made by nature and <lb/>
            the nature of evil; and what is his own, and what be­ <lb/>
            longs to another; and when any thing that belongs to <lb/>
            others goes badly, he says, Wo to me, for the Hellenes <lb/>
            are in danger. Wretched is his ruling faculty, and alone <lb/>
            neglected and uncared for. The Hellenes are going to <lb/>
            die destroyed by the Trojans. And if the Trojans do <lb/>
            not kill them, will they not die ? Yes; but not all at <lb/>
            once. What difference then does it make ? For if death <lb/>
            is an evil, whether men die altogether, or if they die <lb/>
            singly, it is equally an evil. Is any thing else then going <lb/>
            to happen than the separation of the soul and the body ? 6 <lb/>
            Nothing. And if the Hellenes perish, is the door closed, <lb/>
            and is it not in your power to die ? It is. Why then do <lb/>
            you lament (and say) Oh, you who are a king and have <lb/>
            the sceptre of Zeus ? An unhappy king does not exist <lb/>

            Tell us, you who are lord, messenger and spy. Where <lb/>
            you do not think that it is, nor choose to seek it: for if <lb/>
            you chose to seek it, you would have found it to be in <lb/>
            yourselves; nor would you be wandering out of the way, <lb/>
            nor seeking what belongs to others as if it were your own. <lb/>
            Turn your thoughts into yourselves : observe the precon­ <lb/>
            ceptions which you have. What kind of a thing do you <lb/>
            imagine the good to be ? That which flows easily, that <lb/>
            which is happy, that which is not impeded. Come, and <lb/>
            do you not naturally imagine it to be great, do you not <lb/>
            imagine it to be valuable ? do you not imagine it to be <lb/>
            free from harm? In what material then ought you to <lb/>
            seek for that which flows easily, for that which is not im­ <lb/>
            peded ? in that which serves or in that which is free ? In <lb/>
            that which is free. Do you possess the body then free or <lb/>
            is it in servile condition ? We do not know. Do you not <lb/>
            know that it is the slave of fever, of gout, ophthalmia, <lb/>
            dysentery, of a tyrant, of fire, of iron, of every thing <lb/>
            which is stronger? Yes, it is a slave. How then is it <lb/>
            possible that any thing which belongs to the body can be <lb/>
            free from hindrance ? and how is a thing great or valuable <lb/>
            which is naturally dead, or earth, or mud ? Well then, do <lb/>
            you possess nothing which is free? Perhaps nothing. <lb/>
            And who is able to compel you to assent to that which <lb/>
            appears false ? No man. And who can compel you not <lb/>
            to assent to that which appears true ? No man. By this <lb/>
            then you see that there is something in you naturally free. <lb/>
            But to desire or to be averse from, or to move towards an <lb/>
            object or to move from it, or to prepare yourself, or to <lb/>

            he has received an impression of the appearance of that <lb/>
            which is profitable or a duty ? No man. You have then <lb/>
            in these things also something which is not hindered and <lb/>
            is free. Wretched men, work out this, take care of this, <lb/>

          <p>And how is it possible that a man who has nothing, <lb/>
            who is naked, houseless, without a hearth, squalid, without <lb/>
            a slave, without a city, can pass a life that flows easily ? <lb/>
            See, God has sent you a man to show you that it is pos <lb/>
            sible.7 Look at me, who am without a city, without a <lb/>
            house, without possessions, without a slave; I sleep on <lb/>
            the ground; I have no wife, no children, no praetorium, <lb/>
            but only the earth and heavens, and one poor cloak. And <lb/>
            what do I want ? Am I not without sorrow ? am I not <lb/>
            without fear ? Am I not free ? W hen did any of you see <lb/>
            me failing in the object of my desire ? or ever falling into <lb/>
            that which I would avoid ? did I ever blame God or man ?8 <note type="footnote"> 7 " It is observable that Epictetus seems to think it a necessary <lb/>

            execute all that he had in hand. And is he who is trained <lb/>
            to the contest and exercised by Zeus going to call out and <lb/>
            to be vexed, he who is worthy to bear the sceptre of <lb/>
            Diogenes? Hear what Diogenes says to the passers by <lb/>
            when he is in a fever, Miserable wretches, will you not <lb/>
            stay ? but are you going so long a journey to Olympia to see <lb/>
            the destruction or the fight of athletes ; and will you not <lb/>
            choose to see the combat between a fever and a man ?12 <lb/>
            Would such a man accuse God who sent him down as if <lb/>
            God were treating him unworthily, a man who gloried in <note type="footnote"> 10 ‘ E caelo descendit <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνῶθι σεαυτόν</foreign>’ Juvenal xi. 27. The expression <lb/>

            that there was no comparison between them. For where <lb/>

          <p>When the young man asked, if when a Cynic has fallen <lb/>
            sick, and a friend asks him to come to his house and to be <lb/>
            taker care of in his sickness, shall the Cynic accept the <lb/>
            invitation, he replied, And where shall you find, I ask, a <lb/>
            Cynic's friend ?14 For the man who invites ought to be <lb/>
            such another as the Cynic that he may be worthy of being <lb/>
            reckoned the Cynic's friend. He ought to be a partner in <lb/>
            the Cynic's sceptre and his royalty, and a worthy minister, <lb/>
            if he intends to be considered worthy of a Cynic's friend­ <lb/>
            ship, as Diogenes was a friend of Antisthenes, as Crates <lb/>
            was a friend of Diogenes. Do you think that if a man <lb/>
            comes to a Cynic and salutes him, that he is the Cynic's <lb/>
            friend, and that the Cynic will think him worthy of <lb/>
            receiving a Cynic into his house ? So that if you please,15 <lb/>
            reflect on this also: rather look round for some convenient <lb/>

            man's house and to be well fed there for a time. Why <lb/>
            then do you think of attempting so great a thing (as the <lb/>

          <p>But, said the young man, shall marriage and the pro­ <lb/>
            creation of children as a chief duty be undertaken by the <lb/>
            Cynic?16 If you grant me a community of wise men, <lb/>
            Epictetus replies, perhaps no man will readily apply <lb/>
            himself to the Cynic practice. For on whose account <lb/>
            should he undertake this manner of life ? However if we <lb/>
            suppose that he does, nothing will prevent him from <lb/>
            marrying and begetting children; for his wife will be <lb/>
            another like himself, and his father in Jaw another like <lb/>
            himself, and his children will be brought up like him­ <lb/>
            self. But in the present state of things which is like <lb/>
            that of an army placed in battle order, is it not fit that <lb/>
            the Cynic should without any distraction be employed only <lb/>
            on the ministration of God,17 able to go about among men, <note type="footnote"> 16 The Stoics recommended marriage, the procreation of children, <lb/>
            the discharge of magisterial offices, and the duties of social life <lb/>
            generally. </note><note type="footnote"> 17 "It is remarkable that Epictetus here uses the same word <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπερισπάστως</foreign>) with St. Paul, 1 Cor. vii. 35, and urges the same con­ <lb/>
            sideration, of applying wholly to the service of God, to dissuade from <lb/>
            marriage. His observation too that the state of things was then <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς ἐν παρατάξει</foreign>) like that of an army prepared for battle, nearly re­ <lb/>
            sembles the Apostle's (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνεστῶσα ἀνάγκη</foreign>) present necessity. St. Paul <lb/>
            says 2 Tim. ii. 4 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεὶς στρατευόμενος ἐμπλέκεται</foreign> etc.) no man that <lb/>
            warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of life. So Epictetus says <lb/>
            here that a Cynic must not be (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμπεπλεγμένον</foreign>) in relations etc. From <lb/>
            these and many other passages of Epictetus one would be inclined to <lb/>
            think that he was not unacquainted with St. Paul's Epistles or that <lb/>
            he had heard something of the Christian doctrine." Mrs. Carter. </note><note type="footnote"> I do not find any evidence of Epictetus being acquaint d with the <lb/>
            Epistles of Paul. It is possible that he had heard something of the <lb/>
            Christian doctrine, but I have not observed any evidence of the fact. <lb/>
            Epictetus and Paul have not the same opinion about marriage, for <lb/>
            Paul says that' if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better <lb/>
            to marry than to burn.’ Accordingly his doctrine is ‘to avoid fornica­ <lb/>
            tion let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her <lb/>
            own husband.' He does not directly say what a man should do when <lb/>
            he is not able to maintain a wife; but the inference is plain what he <lb/>
            will do (1 Cor. vii. 2). Paul's view of marriage differs from that of <lb/>
            Epictetus, who recommends marriage. Paul does not: he writes, ‘ I <lb/>
            say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they <lb/>
            abide even as I.’ He does not acknowledge marriage and the beget­ <lb/>
            ting of children as a duty; which Epictetus did. </note><note type="footnote"> In the present condition of the world Epictetus says that the <lb/>
            'minister of God' should not marry, because the cares of a family <lb/>
            would distract him and make him unable to discharge his duties. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            not tied down to the common duties of mankind, nor <lb/>
            entangled in the ordinary relations of life, which if he <lb/>
            neglects, he will not maintain the character of an honour­ <lb/>
            able and good man? and if he observes them he will lose <lb/>
            the character of the messenger, and spy and herald of God. <lb/>
            For consider that it is his duty to do something towards <lb/>
            his father in law, something to the other kinsfolks of his <lb/>
            wife, something to his wife also (if he has one). He is <lb/>
            also excluded by being a Cynic from looking after the <lb/>
            sickness of his own family, and from providing for their <lb/>
            support. And to say nothing of the rest, he must have a <lb/>
            vessel for heating water for the child that he may wash <lb/>
            it in the bath; wool for his wife when she is delivered of <lb/>
            a child, oil, a bed, a cup : so the furniture of the house is <lb/>
            increased. I say nothing of his other occupations, and of <lb/>
            his distraction. Where then now is that king, he who <lb/>
            devotes himself to the public interests, <lb/>
            The people's guardian and so full of cares. <lb/>
            Homer, Iliad ii. 25 <lb/>
            whose duty it is to look after others, the married and <lb/>
            those who have children; to see who uses his wife well, <lb/>
            who uses her badly; who quarrels; what family is well <lb/>
            administered, what is not; going about as a physician <lb/>
            does and feels pulses? He says to one, you have a fever, <lb/>
            to another you have a head-ache, or the gout: he says to <lb/>
            one, abstain from food;18 to another he says, eat; or do <lb/>
            not use the bath; to another, you require the knife, or the <lb/>
            cautery. How can he have time for this who is tied to <lb/>
            the duties of common life ? is it not his duty to supply <lb/>
            clothing to his children, and to send them to the school.. <lb/>
            master with writing tablets, and styles (for writing).19 <lb/>
            Besides must he not supply them with beds? for they <note type="footnote"> There is sound sense in this. A ‘ minister cf God' should not be dis­ <lb/>

            cannot be genuine Cynics as soon as they are born. If he <lb/>
            does not do this, it would be better to expose the children <lb/>
            as soon as they are born than to kill them in this way. <lb/>
            Consider what we are bringing the Cynic down to, how <lb/>
            we are taking his royalty from him.—Yes, but Crates <lb/>
            took a wife.—You are speaking of a circumstance which <lb/>
            arose from love and of a woman who was another Crates.20 <lb/>
            But we are inquiring about ordinary marriages and those <lb/>
            which are free from distractions,21 and making this inquiry <lb/>
            we do not find the affair of marriage in this state of the <lb/>
            world a thing which is especially suited to the Cynic.</p>
          <p>How then shall a man maintain the existence of society? <lb/>
            In the name of God, are those men greater benefactors to <lb/>
            society who introduce into the world to occupy their own <lb/>
            places two or three grunting children,22 or those who super­ <lb/>
            intend as far as they can all mankind, and see what they do, <lb/>
            how they live, what they attend to, what they neglect con­ <lb/>
            trary to their duty ? Did they who left little children to the <lb/>
            Thebans do them more good than Epaminondas who died <lb/>
            childless? And did Priamus who begat fifty worthless <lb/>
            sons or Danaus or Aeolus contribute more to the com­ <lb/>
            munity than Homer ? then shall the duty of a general or <lb/>
            the business of a writer exclude a man from marriage or <lb/>
            the begetting of children, and such a man shall not be <lb/>
            judged to have accepted the condition of childlessness for <lb/>
            nothing; and shall not the royalty of a Cynic be considered <lb/>
            an equivalent for the want of children ? Do we not per­ <lb/>
            ceive his grandeur and do wo not justly contemplate the <lb/>
            character of Diogenes ; and do we instead of this turn our <lb/>
            eyes to the present Cynics who are dogs that wait at tables, <lb/>
            and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance <lb/>
            in breaking wind, but in nothing else ? For such matters <lb/>
            would not have moved us at all nor should we have <lb/>
            wondered if a Cynic should not marry or beget children. <note type="footnote"> 20 The wife of Crates was Hipparchia, who persisted against all <lb/>

            Man, the Cynic is the father of all men; the men are his <lb/>
            sons, the women are his daughters: he so carefully visits <lb/>
            all, so well does he care for all. Do you think that it is <lb/>
            from idle impertinence that he rebukes those whom he <lb/>
            meets ? He does it as a father, as a brother, and as the <lb/>
            minister of the father of all, the minister of Zeus.</p>
          <p>If you please, ask me also if a Cynic shall engage in the <lb/>
            administration of the state. Fool, do you seek a greater <lb/>
            form of administration than that in which he is engaged ? <lb/>
            Do you ask if he shall appear among the Athenians and <lb/>
            say something about the revenues and the supplies, he <lb/>
            who must talk with all men, alike with Athenians, alike <lb/>
            with Corinthians, alike with Romans, not about supplies, <lb/>
            nor yet about revenues, nor about peace or war, but about <lb/>
            happiness and unhappiness, about good fortune and bad <lb/>
            fortune, about slavery and freedom? When a man has <lb/>
            undertaken the administration of such a state, do you ask <lb/>
            me if he shall engage in the administration of a state ? ask <lb/>
            me also if he shall govern (hold a magisterial office): again <lb/>
            I will say to you, Fool, what greater government shall he <lb/>
            exercise than that which he exercises now ?</p>
          <p>It is necessary also for such a man (the Cynic) to have a <lb/>
            certain habit of body: for if he appears to be consumptive, <lb/>
            thin and pale, his testimony has not then the same weight. <lb/>
            For he must not only by showing the qualities of the soul <lb/>
            prove to the vulgar that it is in his power independent of the <lb/>
            things which they admire to be a good man, but he must <lb/>
            also show by his body that his simple and frugal way of <lb/>
            living in the open air does not injure even the body. See, <lb/>
            he says, I am a proof of this, and my own body also is. <lb/>
            So Diogenes used to do, for he used to go about fresh <lb/>
            looking, and he attracted the notice of the many by his <lb/>
            personal appearance. But if a Cynic is an object of com­ <lb/>
            passion, he seems to be a beggar: all persons turn away <lb/>
            from him, all are offended with him; for neither ought he <lb/>
            to appear dirty so that he shall not also in this respect <lb/>
            drive away men; but his very roughness ought to be clean <lb/>
            and attractive.</p>
          <p>There ought also to belong to the Cynic much natural <lb/>
            grace and sharpness ; and if this is not so, he is a stupid <lb/>
            fellow, and nothing else; and he must have these qualities <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            that he may be able readily and fitly to be a match for all <lb/>
            circumstances that may happen. So Diogenes replied to <lb/>
            one who said, Are you the Diogenes who does not believe <lb/>
            that there are gods?23 And, how, replied Diogenes, can <lb/>
            this be when I think that you are odious to the gods? <lb/>
            On another occasion in reply to Alexander, who stood <lb/>
            by him when he was sleeping, and quoted Homer's lino <lb/>
            (Iliad, ii. 24) <lb/>
            A man a councillor should not sleep all night, <lb/>
            he answered, when he was half asleep, <lb/>
            The people's guardian and so full of cares.</p>
          <p>But before all the Cynic's ruling faculty must be purer <lb/>
            than the sun; and if it is not, he must necessarily be a <lb/>
            cunning knave and a fellow of no principle, since while he <lb/>
            himself is entangled in some vice he will reprove others.24 <lb/>
            For see how the matter stands: to these kings and tyrants <lb/>
            their guards and arms give the power of reproving some <lb/>
            persons, and of being able even to punish those who do <lb/>
            wrong though they are themselves bad; but to a Cynic <lb/>
            instead of arms and guards it is conscience (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ συνειδός</foreign>) <lb/>
            which gives this power. When he knows that he has <lb/>
            watched and laboured for mankind, and has slept pure, <lb/>
            and sleep has left him still purer, and that he thought <lb/>
            whatever he has thought as a friend of the gods, as a <lb/>
            minister, as a participator of the power of Zeus, and that <lb/>
            on all occasions he is ready to say <lb/>
            Lead me, 0 Zeus, and thou, 0 Destiny<unclear/>;25 <lb/>
            and also, If so it pleases the gods, so let it be; why should <lb/>
            he not have confidence to speak freely to his own brothers, <lb/>
            to his children, in a word to his kinsmen ? For this reason <lb/>

            this state of mind; for he is not a meddler with the affairs <lb/>
            of others when he is superintending human affaiis, but he <lb/>
            is looking after his own affairs. If that is not so, you may <lb/>
            also say that the general is a busybody, when he inspects <lb/>
            his soldiers, and examines them and watches them and <lb/>
            punishes the disorderly. But if while you have a cake <lb/>
            under your arm, you rebuke others, I will say to you, <lb/>
            Will you not rather go away into a comer and eat that <lb/>
            which you have stolen; what have you to do with the <lb/>
            affairs of others ? For who are you ? are you the bull of <lb/>
            the herd, or the queen of the bees ? Show me the tokens <lb/>
            of your supremacy, such as they have from nature. But if <lb/>
            you are a drone claiming the sovereignty over the bees, do <lb/>
            you not suppose that your fellow citizens will put you <lb/>
            down as the bees do the drones?</p>
          <p>The Cynic also ought to have such power of endurance <lb/>
            as to seem insensible to the common sort and a stone: no <lb/>
            man reviles him, no man strikes him, no man insults him, <lb/>
            but he gives his body that any man who chooses may do <lb/>
            with it what he likes. For he bears in mind that the <lb/>
            inferior must be overpowered by the superior in that in <lb/>
            which it is inferior; and the body is inferior to the many, <lb/>
            the weaker to the stronger. He never then descends into <lb/>
            such a contest in which he can be overpowered; but he <lb/>
            immediately withdraws from things which belong to <lb/>
            others, he claims not the things which are servile. But <lb/>
            where there is will and the use of appearances, there you <lb/>
            will see how many eyes he has so that you may say, Argus <lb/>
            was blind compared with him. Is his assent ever hasty, <lb/>
            his movement (towards an object) rash, does his desire <lb/>
            ever fail in its object, does that which he would avoid <lb/>
            befal him, is his purpose unaccomplished, does he ever find <lb/>
            fault, is he ever humiliated, is he ever envious ? To these <lb/>
            he directs all his attention and energy; but as to every <lb/>
            thing else he snores supine. All is peace; there is no <lb/>
            robber who takes away his will, no tyrant. But what <lb/>
            say you as to his body ? I say there is. And his possessions ? <lb/>
            I say there is. And as to magistracies and honours?- <lb/>
            What does he care for them ?- When then any person would <note type="footnote"> <unclear>26</unclear> This is quoted by M. Antoninus, xi. 86. </note> <lb/>

          <p>About such a matter as this you are deliberating. <lb/>
            Therefore, if you please, I urge you in God's name, defer <lb/>
            the matter, and first consider your preparation for it. For <lb/>

          <p>FIRST say to yourself Who you wish to be: then do <lb/>
            accordingly what you are doing; for in nearly all other <lb/>
            things we see this to be so. Those who follow athletic <lb/>
            exercises first determine what they wish to be, then they <lb/>
            do accordingly what follows. If a man is a runner in <lb/>
            the long course, there is a certain kind of diet, of <lb/>
            walking, rubbing, and exercise: if a man is a runner <lb/>
            in the stadium, all these things are different; if he is a <lb/>
            Pentathlete, they are still more different. So you will <lb/>
            find it also in the arts. If you are a carpenter, you will <lb/>
            have such and such things: if a worker in metal, such <lb/>
            things. For every thing that we do, if we refer it to no <lb/>
            end, we shall do it to no purpose; and if we refer it to <note type="footnote"> 1 Epictetus in an amusing manner touches on the practice of <lb/>
            Sophists, Rhetoricians, and others, who made addresses only to get <lb/>
            praise. This practice of reciting prose or verse compositions was <lb/>
            common in the time of Epictetus, as we may learn from the letters of <lb/>
            the younger Pliny, Juvenal, Martial, and the author of the treatise do <lb/>

            the wrong end, we shall miss the mark. Further, there <lb/>
            is a general end or purpose, and a particular purpose. <lb/>
            First of all, we must act as a man. What is compre­ <lb/>
            hended in this? We must not be like a sheep, though <lb/>
            gentle; nor mischievous, like a wild beast. But the <lb/>
            particular end has reference to each person's mode of life <lb/>
            and his will. The lute-player acts as a lute-player, the <lb/>
            carpenter as a carpenter, the philosopher as a philosopher, <lb/>
            the rhetorician as a rhetorician. When then you say, <lb/>
            Come and hear me read to you : take care first of all that <lb/>
            you are not doing this without a purpose; then if you <lb/>
            have discovered that you are doing this with reference to <lb/>
            a purpose, consider if it is the right purpose. Do you <lb/>
            wish to do good or to be praised? Immediately you hear <lb/>
            him saying, To me what is the value of praise from the <lb/>
            many? and he says well, for it is of no value to a <lb/>
            musician, so far as he is a musician, nor to a geome­ <lb/>
            trician. Do you then wish to be useful? in what? tell us <lb/>
            that we may run to your audience room. Now can a man <lb/>
            do anything useful to others, who has not received some­ <lb/>
            thing useful himself? No, for neither can a man do any <lb/>
            thing useful in the carpenter's art, unless he is a carpenter; <lb/>
            nor in the shoemaker's art, unless he is a shoemaker.</p>
          <p>Do you wish to know then if you have received any <lb/>
            advantage? Produce your opinions, philosopher. What <lb/>
            is the thing which desire promises ? Not to fail in the <lb/>
            object. What does aversion promise? Not to fall into <lb/>
            that which you would avoid. Well; do we fulfill their <lb/>
            promise ? Tell me the truth; but if you lie, I will tell <lb/>
            you. Lately when your hearers came together rather <lb/>
            coldly, and did not give you applause, you went away <lb/>
            humbled. Lately again when you had been praised, you <lb/>
            went about and said to all, What did you think of me ? <lb/>
            Wonderful, master, I swear by all that is dear to me. But <lb/>
            how did I treat of that particular matter ? Which? The <lb/>
            passage in which I described Pan and the nymphs?2 Ex­ <lb/>
            cellently. Then do you tell me that in desire and in <lb/>
            aversion you are acting according to nature ? Be gone; <lb/>
            try to persuade somebody else. Did you not praise a cer- <note type="footnote"> 2 Such were the subjects which the literary men of the day do. <lb/>

            tain person contrary to your opinion? and did you not <lb/>
            flatter a certain person who was the son of a senator? <lb/>
            Would you wish your own children to be such persons?— I <lb/>
            hope not- Why then did you praise and flatter him ? He <lb/>
            is an ingenuous youth and listens well to discourses— <lb/>
            How is this? —He admires me. You have stated your <lb/>
            proof. Then what do you think? do not these very people <lb/>
            secretly despise you ? When then a man who is conscious <lb/>
            that he has neither done any good nor ever thinks of it, <lb/>
            finds a philosopher who says, You have a great natural <lb/>
            talent, and you have a candid and good disposition, what <lb/>
            else do you think that he says except this, This man has <lb/>
            some need of me ? Or tell me what act that indicates a <lb/>
            great mind has he shown ? Observe; he has been in your <lb/>
            company a long time; he has listened to your discourses, <lb/>
            he has heard you reading; has he become more modest? <lb/>
            has he been turned to reflect on himself? has he per­ <lb/>
            ceived in what a bad state he is ? has he cast away self- <lb/>
            conceit ? does he look for a person to teach him ? He does. <lb/>
            A man who will teach him to live? No, fool, but how to <lb/>
            talk; for it is for this that he admires you also. Listen <lb/>
            and hear what he says: This man writes with perfect <lb/>
            art, much better than Dion.3 This is altogether another <lb/>
            thing. Does he say, This man is modest, faithful, free <lb/>
            from perturbations ? and even if he did say it, I should <lb/>
            say to him, Since this man is faithful, tell me what this <lb/>
            faithful man is. And if he could not tell me, I should <lb/>
            add this, First understand what you say, and then speak.</p>
          <p>You then, who are in a wretched plight and gaping <lb/>
            after applause and counting your auditors, do you intend <lb/>
            to be useful to others ?-To-day many more attended my <lb/>
            discourse. Yes, many; we suppose five hundred. That <lb/>
            is nothing; suppose that there were a thousand — Dion <lb/>
            never had so many hearers — How could he?—And they <lb/>
            understand what is said beautifully. What is fine, master, <lb/>
            can move even a stone — See, these are the words of a <note type="footnote"> 3 Dion of Prusa in Bithynia was named Chrysostomus (golden­ <lb/>

            philosopher. This is the disposition of a man who will <lb/>
            do good to others; here is a man who has listened to dis­ <lb/>
            courses, who has read what is written about Socrates as <lb/>
            Socratic, not as the compositions of Lysias and Isocrates. <lb/>
            'I have often wondered by what arguments.ʼ4 Not so, <lb/>
            but ' by what argument': this is more exact than that — <lb/>
            What, have you read the words at all in a different way <lb/>
            from that in which you read little odes ? For if you read <lb/>
            them as you ought, you would not have been attending to <lb/>
            such matters, but you would rather have been looking to <lb/>
            these words: " Anytus and Melitus are able to kill me, <lb/>
            but they cannot harm me:" " and I am always of such a <lb/>
            disposition as to pay regard to nothing of my own except <lb/>
            to the reason which on inquiry seems to me the best, ”5 <lb/>
            Hence who ever heard Socrates say, “ I know something <lb/>
            and I teach;” but he used to send different people to <lb/>
            different teachers. Therefore they used to come to him <lb/>
            and ask to be introduced to philosophers by him; and he <lb/>
            would take them and recommend them. — Not so; but as <lb/>
            he accompanied them he would say, Hear me to-day dis­ <lb/>

            you? Do you wish to show me that you put words <lb/>
            together cleverly ? You put them together, man; and <lb/>
            what good will it do you ? — But only praise me.— What <lb/>
            do you mean by praising? — Say to me, admirable, won­ <lb/>
            derful.— Well, I say so. But if that is praise whatever <lb/>

            Quadratus is a Roman name. There appears to be a confusion <lb/>

            good, what have I to praise in you ? If it is good to speak <lb/>
            well, teach me, and I will praise you.— What then? <lb/>
            ought a man to listen to such things without pleasure ?— <lb/>
            I hope not. For my part I do not listen even to a lute- <lb/>
            player without pleasure. Must I then for this reason <lb/>
            stand and play the lute? Hear what Socrates says, Nor <lb/>
            would it be seemly for a man of my age, like a young <lb/>
            man composing addresses, to appear before you.8 Like a <lb/>
            young man, he says. For in truth this small art is an <lb/>
            elegant thing, to select words, and to put them together, <lb/>
            and to come forward and gracefully to read them or to <lb/>
            speak, and while he is reading to say, There are not <lb/>
            many who can do these things, I swear by all that you <lb/>
            value.</p>
          <p>Does a philosopher invite people to hear him ? As the <lb/>
            sun himself draws men to him, or as food does, does not <lb/>
            the philosopher also draw to him those who will receive <lb/>
            benefit ? What physician invites a man to be treated by <lb/>
            him? Indeed I now hear that even the physicians in <lb/>
            Rome do invite patients, but when I lived there, the <lb/>
            physicians were invited. I invite you to come and hear <lb/>
            that things are in a bad way for you, and that you are <lb/>
            taking care of every thing except that of which you ought <lb/>
            to take care, and that you are ignorant of the good and <lb/>
            the bad and are unfortunate and unhappy. A fine kind <lb/>
            of invitation: and yet if the words of the philosopher do <lb/>
            not produce this effect on you, he is dead, and so is the <lb/>
            speaker. Rufus was used to say: If you have leisure to <lb/>
            praise me, I am speaking to no purposed Accordingly <lb/>
            he used to speak in such a way that every one of us who <lb/>
            were sitting there supposed that some one had accused <lb/>
            him before Rufus: he so touched on what was doing, he <lb/>
            so placed before the eyes every man's faults.</p>
          <p>The philosopher's school, ye men, is a surgery: you <lb/>
            ought not to go out of it with pleasure, but with pain. <lb/>
            For you are not in sound health when you enter: one has <lb/>
            dislocated his shoulder, another has an abscess, a third a <lb/>
            fistula, and a fourth a head ache. Then do I sit and utter to <note type="footnote"> 8 From Plato's Apology of Socrates. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 Aulus Gellius v. 1. Seneca, Ep. 52. Upton. </note> <lb/>

            you little thoughts and exclamations that you may praise <lb/>
            me and go away, one with his shoulder in the same con­ <lb/>
            dition in which he entered, another with his head still <lb/>
            aching, and a third with his fistula or his abscess just as <lb/>
            they were ? Is it for this then that young men shall quit <lb/>
            home, and leave their parents and their friends and kins­ <lb/>
            men and property, that they may say to you, Wonderful! <lb/>
            when you are uttering your exclamations. Did Socrates <lb/>
            do this, or Zeno, or Cleanthes ?</p>
          <p>What then? is there not the hortatory style? Who <lb/>
            denies it? as there is the style of refutation, and the <lb/>
            didactic style. Who then ever reckoned a fourth style <lb/>
            with these, the style of display? What is the hortatory <lb/>
            style? To be able to show both to one person and to <lb/>
            many the struggle in which they are engaged, and that <lb/>
            they think more about any thing than about what they <lb/>
            really wish. For they wish the things which lead to hap­ <lb/>
            piness, but they look for them in the wrong place. In <lb/>
            order that this may be done, a thousand seats must be <lb/>
            placed and men must be invited to listen, and you must <lb/>
            ascend the pulpit in a fine robe or cloak and describe the <lb/>
            death of Achilles. Cease, I intreat you by the gods, to <lb/>
            spoil good words and good acts as much as you can. <lb/>
            Nothing can have more power in exhortation than when <lb/>
            the speaker shows to the hearers that he has need of <lb/>
            them. But tell me who when he hears you reading or <lb/>
            discoursing is anxious about himself or turns to reflect on <lb/>
            himself? or when he has gone out says, The philosopher <lb/>
            hit me well: I must no longer do these things. But does <lb/>
            he not, even if you have a great reputation, say to some <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THAT WE OUGH1 NOT TO BE MOVED BY A DESIRE OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE NOT IN OUR POWER.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>LET not that which in another is contrary to nature be <lb/>
            an evil to you: for you are not formed by nature to be <lb/>
            depressed with others nor to be unhappy with others, but <lb/>
            to be happy with them. If a man is unhappy, remember <lb/>
            that his unhappiness is his own fault: for God has made <lb/>
            all men to be happy, to be free from perturbations. For <lb/>
            this purpose he has given means to them, some things to <lb/>
            each person as his own, and other things not as his own : <lb/>
            some things subject to hindrance and compulsion and <lb/>
            deprivation; and these things are not a man's own: but <lb/>
            the things which are not subject to hindrances, are his <lb/>
            own; and the nature of good and evil, as it was fit to be <lb/>
            done by him who takes care of us and protects us like a <lb/>
            father, he has made our own,-But you say, I have parted <lb/>
            from a certain person, and he is grieved.- Why did he <lb/>
            consider as his own that which belongs to another ? why, <lb/>
            when he looked on you and was rejoiced, did he not also <lb/>
            reckon that you are mortal, that it is natural for you <lb/>
            to part from him for a foreign country? Therefore he <lb/>
            suffers the consequences of his own folly. But why do <lb/>
            you1 or for what purpose bewail yourself? Is it that you <lb/>
            also have not thought of these things? but, like poor <lb/>
            women who are good for nothing, you have enjoyed all <lb/>
            things in which you took pleasure, as if you would always <lb/>
            enjoy them, both places and men and conversation; and <lb/>
            now you sit and weep because you do not see the same <lb/>
            persons and do not live in the same places.—Indeed you <lb/>
            deserve this, to be more wretched than crows and ravens <lb/>
            who have the power of flying where they please and <lb/>
            changing their nests for others, and crossing the seas <lb/>
            without lamenting or regretting their former condition.- <lb/>
            Yes, but this happens to them because they are irrational <lb/>
            creatures.-Was reason then given to us by the gods for <note type="footnote"> 1 See Schweig.'s note. </note> <lb/>

            the purpose of unhappiness and misery, that we may pass <lb/>
            our lives in wretchedness and lamentation? Must all <lb/>
            persons be immortal and must no man go abroad, and <lb/>
            must we ourselves not go abroad, but remain rooted like <lb/>
            plants; and if any of our familiar friends goes abroad, <lb/>
            must we sit and weep; and on the contrary, when he re­ <lb/>
            turns, must we dance and clap our hands like children ?</p>
          <p>Shall we not now wean ourselves and remember what <lb/>
            we have heard from the philosophers ? if we did not listen <lb/>
            to them as if they were jugglers: they tell us that this <lb/>
            world is one city,2 and the substance out of which it has <lb/>
            been formed is one, and that there must be a certain period, <lb/>
            and that some things must give way to others, that some <lb/>
            must be dissolved, and others come in their place; some to <lb/>
            remain in the same place, and others to be moved; and <lb/>
            that all things are full of friendship, first of the gods,3 and <lb/>
            then of men who by nature are made to be of one family; <lb/>
            and some must be with one another, and others must be <lb/>
            separated, rejoicing in those who are with them, and not <lb/>
            grieving for those who are removed from them; and man <lb/>
            in addition to being by nature of a noble temper and <lb/>
            having a contempt of all things which are not in the <lb/>
            power of his will, also possesses this property not to be <lb/>
            rooted nor to be naturally fixed to the earth, but to go <lb/>
            at different times to different places, sometimes from the <lb/>
            urgency of certain occasions, and at others merely for the <lb/>
            sake of seeing. So it was with Ulysses, who saw <lb/>
            Of many men the states, and learned their ways.4 <lb/>
            And still earlier it was the fortune of Hercules to visit <lb/>
            all the inhabited world <lb/>
            Seeing men's lawless deeds and their good rules of law :3 <lb/>
            casting out and clearing away their lawlessness and intro­ <lb/>
            ducing in their place good rules of law. And yet how <lb/>
            many friends do you think that he had in Thebes, how <lb/>
            many in Argos, how many in Athens ? and how many do <note type="footnote"> 2 See ii. 5, 26. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 See iii. 13. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> 4 Homer, Odyssey i. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> a Odyssey, xvii. 487. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            you think that he gained by going about ? And he married <lb/>
            also, when it seemed to him a proper occasion, and begot <lb/>
            children, and left them without lamenting or regretting <lb/>
            or leaving them as orphans; for he knew that no man is <lb/>
            an orphan; but it is the father who takes care of all men <lb/>
            always and continuously. For it was not as mere report <lb/>
            that he had heard that Zeus is the father of men, for he <lb/>
            thought that Zeus was his own father, and he called him <lb/>
            so, and to him he looked when he was doing what he did. <lb/>
            Therefore he was enabled to live happily in all places. <lb/>
            And it is never possible for happiness and desire of what <lb/>
            is not present to come together. For that which is happy <lb/>
            must have all that it desires, must resemble a person <lb/>
            who is filled with food, and must have neither thirst nor <lb/>
            hunger.-But Ulysses felt a desire for his wife and wept <lb/>
            as he sat on a rock.-Do you attend to Homer and his <lb/>
            stories in every thing ? Or if Ulysses really wept, what <lb/>
            was he else than an unhappy man ? and what good man <lb/>
            is unhappy ? In truth the whole is badly administered, <lb/>
            if Zeus does not take care of his own citizens that they <lb/>
            may be happy like himself. But these things are not <lb/>
            lawful nor right to think of: and if Ulysses did weep <lb/>
            and lament, he was not a good man. For who is good if <lb/>
            he knows not who he is ? and who knows what he is, if he <lb/>
            forgets that things which have been made are perishable, <lb/>
            and that it is not possible for one human being to be with <lb/>
            another always ? To desire then things which are impos­ <lb/>
            sible is to have a slavish character, and is foolish: it is <lb/>
            the part of a stranger, of a man who fights against God <lb/>
            in the only way that he can, by his opinions.</p>
          <p>But my mother laments when she does not see me.— <lb/>
            Why has she not learned these principles ? and I do not <lb/>
            say this, that we should not take care that she may not <lb/>
            lament, but I say that we ought not to desire in every <lb/>
            way what is not our own. And the sorrow of another is <lb/>
            another's sorrow: but my sorrow is my own. I then will <lb/>
            stop my own sorrow by every means, for it is in my power: <lb/>
            and the sorrow of another I will endeavour to stop as far <lb/>
            as I can; but I will not attempt to do it by every means; <note type="footnote"> 6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπέχειν</foreign>. See iii. 2,13. Paul to the Philippians, iv. 18. </note> <lb/>

            for if I do, I shall be fighting against God, I shall be <lb/>
            opposing Zeus and shall be placing myself against him in <lb/>
            the administration of the universe; and the reward (the <lb/>
            punishment) of this fighting against God and of this dis­ <lb/>
            obedience not only will the children of my children pay, <lb/>
            but I also shall myself, both by day and by night, startled <lb/>
            by dreams, perturbed, trembling at every piece of news, <lb/>
            and having my tranquillity depending on the letters of <lb/>
            others.-Some person has arrived from Rome. I only hope <lb/>
            that there is no harm. But what harm can happen to <lb/>
            you, where you are not ?—From Hellas (Greece) some one <lb/>
            is come: I hope that there is no harm,-In this way every <lb/>
            place may be the cause of misfortune to you. Is it not <lb/>
            enough for you to be unfortunate there where you are, and <lb/>
            must you be so even beyond sea, and by the report of letters ? <lb/>
            Is this the way in which your affairs are in a state of <lb/>
            security ?-Well then suppose that my friends have died <lb/>
            in the places which are far from me.—What else have <lb/>
            they suffered than that which is the condition of mortals ? <lb/>
            Or how are you desirous at the same time to live to old <lb/>
            age, and at the same time not to see the death of any <lb/>
            person whom you love ? Know you not that in the course <lb/>
            of a long time many and various kinds of things must <lb/>
            happen; that a fever shall overpower one, a robber an­ <lb/>
            other, and a third a tyrant? Such is the condition of <lb/>
            things around us, such are those who live with us in the <lb/>
            world : cold and heat, and unsuitable ways of living, and <lb/>
            journeys by land, and voyages by sea, and winds, and <lb/>
            various circumstances which surround us, destroy one man, <lb/>
            and banish another, and throw one upon an embassy and <lb/>
            another into an army. Sit down then in a flutter at all <lb/>
            these things, lamenting, unhappy, unfortunate, dependent <lb/>
            on another, and dependent not on one or two, but on ten <lb/>
            thousands upon ten thousands.</p>
          <p>Did you hear this when you were with the philosophers ? <lb/>
            did you learn this? do you not know that human life is <lb/>
            a warfare ? that one man must keep watch, another must <lb/>
            go out as a spy, and a third must fight ? and it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible that all should be in one place, nor is it better that <lb/>
            it should be so. But you neglecting to do the commands <lb/>
            of the general complain when any thing more hard than <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            usual is imposed on you, and you do not observe what <lb/>
            you make the army become as far as it is in your power; <lb/>
            that if all imitate you, no man will dig a trench, no man <lb/>
            will put a rampart round, nor keep watch, nor expose <lb/>
            himself to danger, but will appear to be useless for the <lb/>
            purposes of an army. Again, in a vessel if you go as a <lb/>
            sailor, keep to one place and stick to it. And if you are <lb/>
            ordered to climb the mast, refuse; if to run to the head <lb/>
            of the ship, refuse; and what master of a ship will endure <lb/>
            you? and will he not pitch you overboard as a useless <lb/>
            thing, an impediment only and bad example to the other <lb/>
            sailors? And so it is here also: every man's life is a <lb/>
            kind of warfare, and it is long and diversified. You must <lb/>
            observe the duty of a soldier and do every thing at the <lb/>
            nod of the general; if it is possible, divining what his <lb/>
            wishes are: for there is no resemblance between that <lb/>
            general and this, neither in strength nor in superiority <lb/>
            of character. You are placed in a great office of command <lb/>
            and not in any mean place; but you are always a senator. <lb/>
            Do you not know that such a man must give little time <lb/>
            to the affairs of his household, but be often away from <lb/>
            home, either as a governor or one who is governed, or <lb/>
            discharging some office, or serving in war or acting as a <lb/>
            judge? Then do you tell me that you wish, as a plant, <lb/>
            to bo fixed to the same places and to be rooted?—Yes, <lb/>
            for it is pleasant.—Who says that it is not ? but a soup is <lb/>
            pleasant, and a handsome woman is pleasant. What else <lb/>
            do those say who make pleasure their end ? Do you not <lb/>
            see of what men you have uttered the language ? that it <lb/>
            is the language of Epicureans and catamites ? Next while <lb/>
            you are doing what they do and holding their opinions, <lb/>
            do you speak to us the words of Zeno and of Socrates, <lb/>
            Will you not throw away as far as you can the things <lb/>
            belonging to others with which you decorate yourself, <lb/>
            though they do not fit you at all ? For what else do they <lb/>
            desire than to sleep without hindrance and free from corn­ <lb/>
            pulsion, and when they have risen to yawn at their leisure, <lb/>
            and to wash the face, then write and read what they choose, <lb/>
            and then talk about some trifling matter being praised by <lb/>
            their friends whatever they may say, then to go forth for <lb/>
            a walk, and having walked about a little to bathe, and then <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            eat and sleep, such sleep as is the fashion of such men ? <lb/>
            why need we say how? for one can easily conjecture. <lb/>
            Come, do you also tell your own way of passing the time <lb/>
            which you desire, you who are an admirer of truth and <lb/>
            of Socrates and Diogenes. What do you wish to do in <lb/>
            Athens? the same (that others do), or something else? <lb/>
            Why then do you call yourself a Stoic ? Well, but they <lb/>
            who falsely call themselves Roman citizens,7 are severely <lb/>
            punished; and should those, who falsely claim so great <lb/>
            and reverend a thing and name, get off unpunished? or <lb/>
            is this not possible, but the law divine and strong and <lb/>
            inevitable is this, which exacts the severest punishments <lb/>
            from those who commit the greatest crimes ? For what <lb/>
            does this Jaw say? Let him who pretends to things which <lb/>
            do not belong to him be a boaster, a vain-glorious man :8 <lb/>
            let him who disobeys the divine administration be base, <lb/>
            and a slave; let him suffer grief, let him be envious, <lb/>
            let him pity;9 and in a word let him be unhappy and <lb/>
            lament.</p>
          <p>Well then; do you wish me to pay court to a certain <lb/>
            person ? to go to his doors?10—If reason requires this to be <lb/>
            done for the sake of country, for the sake of kinsmen, for <lb/>
            the sake of mankind, why should you not go ? You are <lb/>
            not ashamed to go to the doors of a shoemaker, when you <lb/>
            are in want of shoes, nor to the door of a gardener, when <lb/>
            you want lettuces; and are you ashamed to go to the doors <lb/>
            of the rich when you want any thing ?—Yes, for I have no <lb/>
            awe of a shoemaker—Don't feel any awe of the rich—Nor <note type="footnote"> 7 Suetonius (Claudius, 25) says: ‘Peregrinae conditionis homines, <lb/>

            will I flatter the gardener-And do not flatter the rich— <lb/>
            How then shall I get what I want ?-Do I say to you, go a- <lb/>
            if you were certain to get what you want ? And do not I <lb/>
            only tell you, that you may do what is becoming to your­ <lb/>
            self? Why then should I still go? That you may have <lb/>
            gone, that you may have discharged the duty of a citizen, <lb/>
            of a brother, of a friend. And further remember that you <lb/>
            have gone to the shoemaker, to the seller of vegetables, who <lb/>
            have no power in any thing great or noble, though he may <lb/>
            sell dear. You go to buy lettuces: they cost an obolus <lb/>
            (penny), but not a talent. So it is here also. The matter <lb/>
            is worth going for to the rich man's door-Well, I will go <lb/>
            -It is worth talking about-Let it be so; I will talk with <lb/>
            him—But you must also kiss his hand and flatter him with <lb/>
            praise-Away with that, it is a talent's worth: it is not <lb/>
            profitable to me, nor to the stale nor to my friends, to have <lb/>
            done that which spoils a good citizen and a friend.-But <lb/>
            you will seem not to have been eager about the matter, if <lb/>
            you do not succeed. Have you again forgotten why you <lb/>
            went ? Know' you not that a good man does nothing for <lb/>
            the sake of appearance, but for the sake of doing right?- <lb/>
            What advantage is it then to him to have done right ?-And <lb/>
            what advantage is it to a man who writes the name of <lb/>
            Dion to write it as he ought ?--The advantage is to have <lb/>
            written it,-Is there no reward then11 ?-Do you seek a <lb/>
            reward for a good man greater than doing what is good <lb/>
            and just ? At Olympia you wish for nothing more, but it <lb/>
            seems to you enough to be crowned at the games. Does it <lb/>
            seem to you so small and worthless a thing to be good and <note type="footnote"> 11 The reward of virtue is in the acts of virtue. The Stoics taught <lb/>
            that virtue is its own reward. When I was a boy I have written this <lb/>
            in copies, but I did not know what it meant. I know now that few <lb/>
            people believe it; and like the man here, they inquire what reward <lb/>
            they shall have for doing as they ought to do. A man of common <lb/>
            sense would give no other answer than what Epictetus gives. But <lb/>
            that will not satisfy all. The heathens must give the answer: ‘For <lb/>
            what more dost thou want when thou hast done a man a service? Art <lb/>
            thou not content that thou hast done something conformable to thy <lb/>

            happy? For these purposes being introduced by the gods <lb/>
            into this city (the world), and it being now your duty to <lb/>
            undertake the work of a man, do you still want nurses also <lb/>
            and a mamma, and do foolish women by their weeping move <lb/>
            you and make you effeminate? Will you thus never cease <lb/>
            to be a foolish child ? know you not that he who does the <lb/>
            acts of a child, the older he is, the more ridiculous <lb/>
            he is?</p>
          <p>In Athens did you see no one by going to his house ?— <lb/>
            I visited any man that I pleased-Here also be ready to <lb/>
            see, and you will see whom you please: only let it be <lb/>
            without meanness, neither with desire nor with aversion, <lb/>
            and your affairs will be well managed. But this result <lb/>
            does not depend on going nor on standing at the doors, <lb/>
            but it depends on what is within, on your opinions. <lb/>
            When you have learned not to value things which are <lb/>
            external and not dependent on the will, and to consider <lb/>
            that not one of them is your own, but that these things <lb/>
            only are your own, to exercise the judgment well, to form <lb/>
            opinions, to move towards an object, to desire, to turn <lb/>
            from a thing, where is there any longer room for flattery, <lb/>
            where for meanness ? why do you still long for the quiet <lb/>
            there (at Athens), and for the places to which you are <lb/>
            accustomed ? Wait a little and you will again find these <lb/>
            places familiar: then, if you are of so ignoble a nature, <lb/>
            again if you leave these also, weep and lament.</p>
          <p>How then shall I become of an affectionate temper ? By <lb/>
            being of a noble disposition, and happy. For it is not <lb/>
            reasonable to be mean-spirited nor to lament yourself, nor <lb/>
            to depend on another, nor over to blame God or man. I <lb/>
            entreat you, become an affectionate person in this way, by <lb/>
            observing these rules. But if through this affection, as <lb/>
            you name it, you are going to be a slave and wretched, <lb/>
            there is no profit in being affectionate. And what prevents <lb/>
            you from loving another as a person subject to mortality, <lb/>
            as one who may go away from you. Did not Socrates love <lb/>
            his own children ? He did ; but it was as a free man, as <lb/>
            one who remembered that he must first be a friend to the <lb/>
            gods. For this reason he violated nothing which was be­ <lb/>
            coming to a good man, neither in making his defence nor <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            by fixing a penalty on himself,12 nor even in the former part <lb/>
            of his life when he was a senator or when he was a soldier. <lb/>
            But we are fully supplied with every pretext for being <lb/>
            of ignoble temper, some for the sake of a child, some foff a <lb/>
            mother, and others for brethren's sake. But it is not, fit <lb/>
            for us to be unhappy on account of any person, but to be <lb/>
            happy on account of all, but chiefly on account of God who <lb/>
            has made us for this end. Well, did Diogenes13 love <lb/>
            nobody, who was so kind and so much a lover of all that <lb/>
            for mankind in general he willingly undertook so much <lb/>
            labour and bodily sufferings ? He did love mankind, but <lb/>
            how? As became a minister of God, at the same time <lb/>
            caring for men, and being also subject to God. For this <lb/>
            reason all the earth was his country, and no particular <lb/>
            place; and when he was taken prisoner he did not regret <lb/>
            Athens nor his associates and friends there, but even he <lb/>
            became familiar with the pirates and tried to improve <lb/>
            them; and being sold afterwards he lived in Corinth as <lb/>
            before at Athens; and he would have behaved the same, <lb/>
            if he had gone to the country of the Perrhaebi.14 Thus is <lb/>
            freedom acquired. For this reason he used to say, Ever <lb/>
            since Antisthenes made me free, I have not been a slave. <lb/>
            How did Antisthenes make him free ? Hear what he says : <lb/>
            Antisthenes taught me what is my own, and what is not <lb/>
            my own; possessions are not my own, nor kinsmen, <lb/>
            domestics, friends, nor reputation, nor places familiar, nor <lb/>
            mode of life; all these belong to others. What then is <lb/>
            your own? The use of appearances. This he showed to <lb/>
            me, that I possess it free from hindrance, and from com- <note type="footnote"> 12 It was the custom at Athens when the court (the dicasts) had de­ <lb/>
            termined to convict an accused person, in some cases at least, to ask <lb/>
            him what penalty he proposed to be inflicted on himself; but Socrates <lb/>
            refused to do this or to allow his friends to do it, for he said that to <lb/>
            name the penalty was the same as admitting his guilt (Xenophon, <lb/>
            Apologia, 23). Socrates said that if he did name a proper penalty for <lb/>
            himself, it would be that he should daily be allowed to dine in the <lb/>
            Prytaneium (Plato, Apology, o. 26; Cicero, Do Oratore, i. 54). </note><note type="footnote"> 13 The character of Diogenes is described very differently by Epic­ <lb/>

            pulsion, no person can put an obstacle in my way, no <lb/>
            person can force me to use appearances otherwise than I <lb/>
            wish. Who then has any power over me? Philip or <lb/>
            Alexander, or Perdiccas or the great king ? How have they <lb/>
            this power ? For if a man is going to be overpowered by <lb/>
            a man, he must long before be overpowered by things. If <lb/>
            then pleasure is not able to subdue a man, nor pain, nor <lb/>
            fame, nor wealth, but he is able, when he chooses, to spit <lb/>
            out all his poor body in a man's face and depart from life, <lb/>
            whose slave can lie still be ? But if he dwelt with pleasure <lb/>
            in Athens, and was overpowered by this manner of life, <lb/>
            his affairs would have been at every man's command; the <lb/>
            stronger would have had the power of grieving him. How <lb/>
            do you think that Diogenes would have flattered the <lb/>
            pirates that they might sell him to some Athenian, that <lb/>
            some time he might see that beautiful Piraeus, and the <lb/>
            Long Walls and the Acropolis ? In what condition would <lb/>
            you see them ? As a captive, a slave and mean: and what <lb/>
            would be the use of it for you?—Not so: but I should see <lb/>
            them as a free man—Show me, how you would be free. <lb/>
            Observe, some person has caught you, who leads you <lb/>
            away from your accustomed place of abode and says, You <lb/>
            are my slave, for it is in my power to hinder you from <lb/>
            living as you please, it is in my power to treat you gently, <lb/>
            and to humble you: when I choose, on the contrary you <lb/>
            are cheerful and go elated to Athens. What do you say to <lb/>
            him who treats you as a slave ? What means have you of <lb/>
            finding one who will rescue you from slavery ?15 Or cannot <lb/>
            you even look him in the face, but without saying more do <lb/>
            you intreat to be set free ? Man, you ought to go gladly to <lb/>
            prison, hastening, going before those who lead you there. <lb/>
            Then, I ask you, are you unwilling to live in Rome and <lb/>
            desire to live in Hellas (Greece) ? And when you must <lb/>
            die, will you then also fill us with your lamentations, <lb/>
            because you will not see Athens nor walk about in the <lb/>
            Lyceion ? Have you gone abroad for this ? was it for this <lb/>

            even all that you have learned that you may not bring a <lb/>
            bad name on your theorems as useless ? What harm has <lb/>
            philosophy done you? Wherein has Chrysippus injured <lb/>
            you that you should prove by your acts that his labours <lb/>
            are useless ? Were the evils that you had there (at home) <lb/>
            not enough, those which were the cause of your pain and <lb/>
            lamentation, even if you had not gone abroad ? Have you <lb/>
            added more to the list ? And if you again have other <lb/>
            acquaintances and friends, you will have more causes for <lb/>
            lamentation; and the same also if you take an affection <lb/>
            for another country. Why then do you live to surround <lb/>
            yourself with other sorrows upon sorrows through which <lb/>
            you are unhappy? Then, I ask you, do you call this <lb/>
            affection ? What affection, man! If it is a good thing, it <lb/>
            is the cause of no evil: if it is bad, I have nothing to do <lb/>
            with it. I am formed by nature for my own good: I am <lb/>
            not formed for my own evil.</p>
          <p>What then is the discipline for this purpose ? First of <lb/>
            all the highest and the principal, and that which stands as <lb/>
            it were at the entrance, is this; when you are delighted <lb/>

            one of those which cannot be taken away, but as with <lb/>
            something of such a kind, as an earthen pot is, or a glass <lb/>
            cup, that when it has been broken, you may remember <lb/>
            what it was, and may not be troubled. So in this matter <lb/>
            also: if you kiss your own child, or your brother or friend, <lb/>
            never give full license to the appearance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασίαν</foreign>), and <lb/>
            allow not your pleasure to go as far as it chooses; but <lb/>
            check it, and curb it as those who stand behind men in <lb/>
            their triumphs and remind them that they are mortal.18 <lb/>
            Do you also remind yourself in like manner, that he whom <lb/>
            you love is mortal, and that what you love is nothing of <lb/>
            your own: it has been given to you for the present, not <lb/>
            that it should not be taken from you, nor has it been given <lb/>
            to you for all time, but as a fig is given to you or a bunch <lb/>
            of grapes at the appointed season of the year. But if you <lb/>
            wish for these things in winter, you are a fool. So if you <lb/>
            wish for your son or friend when it is not allowed to <lb/>
            you, you must know that you are wishing for a fig in <lb/>
            winter.19 For such as winter is to a fig, such is every <lb/>
            event which happens from the universe to the things <lb/>
            which are taken away according to its nature. And <lb/>
            further, at the times when you arc delighted with a thing, <lb/>
            place before yourself the contrary appearances. What <lb/>
            harm is it while you are kissing your child to say with a <lb/>
            lisping voice, To-morrow you will die; and to a friend <lb/>
            also, To-morrow you will go away or I shall, and never <lb/>
            shall we see one another again ?-But these are words of <lb/>
            bad omen-And some incantations also are of bad omen; <lb/>
            but because they are useful, I don't care for this; only let <lb/>
            them be useful. But do you call things to be of bad omen <lb/>
            except those which are significant of some evil ? Cowardice <lb/>
            is a word of bad omen, and meanness of spirit, and sorrow, <lb/>
            and grief and shamelessness. These words are of bad <lb/>

            order to protect ourselves against the things. Do you tell <lb/>
            me that a name which is significant of any natural thing <lb/>
            is of evil omen ? say that even for the ears of corn to be, <note type="footnote"> 18 It was the custom in Roman triumphs for a slave to stand behind <lb/>

            the common sense of the world, the earth and all that is on it. Epictetus <lb/>
            appears to teach that when a man dies, his existence is terminated. <lb/>
            The body is resolved into the elements of which it is formed, and these <lb/>
            elements are employed for other purposes. Consistently with this <lb/>
            doctrine he may have supposed that the powers, which we call rational <lb/>
            and intellectual, exist in man by virtue only of the organisation of his <lb/>
            brain which is superior to that of all other animals; and that what <lb/>
            we name the soul has no existence independent of the body. It was <lb/>
            an old Greek hypothesis that at death the body returned to earth from <lb/>
            which it came, and the soul (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πνεῦμα</foreign>) returned to the regions above, <lb/>
            from which it came. I cannot discover any passage in Epictetus in <lb/>

            by Domitian, when he retired to Nicopolis an old man, and taught <lb/>
            there. Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians (c. 15) contains his <lb/>
            doctrine of the resurrection, which is accepted, I believe, by all, or <lb/>
            nearly all, if there are any exceptions, who profess the Christian faith: <lb/>
            but it is not understood by all in the same way. </note><note type="footnote"> Paul teaches that Christ died for our sins, that he was buried and <lb/>
            rose again on the third day; and that after his resurrection he was <lb/>
            seen by many persons. Then he asks, if Christ rose from the dead, how <lb/>
            can some say that there is no resurrection of the dead ? ' But if there <lb/>
            be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen' (v. 13); and <lb/>
            (v. 19),' if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men <lb/>
            most miserable.' But he affirms again (v. 20) that Christ is risen and <lb/>
            become the first fruits of them that slept.' In v. 32, he asks what <lb/>
            advantages he has from his struggles in Ephesus, ‛if the dead rise <lb/>
            not: let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.' He seems not to <lb/>
            admit the value of life, if there is no resurrection of the dead; and he <lb/>
            seems to say that we shall seek or ought to seek only the pleasures of <lb/>
            sense, because life is short, if we do not believe in a resurrection of <lb/>
            the dead. It may be added that there is not any direct assertion in <lb/>
            this chapter that Christ ascended to heaven in a bodily form, or that <lb/>
            lie ascended to heaven in any way. He then says (v. 35),' But some <lb/>
            man will say, How are the dead raised up ? and with what body do <lb/>
            they come ?' He answers this question (v. 36),' Thou fool, that which <lb/>
            thou sowest is not quickened except it die': and he adds that' God <lb/>
            giveth it (the seed) a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed <lb/>
            his own body.' We all know that the body, which is produced from <lb/>
            the seed, is not the body ‛ that shall be and we also know that the <lb/>
            seed which is sown does not die, and that if the seed died, no body <lb/>
            would be produced from such seed. His conclusion is that the dead <lb/>
            'is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body' (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σῶμα πνευ­ <lb/>
            ματικόν</foreign>). I believe that the commentators do not agree about this <lb/>
            ‛ spiritual body': but it seems plain that Paul did not teach that the <lb/>
            body which will rise will be the same as the body which is buried. He <lb/>
            says (v. 50) that' flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.' <lb/>
            Yet in the Apostles’ Creed we pronounce our belief in the ‛resurrec­ <lb/>
            tion of the body': but in the Nicene Creed it is said we look'for <lb/>
            the resurrection of the dead,' which is a different thing or may have a </note> <lb/>

            attentive only to this, how he may fill his place with due <lb/>
            regularity, and obediently to God. Dost thou still wish <lb/>
            me to exist (live)? I will continue to exist as free, as <lb/>
            noble in nature, as thou hast wished me to exist: for <lb/>
            thou hast made me free from hindrance in that which is <lb/>
            my own. But hast thou no further need of me ? I thank <lb/>
            thee; and so far I have remained for thy sake, and for the <lb/>
            sake of no other person, and now in obedience to thee I <lb/>
            depart. How dost thou depart? Again, I say, as thou <lb/>
            hast pleased, as free, as thy servant, as one who has known <lb/>
            thy commands and thy prohibitions. And so long as I <lb/>
            shall stay in thy service, whom dost thou will me to be? <lb/>
            A prince or a private man, a senator or a common person, <lb/>
            a soldier or a general, a teacher or a master of a family ? <lb/>
            whatever place and position thou mayest assign to me, as <lb/>
            Socrates says, I will die ten thousand times rather than <lb/>
            desert them. And where dost thou will me to be? in <lb/>
            Rome or Athens, or Thebes or Gyara. Only remember me <lb/>
            there where I am. If thou sendest me to a place where <lb/>
            there are no means for men living according to nature, I <lb/>
            shall not depart (from life) in disobedience to thee, but as <lb/>
            if thou wast giving me the signal to retreat: I do not <lb/>
            leave thee, let this be far from my intention, but I per­ <lb/>
            ceive that thou hast no need of me. If means of living <lb/>
            according to nature be allowed to me, I will seek no other <lb/>

            said be contrary to your wish, this reflection first will im­ <lb/>
            mediately relieve you, that it is not unexpected. For it is <lb/>
            a great thing in all cases to say, I knew that I begot a <lb/>
            son who is mortal.23 For so you also will say, I knew that. <lb/>
            I am mortal, I knew that I may leave my home, I knew <lb/>
            that I may be ejected from it, I knew that I may be led to <lb/>
            prison. Then if you turn round and look to yourself, and <lb/>
            seek the place from which comes that which has happened, <lb/>
            you will forthwith recollect that it comes from the place <lb/>
            of things which are out of the power of the will, and of <lb/>
            things which are not my own. What then is it to me? <lb/>
            Then, you will ask, and this is the chief thing: And who <lb/>
            is it that sent it ? The leader, or the general, the state, <lb/>
            the law of the state. Give it me then, for I must always <lb/>
            obey the law in every thing. Then, when the appearance <lb/>
            (of things) pains you, for it is not in your power to <lb/>
            prevent this, contend against it by the aid of reason, <lb/>
            conquer it: do not allow it to gain strength nor to lead <lb/>
            you to the consequences by raising images such as it <lb/>
            pleases and as it pleases. If you be in Gyara, do not <lb/>
            imagine the mode of living at Rome, and how many plea­ <lb/>
            sures there were for him who lived there and how many <lb/>
            there would be for him who returned to Rome: but fix <lb/>
            your mind on this matter, how a man who lives in Gyara <lb/>
            ought to live in Gyara like a man of courage. And if you <lb/>
            be in Rome, do not imagine what the life in Athens is, but. <lb/>
            think only of the life in Rome.</p>
          <p>Then in the place of all other delights substitute this, <lb/>
            that of being conscious that you are obeying God, that not <lb/>
            in word, but in deed you are performing the acts of a wise <lb/>
            and good man. For what a thing it is for a man to be <lb/>
            able to say to himself, Now whatever the rest may say in <lb/>
            solemn manner in the schools and may be judged to be <lb/>
            saying in a way contrary to common opinion (or in a <lb/>
            strange way), this I am doing; and they are sitting and <lb/>
            are discoursing of my virtues and inquiring about me and <lb/>
            praising me ; and of this Zeus has willed that I shall receive <lb/>
            from myself a demonstration, and shall myself know if he <lb/>
            has a soldier such as he ought to have, a citizen such as <note type="footnote"> <unclear>23</unclear> Seneca de Consol. ad Pol. c. SO; Cicero, Tuscul. Disp. iii. 13. </note> <lb/>

            servants ? nor yet because he cares not for me, for he d <lb/>
            not neglect any even of the smallest things; 24 but <lb/>
            does this for the purpose of exercising me and making <lb/>
            of me as a witness to others. Being appointed to <unclear>suc</unclear> a <lb/>
            service, do I still care about the place in which I am, or <lb/>
            with whom I am, or what men say about me ? and do I <lb/>
            not entirely direct my thoughts to God and to his instruc­ <lb/>
            tions and commands?</p>
          <p>Having these things (or thoughts) always in hand, and <lb/>
            exercising them by yourself, and keeping them in readiness, <lb/>
            you will never be in want of one to comfort you and <lb/>

            something to eat, but not to have reason sufficient for <lb/>
            keeping away fear and sorrow. But if once you have <lb/>
            gained exemption from sorrow and fear, will there any <lb/>
            longer be a tyrant for you, or a tyrant's guard, or atten­ <lb/>

          <p>CONSIDER as to the things which you proposed to yourself at <lb/>
            first, which you have secured, and which you have not; and <lb/>
            how you are pleased when you recall to memory the one, <lb/>
            and are pained about the other; and if it is possible, recover <lb/>
            the things wherein you failed. For we must not shrink <lb/>
            when we are engaged in the greatest combat, but we must <lb/>
            even take blows.1 For the combat before us is not in wrest­ <lb/>
            ling and the Pancration, in which both the successful and <lb/>
            the unsuccessful may have the greatest merit, or may have <lb/>
            little, and in truth may be very fortunate or very unfor­ <lb/>
            tunate ; but the combat is for good fortune and happiness <lb/>
            themselves. Well then, oven if we have renounced the <lb/>
            contest in this matter (for good fortune and happiness), no <lb/>
            man hinders us from renewing the cumbat again, and we <lb/>
            are not compelled to wait for another four years that the <lb/>
            games at Olympia may come again 2; but as soon as you <lb/>
            have recovered and restored yourself, and employ the <lb/>
            same zeal, you may renew the combat again; and if again <lb/>
            you renounce it, you may again renew it; and if you once <lb/>
            gain the victory, you are like him who has never renounced <lb/>
            the combat. Only do not through a habit of doing the <lb/>
            same thing (renouncing the combat) begin to do it with <lb/>
            pleasure, and then like a bad athlete go about after being <lb/>

            have I not been overpowered before ? An inclination arises <lb/>

            bathed before? If then the physician can say to him, Well, <lb/>
            and what then happened to you after the bath ? Had you <lb/>
            not a fever, had you not a headache ? And when you found <lb/>
            fault with a person lately, did you not do the act of a <lb/>
            malignant person, of a trifling babbler ; did you not cherish <lb/>
            this habit in you by adding to it the corresponding acts? <lb/>

            did, as slaves remember the blows which they have received, <lb/>
            to abstain from the same faults. But the one case is not <lb/>
            like the other; for in the case of slaves the pain causes the <lb/>
            remembrance : but in the case of your faults, what is the <lb/>

            that sufferings of a painful character would be useful to him, as they <lb/>

            and children, who will suffer the same dreadful end. The consolation, <lb/>

            The fact is true. Death is the lot of all. But a painful death by <lb/>
            hunger cannot be alleviated by a man knowing that all must die in <lb/>

            descend hungry, if it should so happen, but they burst by <lb/>
            indigestion and drunkenness. What beggar did you hardly <lb/>
            ever see who was not an old man, and even of extreme old <lb/>
            age ? But chilled with cold day and night, and lying on <lb/>
            the ground, and eating only what is absolutely necessary <lb/>
            they approach near to the impossibility of dying.4 Cannot <lb/>
            you write? Cannot you teach (take care of) children? <lb/>
            Cannot you be a watchman at another person's door?—But <lb/>
            it is shameful to come to such a necessity.-Learn then <lb/>
            first what are the things which are shameful, and then tell <lb/>
            us that you are a philosopher : but at present do not, even <lb/>
            if any other man call you so, allow it.</p>
          <p>Is that shameful to you which is not your own act, that <lb/>
            of which you are not the cause, that which has come to you <lb/>
            by accident, as a headache, as a fever? If your parents <lb/>
            were poor, and left their property to others, and if while <lb/>
            they live, they do not help you at all, is this shameful to <lb/>
            you? Is this what you learned with the philosophers? Did <lb/>
            you never hear that the thing which is shameful ought to <lb/>
            be blamed, and that which is blameable is worthy of blame ? <lb/>
            Whom do you blame for an act which is not his own, which <lb/>
            he did not do himself? Did you then make your father such <lb/>
            as he is, or is it in your power to improve him ? Is this <lb/>
            power given to you? Well then, ought you to wish the <lb/>
            things which are not given to you, or to be ashamed if you <lb/>
            do not obtain them ? And have you also been accustomed <lb/>
            while you were studying philosophy to look to others and <lb/>
            to hope for nothing from yourself? Lament then and groan <lb/>
            and eat with fear that you may not have food to-morrow. <note type="footnote"> 1 We see many old beggars who endure what others could not <lb/>

            that which is not subject to hindrance, in that which cannot <lb/>

            Nicopolis are used to exclaim, By the fortune of Caesar,4 <lb/>
            we are free.</p>
          <p>However, if you please, let us not speak of Caesar at <lb/>
            present. But tell me this: did you never love any person, <lb/>
            a young girl, or slave, or free ? What then is this with <lb/>
            respect to being a slave or free? Were you never com­ <lb/>
            manded by the person beloved to do something which you <lb/>
            did not wish to do ? have you never flattered your little <lb/>
            slave? have you never kissed her feet? And yet if any <lb/>
            man compelled you to kiss Caesar's feet, you would think <lb/>
            it an insult and excessive tyranny. What else then is <lb/>
            slavery? Did you never go oat by night to some place <lb/>
            whither you did not wish to go, did you not expend what <lb/>
            you did not wish to expend, did you not utter words with <lb/>
            sighs and groans, did you not submit to abuse and to bo <note type="footnote"> * A usual form of oath. See ii. 20. 29. Upton compares the Roman <lb/>

            excluded ?5 But if you are ashamed to confess your own <lb/>
            acts, see what Thrasonides6 says and does, who having <lb/>
            seen so much military service as perhaps not even you <lb/>
            have, first of all went out by night, when Geta (a slave) <lb/>
            does not venture out, but if he were compelled by his <lb/>
            master, would have cried out much and would have gone <lb/>
            out lamenting his bitter slavery. Next, what does Thra­ <lb/>
            sonides say ? A worthless girl has enslaved me, me whom <lb/>
            no enemy ever did. Unhappy man, who are the slave even <lb/>
            of a girl, and a worthless girl. Why then do you still call <lb/>
            yourself free? and why do you talk of your service in the <lb/>
            army ? Then he calls for a sword and is angry with him <lb/>
            who out of kindness refuses it; and he sends presents to <lb/>
            her who hates him, and intreats and weeps, and on the <lb/>
            other hand having had a little success he is elated. But <lb/>

          <p>Now consider in the case of animals, how we employ <lb/>
            the notion of liberty. Men keep tame lions shut up, and <lb/>

            that this lion is free ?7 Is it not the fact that the more <lb/>
            he lives at his ease, so much the more he is in a slavish <lb/>
            condition ? and who if he had perception and reason would <lb/>
            wish to be one of these lions? Well, these birds when <lb/>
            they are caught and are kept shut up, how much do they <lb/>
            suffer in their attempts to escape?8 and some of them die <lb/>
            of hunger rather than submit to such a kind of life. And <lb/>

            escape. So much do they desire their natural liberty, and <lb/>
            to be independent and free from hindrance. And what <lb/>
            harm is there to you in this? What do you say? I am <lb/>

            cannot endure capture, but as soon as they are caught, <lb/>
            escape from captivity by death. So Diogenes also some­ <lb/>
            where says that there is only one way to freedom, and <lb/>
            that is to die content: and he writes to the Persian king, <lb/>
            You cannot enslave the Athenian state any more than you <lb/>
            can enslave fishes. How is that? cannot I catch them? <lb/>
            If you catch them, says Diogenes, they will immediately <lb/>
            leave you, as fishes do; for if you catch a fish, it dies; and <lb/>
            if these men that are caught shall die, of what use to you <lb/>
            is the preparation for war? These are the words of a <lb/>
            free man who had carefully examined the thing, and, as <lb/>
            was natural, bad discovered it. But if you look for it in <lb/>

          <p>The slave wishes to be set free immediately. Why ? <lb/>
            Do you think that he wishes to pay money to the collec­ <lb/>
            tors of twentieths?9 No; but because he imagines that <lb/>
            hitherto through not having obtained this, he is hindered <lb/>
            and unfortunate. If 1 shall be set free, immediately it is <lb/>

            and like to them, I go where J choose, I come from any <lb/>
            place I choose, and go where I choose. Then he is set <lb/>
            free; and forthwith having no place where he can eat, he <lb/>
            looks for some man to flatter, some one with whom he <lb/>
            shall sup: then he either works with his body and en­ <lb/>

            slavery; or even if he is become rich, being a man with­ <lb/>
            out any knowledge of what is good, he loves some little <lb/>
            girl, and in his unhappiness laments and desires to be a <lb/>
            slave again. He says, what evil did I suffer in my state <lb/>
            of slavery? Another clothed me, another supplied me <lb/>
            with shoes, another fed me, another looked after me in <lb/>
            sickness; and I did only a few services for him. But <lb/>
            now a wretched man, what things I suffer, being a slave <lb/>
            to many instead of to one. But however, he says, if I <lb/>
            shall acquire rings,11 then I shall live most prosperously <lb/>
            and happily. First, in order to acquire these rings, he <lb/>
            submits to that which he is worthy of; then when he has <lb/>
            acquired them, it is again all the same. Then he says, <lb/>
            If I shall be engaged in military service, I am free from <lb/>
            all evils. He obtains military service. He suffers as much <lb/>
            as a flogged slave, and nevertheless he asks for a second <lb/>
            service and a third. After this, when he has put the finish­ <lb/>
            ing stroke (the colophon) 12 to his career, and is become a <lb/>
            senator, then he becomes a slave by entering into the <lb/>
            assembly, then he serves the finer and most splendid <lb/>
            slavery-not to be a fool, but to learn what Socrates <lb/>
            taught, what is the nature of each thing that exists, and that <lb/>
            a man should not rashly adapt preconceptions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προλήψεις</foreign>) <lb/>
            to the several things which are.13 For this is the cause <lb/>
            to men of all their evils, the not being able to adapt the <lb/>
            general preconceptions to the several things. But we <lb/>
            have different opinions (about the cause of our evils). <lb/>
            One man thinks that he is sick: not so however, but the <lb/>
            fact is that he does not adapt his preconceptions right. <lb/>
            Another thinks that he is poor; another that he has a <lb/>
            severe father or mother; and another again that Caesar is <lb/>
            not favourable to him. But all this is one and only one <lb/>
            thing, the not knowing how to adapt the preconceptions. <lb/>
            For who has not a preconception of that which is bad, <note type="footnote"> 11 A gold ring was worn by the Equites; and accordingly to desire the <lb/>

            that it is hurtful, that it ought to be avoided, that it ought <lb/>
            in every way to be guarded against ? One preconception <lb/>
            is not repugnant to another,14 only where it comes to the <lb/>
            matter of adaptation. What then is this evil, which is <lb/>
            both hurtful, and a thing to be avoided? He answers <lb/>
            not to be Caesar's friend.-He is gone far from the mark, <lb/>
            he has missed the adaptation, he is embarrassed, he <lb/>
            seeks the things which are not at all pertinent to the <lb/>
            matter; for when he has succeeded in being Caesar's <lb/>
            friend, never the less he has failed in finding what he <lb/>
            sought. For what is that which every man seeks ? To <lb/>
            live secure, to be happy, to do every thing as he wishes, <lb/>
            not to be hindered, nor compelled. When then he is <lb/>
            become the friend of Caesar, is he free from hindrance ? <lb/>
            free from compulsion, is he tranquil, is he happy? Of <lb/>
            whom shall we inquire ? What more trustworthy witness <lb/>
            have we than this very man who is become Caesar's <lb/>
            friend ? Come forward and tell us when did you sleep <lb/>
            more quietly, now or before you became Caesar's friend ? <lb/>
            Immediately you hear the answer, Stop, I intreat you, and <lb/>
            do not mock me: you know not what miseries I suffer, <lb/>
            and sleep does not come to me; but one comes and says, <lb/>
            Caesar is already awake, he is now going forth: then <lb/>
            come troubles and cares-Well, when did you sup with <lb/>
            more pleasure, now or before? Hear what he says about <lb/>
            this also. He says that if he is not invited, he is pained: <lb/>
            and if he is invited, he sups like a slave with his master, <lb/>
            all the while being anxious that he does not say or do any <lb/>
            thing foolish. And what do you suppose that he is afraid <lb/>
            of; lest he should be lashed like a slave ? How can he <lb/>
            expect any thing so good ? No, but as befits so great a <lb/>
            man, Caesar's friend, he is afraid that he may lose his <lb/>
            head. And when did you bathe more free from trouble, <lb/>
            and take your gymnastic exercise more quietly ? In fine, <lb/>
            which kind of life did you prefer? your present or your <lb/>
            former life? I can swear that no man is so stupid or so <lb/>
            ignorant of truth as not to bewail his own misfortunes the <lb/>
            nearer he is is friendship to Caesar. <note type="footnote"> a. Compare i. 22. </note> <pb n="301"/>
            </p>
          <p>Since then neither those who are called kings live as <lb/>
            they choose, nor the friends of kings, who finally are <lb/>
            those who arc free? Seek, and you will find; for you <lb/>
            have aids from nature for the discovery of truth. But if <lb/>
            you are not able yourself by going along these ways only <lb/>
            to discover that which follows, listen to those who have <lb/>
            made the inquiry. What do they say? Does freedom <lb/>
            seem to you a good thing? The greatest good. Is it <lb/>
            possible then that he who obtains the greatest good can be <lb/>
            unhappy or fare badly? No. Whomsoever then you <lb/>
            shall see unhappy, unfortunate, lamenting, confidently <lb/>
            declare that they are not free. I do declare it. We have <lb/>
            now then got away from buying and selling and from such <lb/>
            arrangements about matters of property: for if you have <lb/>
            rightly assented to these matters, if the great king (the <lb/>
            Persian king) is unhappy, he cannot be free, nor can a <lb/>
            little king, nor a man of consular rank, nor one who has <lb/>
            been twice consul.-Be it so.</p>
          <p>Further then answer me this question also, does freedom <lb/>
            seem to you to be something great and noble and valu­ <lb/>
            able ?-How should it not seem so? Is it possible then <lb/>
            when a man obtains anything so great and valuable and <lb/>
            noble to be mean ?-It is not possible-When then you see <lb/>
            any man subject to another or flattering him contrary to <lb/>
            his own opinion, confidently affirm that this man also is <lb/>
            not free; and not only if he do this for a bit of supper, <lb/>
            but also if he does it for a government (province) or a <lb/>
            consulship: and call these men little slaves who for the <lb/>
            sake of little matters do these things, and those who do so <lb/>
            for the sake of great things call great slaves, as they <lb/>
            deserve to be.—This is admitted also-Do you think that <lb/>
            freedom is a thing independent and self governing?- <lb/>
            Certainly—Whomsoever then it is in the power of another <lb/>
            to hinder and compel, declare that he is not free. And do <lb/>
            not look, I intreat you, after his grandfathers and great <lb/>
            grandfathers, or inquire about his being bought or sold; <lb/>
            but if you hear him saying from his heart and with <lb/>
            feeling, ' Master,' even if the twelve fasces precede him (as <lb/>
            consul), call him a slave. And if you hear him say, <lb/>
            ' Wretch that I am, how much I suffer,' call him a slave. <lb/>
            If finally you see him lamenting, complaining, unhappy, <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            call him a slave though he wears a praetexta.15 If then he <lb/>
            is doing nothing of this kind, do not yet say that he is <lb/>
            free, but learn his opinions, whether they are subject to <lb/>
            compulsion, or may produce hindrance, or to bad fortune; <lb/>
            and if you find him such, call him a slave who has a holi­ <lb/>
            day in the Saturnalia : 16 say that his master is from <lb/>
            home: he will return soon, and you will know what he <lb/>
            suffers. Who will return ? Whoever has in himself the <lb/>
            power over anything which is desired by the man, either <lb/>
            to give it to him or to take it away ? Thus then have we <lb/>
            many masters? We have: for we have circumstances as <lb/>
            masters prior to our present masters; and these circum­ <lb/>
            stances are many. Therefore it must of necessity be that <lb/>
            those who have the power over any of these circumstances <lb/>
            must be our masters. For no man fears Caesar himself, <lb/>
            but he fears death, banishment, deprivation of his pro­ <lb/>
            perty, prison, and disgrace. Nor does any man love <lb/>
            Caesar, unless Caesar is a person of great merit, but he <lb/>
            loves wealth, the office of tribune, praetor or consul. When <lb/>
            we love, and hate and fear these things, it must be that <lb/>
            those who have the power over them must be our masters. <lb/>
            Therefore we adore them even as gods; for we think that <lb/>
            what possesses the power of conferring the greatest <lb/>
            advantage on us is divine. Then we wrongly assume <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν̒ποτάσμεν</foreign>) that a certain person has the power of con­ <lb/>
            ferring the greatest advantages; therefore he is something <lb/>
            divine. For if we wrongly assume 17 that a certain person <lb/>
            has the power of conferring the greatest advantages, it is <lb/>
            a necessary consequence that the conclusion from these <lb/>
            premises must be false.</p>
          <p>What then is that which makes a man free from <lb/>
            hindrance and makes him his own master ? For wealth <lb/>
            does not do it, nor consulship, nor provincial government, <note type="footnote"> is Sic practextatos referunt Artaxata mores.—Juv. ii. 170. <lb/>

            nor royal power; but something else must be discovered. <lb/>
            What then is that which when we write makes us free from <lb/>
            hindrance and unimpeded ? The knowledge of the art of <lb/>
            writing. What then is it in playing the lute? The <lb/>

            depend on others can be free from hindrance? No-Is it <lb/>
            possible for him to be unimpeded ? No-Therefore he <lb/>
            cannot be free. Consider then: whether we have nothing <lb/>
            which is in our own power only, or whether we have all <lb/>

            to admit, to allow, or, to use another word, to believe in that which seems <lb/>
            to him to be false, or, to use the same word again, to believe in that in <lb/>
            which he does not believe. When the Christian uses the two creeds, <lb/>
            which begin with the words, 'I believe etc.,' he knows or he ought to <lb/>
            know, that he cannot compel an unbeliever to accept the same belief. <lb/>
            He may by pains and penalties of various kinds compel some persons <lb/>
            to profess or to express the same belief: but as no pains or penalties <lb/>
            could compel some Christians to deny their belief, so I suppose that <lb/>
            perhaps there are men who could not be compelled to express this <lb/>
            belief when they have it not. The case of the believer and the un­ <lb/>
            believer however are not the same. The believer may be strengthened <lb/>
            in his belief by the belief that he will in some way be punished by God, <lb/>
            if he denies that which he believes. The unbeliever will not have the <lb/>
            same motive or reason for not expressing his assent to that which he <lb/>
            does not believe. He believes that it is and will be all the same to <lb/>
            him with respect to God, whether he gives his assent to that which he <lb/>
            does not believe or refuses his assent. There remains nothing then to <lb/>
            trouble him if he expresses his assent to that which he does not believe, <lb/>
            except the opinion of those who know that he does not believe, or his <lb/>
            own reflections on expressing his assent to that which he does not <lb/>
            believe; or in other words his publication of a lie, which may probably <lb/>
            do no harm to any man or in any way. I believe that some men are <lb/>
            strong enough, under some circumstances at least, to refuse their assent <lb/>
            to any thing which they do not believe; but I do not affirm that they <lb/>
            would do this under all circumstances. </note><note type="footnote"> To return to the matter under consideration, a man cannot be com­ <lb/>

          <p>When you have made this preparation, and have prac­ <lb/>
            tised this discipline, to distinguish that which belongs to <lb/>
            another from that which is your own, the things which <lb/>
            are subject to hindrance from those which are not, to con­ <lb/>
            sider the things free from hindrance to concern yourself, <lb/>
            and those which are not free not to concern yourself, to <lb/>
            keep your desire steadily fixed to the things which do <lb/>
            concern yourself, and turned from the things which do <lb/>
            not concern yourself; do you still fear any man ? No one. <lb/>
            For about what will you be afraid ? about the things which <lb/>
            are your own, in which consists the nature of good and <lb/>
            evil ? and who has power over these things ? who can take <lb/>
            them away ? who can impede them ? No man can, no more <lb/>
            than he can impede God. But will you be afraid about <lb/>
            your body and your possessions, about things which are <lb/>
            not yours, about things which in no way concern you ? <lb/>
            and what else have you been studying from the beginning <lb/>
            than to distinguish between your own and not your own, <lb/>
            the things which are in your power and not in your power, <lb/>
            the things subject to hindrance and not subject ? and why <lb/>
            have you come to the philosophers? was it that you may <lb/>
            never the less be unfortunate and unhappy ? You will then <lb/>
            in this way, as I have supposed you to have done, be with­ <lb/>
            out fear and disturbance. And what is grief to you ? for <lb/>
            fear comes from what you expect, but grief from that which <lb/>
            is present.24 But what further will you desire? For of <lb/>
            the things which are within the power of the will, as being <lb/>
            good and present, you have a proper and regulated dcsira : <note type="footnote"> 23 Here be speaks of asses being shod. The Latin translation of the <lb/>
            word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν̔ποδημἀτια</foreign>) in Epictetus is 'ferreas calces. I suppose they <lb/>

            but of the things which are not in the power of the will <lb/>
            you do not desire any one, and so you do not allow any <lb/>
            place to that which is irrational, and impatient, and above <lb/>
            measure hasty.25</p>
          <p>When then you are thus affected towards things, what <lb/>
            man can any longer be formidable to you? For what has <lb/>
            a man which is formidable to another, either when you see <lb/>
            him or speak to him or finally are conversant with him ? <lb/>
            Not more than one horse has with respect to another, or <lb/>
            one clog to another, or one bee to another bee. Things <lb/>
            indeed are formidable to every man; and when any man <lb/>
            is able to confer these things on another or to take them <lb/>
            away, then he too becomes formidable. How then is an <lb/>
            acropolis (a stronghold or fortress, the seat of tyranny) <lb/>
            demolished ? Not by the sword, not by fire, but by opinion. <lb/>
            For if we abolish the acropolis which is in the city, can we <lb/>
            abolish also that of fever, and that of beautiful women ? <lb/>
            Can we in a word abolish the acropolis which is in us and <lb/>
            cast out the tyrants within us,26 whom we have daily over <lb/>
            us, sometimes the same tyrants, at other times different <lb/>
            tyrants? But with this we must begin, and with this we <lb/>
            must demolish the acropolis and eject the tyrants, by giving <lb/>
            up the body, the parts of it, the faculties of it, the posses­ <lb/>
            sions, the reputation, magisterial offices, honours, children, <lb/>
            brothers, friends, by considering all these things as belong­ <lb/>
            ing to others. And if tyrants have been ejected from us, <lb/>
            why do I still shut in the acropolis by a wall of circum­ <lb/>
            vallation,27 at least on my account; for if it still stands, what <lb/>
            does it do to me ? why do 1 still eject (the tyrant's) guards ? <lb/>
            For where do I perceive them ? against others they have <lb/>
            their fasces, and their spears and their swords. But I <lb/>
            have never been hindered in my will, nor compelled when <lb/>
            I did not will. And how is this possible ? I have placed <note type="footnote"> 25 See Schweig.'s note. </note><note type="footnote"> 26 Schweig. suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταβεβλήκαμεν</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀΠοβεβλήκαμεν</foreign>, though <lb/>

            ship on the road either of an ambassador, or of a quaestor, <lb/>
            or of a proconsul, and when he has attached himself to such <lb/>
            persons he goes along the road safely. So in the world30 <lb/>
            the wise man acts. There are many companies of robbers, <lb/>
            tyrants, storms, difficulties, losses of that which is dearest. <lb/>
            Where is there any place of refuge ? how shall he pass <lb/>
            along without being attacked by rubbers ? what company <lb/>
            shall lie wait for that he may pass along in safety ? to whom <lb/>
            shall he attach himself? To what person generally? to <lb/>
            the rich man, to the man of consular rank? and what is <lb/>
            the use of that to me? Such a man is stripped himself, <lb/>
            groans and laments. But what if the fellow companion <lb/>
            himself turns against me and becomes my robber, what <lb/>
            shall I do ? I will be a friend of Caesar: when I am Caesar's <lb/>
            companion no man will wrong me. In the first place, that <lb/>

            are daily exercising yourself as you do there (in the school), <lb/>
            not that you are philosophizing, for this is an arrogant <lb/>
            (offensive) expression, but that you are presenting an <lb/>
            asserter of freedom :37 for this is really freedom. To this <lb/>
            freedom Diogenes was called by Antisthenes, and he said <lb/>
            that he could no longer be enslaved by any man. For <lb/>
            this reason when he was taken prisoner,38 how did he <lb/>
            behave to the pirates ? Did he call any of them master ? <lb/>
            and I do not speak of the name, for I am not afraid of the <lb/>
            word, but of the state of mind, by which the word is pro­ <lb/>
            duced. How did he reprove them for feeding badly their <lb/>
            captives ? How was he sold ? Did he seek a master? no; <lb/>
            but a slave. And when he was sold how did he behave to <lb/>
            his master?39 Immediately he disputed with him and <lb/>
            said to his master that he ought not to be dressed as he <lb/>
            was, nor shaved in such a manner; and about the children <lb/>
            he told them how he ought to bring them up. And what <lb/>
            was strange in this ? for if his master had bought an <lb/>
            exercise master, would he have employed him in the exer­ <lb/>
            cises of the palaestra as a servant or as a master ? and sc <lb/>
            if he had bought a physician or an architect. And so in <lb/>
            every matter, it is absolutely necessary that he who has <lb/>
            skill must be the superior of him who has not. Whoever <lb/>
            then generally possesses the science of life, what else must <lb/>
            he be than master ? For who is master in a ship ? The <lb/>
            man who governs the helm? Why? Because he who <lb/>
            will not obey him suffers for it. But a master can give <lb/>
            me stripes. Can he do it then without suffering for it ? So <lb/>
            I also used to think. But because he cannot do it without <lb/>
            suffering for it, for this reason it is not in his power : and <lb/>
            no man can do what is unjust without suffering for it. <lb/>
            And what is the penalty for him who puts his own slavey <lb/>
            in chains?40 what do you think that is? The fact of <lb/>

            if you choose to maintain the truth, that man is not a wild <lb/>
            beast, but a tame animal. For when is a vine doing badly ? <lb/>
            When it is in a condition contrary to its nature. When <lb/>
            is a cock? Just the same. Therefore a man also is so. <lb/>
            What then is a man's nature ? To bite, to kick, and to <lb/>
            throw into prison and to behead ? No; but to do good, <lb/>
            to co-operate with others, to wish them well. At that <lb/>
            time then he is in a bad condition, whether you chose to <lb/>
            admit it or not, when he is acting foolishly.</p>
          <p>Socrates then did not fare badly?-No; but his judges <lb/>
            and his accusers did.-Nor did Helvidius41 at Rome fare <lb/>
            badly ?-No; but his murderer did. How do you mean?- <lb/>
            The same as you do when you say that a cock has not <lb/>
            fared badly when he has gained the victory and been <lb/>
            severely wounded; but that the cock has fared badly when <lb/>
            he has been defeated and is unhurt: nor do you call a dog <lb/>
            fortunate, who neither pursues game nor labours, but <lb/>
            when you see him sweating,42 when you see him in pain <lb/>
            and panting violently after running. What paradox (un­ <lb/>
            usual thing) do we utter if we say that the evil in every <lb/>
            thing is that which is contrary to the nature of the thing ? <lb/>
            Is this a paradox ? for do you not say this in the case of <lb/>
            all other things? Why then in the case of man only do <lb/>
            you think differently ? But because we say that the nature <lb/>
            of man is tame (gentle) and social and faithful, you will <lb/>
            not say that this is a paradox?43 It is not- What then <lb/>
            is it a paradox to say that a man is not hurt when he is <lb/>
            whipped, or put in chains, or beheaded ? does he not, if he <lb/>
            suffers nobly, come off even with increased advantage and <lb/>
            profit ? But is he not hurt, who suffers in a most pitiful <lb/>
            and disgraceful way, who in place of a man becomes a <lb/>
            wolf, or viper or wasp ?</p>
          <p>Well then let us recapitulate the things which have <lb/>
            been agreed on. The man who is not under restraint is <lb/>
            free, to whom things are exactly in that state in which lie <lb/>
            wishes them to be; but he who can be restrained or com­ <lb/>
            pelled or hindered, or thrown into any circumstances <note type="footnote"> 41 See i. 2, note 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 42 I do not know if dogs sweat; at least in a state of health I have <lb/>
            never seen it. But this is a question for the learned in dog science. </note><note type="footnote"> 43 See Schweig.'s note. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            against his will, is a slave. But who is free from restraint? <lb/>
            He who desires nothing that belongs to (is in the power <lb/>
            of) others. And what are the things which belong to <lb/>
            others ? Those which are not in our power either to have <lb/>
            or not to have, or to have of a certain kind or in a certain <lb/>
            manner.44 Therefore the body belongs to another, the <lb/>
            parts of the body belong to another, possession (property) <lb/>
            belongs to another. If then you are attached to any of <lb/>
            these things as your own, you will pay the penalty which <lb/>
            it is proper for him to pay who desires what belongs to <lb/>
            another. This road leads to freedom, this is the only way <lb/>
            of escaping from slavery, to be able to say at last with all <lb/>
            your soul <lb/>
            Lead me, 0 Zeus, and thou 0 destiny, <lb/>
            The way that I am bid by you to go.45</p>
          <p>But what do you say, philosopher? The tyrant summons <lb/>
            you to say something which does not become you. Do you <lb/>
            say it or do you not ? Answer me—Let me consider-Will <lb/>
            you consider now ? But when you were in the school, what <lb/>
            was it which you used to consider ? Did you not study <lb/>
            what are the things that are good and what are bad, and <lb/>
            what things are neither one nor the other ?—I did.- What <lb/>
            then was our opinion ?-That just and honourable acts <lb/>
            were good; and that unjust and disgraceful (foul) acts <lb/>
            were bad.-Is life a good thing?-No.-Is death a bad <lb/>
            thing ?-No.-Is prison ?-No.-But what did we think <lb/>
            about mean and faithless words and betrayal of a friend <lb/>
            and flattery of a tyrant?-That they are bad.- Well then, <lb/>
            you are not considering, nor have you considered nor de­ <lb/>
            liberated. For what is the matter for consideration, is it <lb/>
            whether it is becoming for me, when I have it in my <lb/>
            power, to secure for myself the greatest of good things, <lb/>
            and not to secure for myself (that is, not to avoid) the <lb/>
            greatest evils ? A fine inquiry indeed, and necessary, and <lb/>
            one that demands much deliberation. Man, why do you <lb/>
            mock us? Such an inquiry is never made. If you really <note type="footnote"> 44 As Upton remarks, Epictetus is referring to the four categories of <lb/>

            imagined that base things were bad and honourable things <lb/>
            were good, and that all other things were neither good nor <lb/>
            bad, you would not even have approached this enquiry, <lb/>
            nor have come near it; but immediately you would have <lb/>
            been able to distinguish them by the understanding as you <lb/>
            would do (in other cases) by the vision. For when do <lb/>
            you inquire if black things are white, if heavy things are <lb/>
            light, and do not comprehend the manifest evidence of the <lb/>
            senses ? How then do you now say that you are consider­ <lb/>
            ing whether things which are neither good nor bad ought <lb/>
            to be avoided more than things which are bad ? But you <lb/>
            do not possess these opinions; and neither do these things <lb/>
            seem to you to be neither good nor bad, but you think <lb/>
            that they are the greatest evils; nor do you think those <lb/>
            other things (mean and faithless words, etc.) to be evils, but <lb/>
            matters which do not concern us at all. For thus from the <lb/>
            beginning you have accustomed yourself. Where am I? <lb/>
            In the schools : and are any listening to me ? I am discours­ <lb/>
            ing among philosophers. But I have gone out of the <lb/>
            school. Away with this talk of scholars and fools. Thus <lb/>
            a friend is overpowered by the testimony of a philosopher: :46 <lb/>
            thus a philosopher becomes a parasite; thus he lets him­ <lb/>
            self for hire for money: thus in the senate a man does not <lb/>
            say what he thinks; in private (in the sohool) he proclaims <lb/>
            his opinions.47 You are a cold and miserable little opinion, <lb/>

            you say that you are a man ? I should like to be present <lb/>
            when some of the philosophers is lying with a woman, that <lb/>
            I might see how he is exerting himself, and what words he <lb/>
            is uttering, and whether he remembers his title of philo­ <lb/>
            sopher, and the words which he hears or says or reads.</p>
          <p>And what is this to liberty? Nothing else than this, <lb/>
            whether you who are rich choose or not.-And who is <lb/>
            your evidence for this ?-who else than yourselves ? who <lb/>
            have a powerful master (Caesar), and who live in obedi­ <lb/>
            ence to his nod and motion, and who faint if he only looks <lb/>
            at you with a scowling countenance; you who court old <lb/>
            women48 and old men, and say, I cannot do this: it is not <lb/>
            in my power. Why is it not in your power ? Did you <lb/>
            not lately contend with me and say that you are free? <lb/>
            But Aprulla49 has hindered me? Tell the truth then, <lb/>
            slave, and do not run away from your masters, nor deny, <lb/>
            nor venture to produce any one to assert your freedom <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καρπιστήν</foreign>), when you have so many evidences of your <lb/>
            slavery. And indeed when a man is compelled by love to <lb/>
            do something contrary to his opinion (judgment), and at <lb/>
            the same time sees the better, but has not the strength to <lb/>
            follow it, one might consider him still more worthy of <lb/>
            excuse as being held by a certain violent and in a manner <lb/>
            a divine power.50 But who could endure you who are in <note type="footnote"> 48 Horace Sat. ii. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 49 Aprulla is a Roman woman's name. It means some old woman <lb/>
            who is courted for her money. </note><note type="footnote"> 50 Compare Plato (Symposium, p. 206): ' All men conceive both as to <lb/>
            the body and as to the soul, and when they have arrived at a certain age, <lb/>
            our nature desires to procreate. But it cannot procreate in that which <lb/>
            is ugly, but in that which is beautiful. For the conjunction of man and <lb/>
            woman is generation; but this act is divine, and this in the animal <lb/>
            which is mortal is divine, conceiving and begetting.' See what is said <lb/>
            in ii. 23, note 10 on marrying. In a certain sense the procreation of <lb/>
            children is a duty, and consequently the providing for them is also a <lb/>
            duty. It is the fulfilling of the will and purpose of the Deity to people <lb/>
            the earth; and therefore the act of procreation is divine. So a man'a <lb/>
            duty is to labour in some way, and if necessary, to earn his living and <lb/>
            sustain the life which he has received; and this is also a divine act. <lb/>
            Paul's opinion of marriage is contained in Or. i. 7. Some of his teach­ <lb/>
            ing on this matter has been justly condemned. He has no conception of <lb/>
            the true nature of marriage; at least he does not show that he has in </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            love with old women and old men, and wipe the old <lb/>
            women's noses, and wash them and give them presents, <lb/>
            and also wait on them like a slave when they are sick, <lb/>
            and at the same time wish them dead, and question the <lb/>
            physicians whether they are sick unto death ? And again, <lb/>
            when in order to obtain these great and much admired <lb/>
            magistracies and honours, you kiss the hands of these <lb/>
            slaves of others, and so you are not the slave even of free <lb/>
            men. Then you walk about before me in stately fashion <lb/>
            a praetor or a consul. Do I not know how you became a <lb/>
            praetor, by what means you got your consulship, who <lb/>
            gave it to you? I would not even choose to live, if I <lb/>
            must live by help of Felicion51 and endure his arrogance <lb/>
            and servile insolence : for I know what a slave is, who is <lb/>
            fortunate, as he thinks, and puffed up by pride.</p>
          <p>You then, a man may say, are you free? I wish, by the <lb/>
            Gods, and pray to be free; but I am not yet able to face <lb/>
            my masters, 1 still value my poor body, I value greatly <lb/>
            the preservation of it entire, though I do not possess it <lb/>
            entire.52 But I can point out to you a free man, that you <lb/>
            may no longer seek an example. Diogenes was free. <lb/>
            How was he free ?-not because he was born of free <lb/>
            parents,53 but because he was himself free, because he <lb/>
            had cast off all the handles of slavery, and it was not <lb/>
            possible for any man to approach him, nor had any man <lb/>
            the means of laying hold of him to enslave him. He had <lb/>
            everything easily loosed, everything only hanging to him. <lb/>
            If you laid hold of his property, he would have rather <lb/>
            let it go and be yours, than he would have followed you <lb/>
            for it: if you had laid hold of his leg, he would have let <lb/>
            go his leg; if of all his body, all his poor body; his <lb/>
            intimates, friends, country, just the same. For he knew <note type="footnote"> this chapter. His teaching is impracticable, contrary to that of Epictetus, <lb/>

            from whence he had them, and from whom, and on what <lb/>
            conditions. His true parents indeed, the Gods, and his <lb/>
            real country he would never have deserted, nor would he <lb/>
            have yielded to any man in obedience to them and to their <lb/>
            orders, nor would any man have died for his country more <lb/>
            readily. For he was not used to inquire when he should <lb/>
            he considered to have done anything on behalf of the whole <lb/>
            of things (the universe, or all the world), but he remem. <lb/>
            bered that every thing which is done comes from thence <lb/>
            and is done on behalf of that country and is commanded <lb/>
            by him who administers it.54 Therefore see what Dio­ <lb/>
            genes himself says and writes :-" For this reason, he <lb/>
            says, Diogenes, it is in your power to speak both with <lb/>
            the King of the Persians and with Archidamus the king <lb/>
            of the Lacedaemonians, as you please." Was it because <lb/>
            he was born of free parents ? I suppose all the Athenians <lb/>
            and all the Lacedaemonians because they were born <lb/>
            of slaves, could not talk with them (these kings) as <lb/>
            they wished, but feared and paid court to them. Why <lb/>
            then does he say that it is in his power ? Because I do <lb/>
            not consider the poor body to be my own, because I want <lb/>
            nothing, because law55 is every thing to me, and nothing <lb/>
            else is. These were the things which permitted him to be <lb/>
            free.</p>
          <p>And that you may not think that I show you the ex­ <lb/>

            whom he could be bent and drawn in various directions, <lb/>
            take Socrates and observe that he had a wife and children, <lb/>
            but he did not consider them as his own ; that he had a <lb/>
            country, so long as it was fit to have one, and in such a <lb/>
            manner as was fit; friends and kinsmen also, but he held <lb/>
            all in subjection to law and to the obedience due to it. <lb/>
            For this reason he was the first to go out as a soldier, when <lb/>
            it was necessary, and in war he exposed himself to danger <note type="footnote"> 54 Schweig. has a note on this difficult passage, which is rather <lb/>

            because he thought that it was a base action, and he knew <lb/>
            that he must die (for his refusal), if it so happened.58 <lb/>
            And what difference did that make to him ? for he in­ <lb/>
            tended to preserve something else, not his poor flesh, but <lb/>
            his fidelity, his honourable character. These are things <lb/>
            which could not be assailed nor brought into subjection. <lb/>
            Then when he was obliged to speak in defence of his life, <lb/>
            did he behave like a man who had children, who had a <lb/>
            wife ? No, but he behaved like a man who has neither. <lb/>
            And what did he do when he was (ordered) to drink the <lb/>
            poison,59 and when he had the power of escaping from <lb/>
            prison, and when Crito said to him, Escape for the sake of <lb/>
            your children, what did Socrates say?60 did he consider <lb/>
            the power of escape as an unexpected gain? By no <lb/>
            means: he considered what was fit and proper; but the <lb/>
            rest he did not even look at or take into the reckoning. <lb/>
            For he did not choose, he said, to save his poor body, but <lb/>
            to save that which is increased and saved by doing what <lb/>
            is just, and is impaired and destroyed by doing what is <lb/>
            unjust.. Socrates will not save his life by a base act; he <lb/>

            the commanders from collecting and honorably burying those who fell <lb/>
            in the battle; and the Athenians after their hasty fashion, wished all <lb/>
            the commanders to be put to death. But Socrates, who was in office <lb/>
            at this time, resisted the unjust clamour of the people. Xenophon <lb/>

            the tyiants, he who discoursed in such a manner about <lb/>
            virtue and right behaviour. It is not possible to save <lb/>
            such a man's life by base acts, but he is saved by dying, <lb/>
            not by running away. For the good actor also preserves <lb/>
            his character by stopping when he ought to stop, better <lb/>
            than when he goes on acting beyond the proper time. <lb/>
            What then shall the children of Socrates do? "If," said <lb/>
            Socrates, " I had gone off to Thessaly, would you have <lb/>
            taken care of them; and if I depart to the world below, <lb/>
            will there be no man to take care of them ?" See how he <lb/>
            gives to death a gentle name and mocks it. But if you <lb/>
            and I had been in his place, we should have immediately <lb/>
            answered as philosophers that those who act unjustly must <lb/>
            be repaid in the same way, and we should have added, " I <lb/>
            shall be useful to many, if my life is saved, and if I die, <lb/>
            I bhall be useful to no man." For, if it had been neces­ <lb/>
            sary, we should have made our escape by slipping through <lb/>
            a small hole. And how in that case should we have been <lb/>
            useful to any man ? for where would they have been then <lb/>
            staying?62 or if we were useful to men while we were <lb/>
            alive, should we not have been much more useful to <lb/>
            them by dying when we ought to die, and as we ought ? <lb/>
            And now Socrates being dead, no less useful to men, and <lb/>
            even more useful, is the remembrance of that which he did <lb/>
            or said when he was alive.63 <note type="footnote"> 62 The original is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποῦ γὰρ ἃν ἔτι ἔμενον ἐκεῖνοι</foreign> ; this seems to mean, <lb/>
            if we had escaped and left the country, where would those have been to <lb/>
            whom we might have been useful ? They would have been left behind, <lb/>
            and we could have done nothing for them. </note><note type="footnote"> 63 This is the conclusion about Socrates, whom Epictetus highly <lb/>
            valued: the remembrance of what Socrates did and said is even more <lb/>
            useful than his life. “ The life of the dead,” says Cicero of Servius <lb/>
            Sulpicius, the great Roman jurist and Cicero's friend, " rests in the <lb/>
            remembrance of the living." Epictetus has told us of some of the acts <lb/>
            of Socrates, which prove him to have been a. brave and honest man- <lb/>
            Ho does not tell us here what Socrates said, which means what he <lb/>
            taught; but he knew what it was. Modern writers have expounded <lb/>
            the matter at length, and in a form which Epictetus would not or <lb/>
            could not have used.—Socrates left to others the questions which relate <lb/>
            to the material world, and he first taught, as we are told, the things <lb/>
            which concern man's daily life and his intercourse with other men: in <lb/>
            other words he taught Ethic (the principles of morality). Fields and <lb/>
            trees, he said, will teach me nothing, but man in his social state will; <lb/>
            and man then is the proper subject of the philosophy of Socrates. The <lb/>
            beginning of this knowledge was. as he said, to know himself according </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            Think of these things, these opinions, these words: look <lb/>
            to these examples, if you would be free, if you desire the <lb/>
            thing according to its worth. And what is the wonder <lb/>
            if you buy so great a thing at the price of things so many <lb/>
            and so great ? For the sake of this which is called liberty, <lb/>
            some hang themselves, others throw themselves down pre­ <lb/>
            cipices, and sometimes even whole cities have perished: <lb/>
            and will you not for the sake of the true and unassailable <lb/>
            and secure liberty give back to God when he demands <lb/>
            them the things which he has given ? Will you not, as <lb/>
            Plato says, study not to die only, but also to endure tor­ <lb/>
            ture, and exile, and scourging and in a word to give up <lb/>
            all which is not your own ? If you will not, you will be <note type="footnote"> to the precept of the Delphic oracle, Know thyself (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γνῶθι σεαυτόν</foreign>) : <lb/>
            and the object of his philosophy was to comprehend the nature of man <lb/>
            as a moral being in all relations; and among these the relation of man <lb/>
            to God as the father of all, creator and ruler of all, as Plato expresses <lb/>
            it. Socrates taught that what wo call death is not the end of man; <lb/>
            death is only the road to another life. The death of Socrates was con­ <lb/>
            formable to his life and teaching. " Socrates died not only with the <lb/>
            noblest courage and tranquillity, but he also refused, as we are told, to <lb/>
            escape from death, which the laws of the state permitted, by going into <lb/>
            exile or paying a fine, because as he said, if he had himself consented <lb/>
            to a fine or allowed others to propose it, (Xenophon, Apol. § 22), such <lb/>
            an act would have been an admission of his guilt. Both (Socrates <lb/>
            and Jesus) offered themselves with the firmest resolution for a holy <lb/>
            cause, which was so far from being lost through their death that it <lb/>
            only served rather to make it the general cause of mankind." (Das <lb/>
            Christliche des Platonismus oder Socrates und Christus, by F. C. Baur.) </note><note type="footnote"> This essay by Baur is very ingenious. Perhaps there are some <lb/>
            readers who will disagree with him on many points in the comparison <lb/>
            of Socrates and Christus. However the essay is well worth the trouble <lb/>
            of reading. </note><note type="footnote"> The opinion of Rousseau in his comparison of Jesus and Socrates is <lb/>
            in some respects more just than that of Baur, though the learning of <lb/>

            “What prejudices, what blindness must a man have," says Rousseau, <lb/>
            when he dares to compare the son of Sophroniscus with the son of <lb/>
            Mary!—The death of SOl'rates philosophising tranquilly with his <lb/>
            friends is the most gentle that a man could desire; that of Jesus ex­ <lb/>
            piring in torments, insulted, jeered, cursed by a whole people, is tho <lb/>
            most horrible that a man could dread. Socrates taking the poisoned <lb/>
            cup blesses him who presents it and weeps; Jesus in his horrible <lb/>
            punishment prays for his savage executioners. Yes, if the life and the <lb/>

            not yet obtained them there is an imagination (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>), <lb/>
            that when these things are come, all that is good will <lb/>
            come with them; then, when they are come, the feverish <lb/>
            feeling is the same, the tossing to and fro is the same, <lb/>
            the satiety, the desire of things which are not present; <lb/>
            for freedom is acquired not by the full possession of the <lb/>
            things which are desired, but by removing the desire. <lb/>
            And that you may know that this is true, as you have <lb/>
            laboured for those things, so transfer your labour to these; <lb/>
            be vigilant for the purpose of acquiring an opinion which <lb/>
            will make you free; pay court to a philosopher instead of <lb/>
            to a rich old man : be seen about a philosopher's doors: <lb/>
            you will not disgrace yourself by being seen; you will <lb/>
            not go away empty nor without profit, if you go to the <lb/>
            philosopher as you ought, and if not (if you do not suc­ <lb/>
            ceed), try at least: the trial (attempt) is not disgraceful.</p>

            never so closely connected with any of your former in­ <lb/>
            timates or friends as to come down to the same acts as he <lb/>
            does.1 If you do not observe this rule, you will ruin your­ <lb/>
            self. But if the thought arises in your mind, " I shall <lb/>
            seem disobliging to him and he will not have the samo <lb/>

            out cost, nor is it possible for a man if he does not do the <lb/>
            same things to be the same man that he was. Choose <lb/>
            then which of the two you will have, to be equally loved <lb/>
            by those by whom you were formerly loved, being the <lb/>
            same with your former self; or being superior, not to <lb/>
            obtain from your friends the same that you did before. <lb/>
            For if this is better, immediately turn away to it, and let <lb/>
            not other considerations draw you in a different direction. <lb/>
            For no man is able to make progress (improvement), when <lb/>
            he is wavering between opposite things; but if you have <lb/>
            preferred this (one thing) to all things, if you choose to <lb/>
            attend to this only, to work out this only, give up every <lb/>
            thing else. But if you will not do this, your wavering <lb/>
            will produce both these results: you will neither improve <lb/>
            as you ought, nor will you obtain what you formerly <lb/>
            obtained. For before by plainly desiring the things <lb/>
            which were worth nothing, you pleased your associates. <lb/>
            But you cannot excel in both kinds, and it is necessary <lb/>
            that so far as you share in the one, you must fall short in <lb/>
            the other. You cannot, when you do not drink with those <lb/>
            with whom you used to drink, be agreeable to them as you <lb/>
            were before. Choose then whether you will be a hard <lb/>
            drinker and pleasant to your former associates or a sober <lb/>
            man and disagreeable to them. You cannot, when you do <lb/>
            not sing with those with whom you used to sing, be <lb/>
            equally loved by them. Choose then in this matter also <lb/>
            which of the two you will have. For if it is better to be <lb/>
            modest and orderly than for a man to say, He is a jolly <lb/>
            fellow, give up the rest, renounce it, turn away from it, <lb/>
            have nothing to do with such men. But if this behaviour <lb/>
            shall not please you, turn altogether to the opposite: be­ <lb/>
            come a catamite, an adulterer, and act accordingly, and <lb/>
            you will get what you wish. And jump up in the theatre <lb/>
            and bawl out in praise of the dancer. But characters so <lb/>
            different cannot be mingled: you cannot act both Thersites <lb/>
            and Agamemnon. If you intend to be Thersites,2 you <lb/>
            must be humpbacked and bald: if Agamemnon, you must <lb/>
            be tall and handsome, and love those who are placed in <lb/>
            obedience to you. <note type="footnote"> 2See Iliad, ii. 216; and for the description of Agamemnon, Iliad, <lb/>

          <p>KEEP this thought in readiness, when you lose any thing <lb/>
            external, what you acquire in place of it; and if it be <lb/>
            worth more, never say, I have had a loss; neither1 if you <lb/>
            have got a horse in place of an ass, or an ox in place of a <lb/>
            sheep, nor a good action in place of a bit of money, nor in <lb/>
            place of idle talk such tranquillity as befits a man, nor in <lb/>
            place of lewd talk if you have acquired modesty. If you <lb/>
            remember this, you will always maintain your character <lb/>
            such as it ought to be. But if you do not, consider that <lb/>
            the times of opportunity are perishing, and that whatever <lb/>
            pains you take about yourself, you are going to waste <lb/>
            them all and overturn them. And it needs only a few <lb/>
            things for the loss and overturning of all, namely a small <lb/>
            deviation from reason. For the steerer of a ship to upset it, <lb/>
            he has no need of the same means as he has need of for <lb/>
            saving it: but if he turns it a little to the wind, it is <lb/>
            lost; and if he does not do this purposely, but has been <lb/>
            neglecting his duty a little, the ship is lost. Something <lb/>
            of the kind happens in this case also: if you only fall <lb/>
            a nodding a little, all that you have up to this time <lb/>
            collected is gone. Attend therefore to the appearances of <lb/>
            things, and watch over them ; for that which you have to <lb/>
            preserve is no small matter, but it is modesty and fidelity <lb/>
            and constancy, freedom from the affects, a state of mind <lb/>
            undisturbed, freedom from fear, tranquillity, in a word <lb/>
            liberty. For what will you sell these things ? See what <lb/>
            is the value of the things which you will obtain in ex­ <lb/>
            change for these.—But shall I not obtain any such thing <lb/>
            for it ?-See, and if you do in return get that, see what <lb/>
            you receive in place of it.2 I possess decency, he possesses <lb/>
            a tribuneship: he possesses a praetorship, I possess <lb/>

            for I am free, and a friend of God, and so I obey him <lb/>

            neither body nor possession, nor magistracy, nor good re • <lb/>
            port, nor in fact any thing. For he (God) does not allow <lb/>
            me to claim (seek) them: for if he had chosen, he would <lb/>
            have made them good for me ; but he has not done so, and <lb/>
            for this reason 1 cannot transgress his commands.4 Preserve <lb/>
            that which is your own good in every thing; and as to every <lb/>
            other thing, as it is permitted, and so far as to behave con­ <lb/>

          <p>REMEMBER that not only the desire of power and of riches <lb/>
            makes us mean and subject to others, but even the desire <lb/>
            of tranquillity, and of leisure, and of travelling abroad, <lb/>
            and of learning. For to speak plainly, whatever the <lb/>
            external thing may be, the value which we set upon it <lb/>
            places us in subjection to others. What then is the dif­ <lb/>
            ference between desiring to be a senator or not desiring <lb/>
            to be one; what is the difference between desiring power <lb/>

            tranquil and happy life (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔσοια</foreign>) ? But if reading does not <lb/>

            a tranquil and happy life contains nothing so sure as con­ <lb/>

          <p>Come, when you have done these things and have at­ <lb/>
            tended to them, have you done a worse act than when you <lb/>

            both when you approach Caesar, and when you approach <lb/>
            any person ? If you maintain yourself free from pertur­ <lb/>
            bation, free from alarm, and steady; if you look rather at <lb/>
            the things which are done and happen than are looked at <lb/>

            with fear or admiration, what do you want? Books? How <lb/>
            or for what purpose? for is not this (the reading of <lb/>
            books) a preparation for life? and is not life itself <lb/>
            (living) made up of certain other things than this ? This <lb/>
            is just as if an athlete should weep when he enters the <lb/>
            stadium, because he is not being exercised outside of it. <lb/>
            It was for this purpose that you used to practise exercise ; <lb/>
            for this purpose were used the haltéres (weights),6 the dust, <lb/>
            the young men as antagonists; and do you seek for those <lb/>
            things now when it is the time of action ? This is just as <lb/>
            if in the topic (matter) of assent when appearances pre­ <lb/>
            sent themselves, some of which can be comprehended, and <lb/>
            Rome cannot be comprehended, we should not choose to <lb/>
            distinguish them but should choose to read what has been <lb/>
            written about comprehension (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατάληψις</foreign>).</p>
          <p>What then is the reason of this ? The reason is that <lb/>
            we have never read for this purpose, we have never written <lb/>
            for this purpose, so that we may in our actions use in away <lb/>
            conformable to nature the appearances presented to us; <lb/>
            but we terminate in this, in learning what is said, and in <lb/>
            being able to expound it to another, in resolving a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism,7 and in handling the hypothetical syllogism. For <note type="footnote"> 6 See 1. 4. note 5, iii. 15.4; and i. 24.1, i. 29.34. The athletes were <lb/>

            this reason where our study (purpose) is, there alone is <lb/>
            the impediment. Would you have by all means the <lb/>
            things which are not in your power? Be prevented <lb/>
            then, be hindered, fail in your purpose. But if we read <lb/>
            what is written about action (efforts, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρμή</foreign>),8 not that we <lb/>
            may see what is said about action, but that we may act <lb/>
            well: if we read what is said about desire and aversion <lb/>
            (avoiding things), in order that we may neither fail in <lb/>
            our desires, nor fall into that which we try to avoid; if <lb/>
            we read what is said about duty (officium), in order that <lb/>
            remembering the relations (of things to one another) we <lb/>
            may do nothing irrationally nor contrary to these rela­ <lb/>
            tions ; we should not be vexed in being hindered as to our <lb/>
            readings, but we should be satisfied with doing the acts <lb/>
            which are conformable (to the relations), and we should <lb/>
            be reckoning not what so far we have been accustomed to <lb/>
            reckon: To-day I have read so many verses, I have written <lb/>
            so many; but (we should say), To-day I have employed <lb/>
            my action as it is taught by the philosophers; I have not <lb/>
            employed my desire ; I have used avoidance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλίσει</foreign>) only <lb/>
            with respect to things which are within the power of my <lb/>
            will; I have not been afraid of such a person, I have not <lb/>
            been prevailed upon by the entreaties of another; I have <lb/>
            exercised my patience,9 my abstinence, my co-operation <lb/>
            with others ; and so we should thank God for what we <lb/>
            ought to thank him.</p>
          <p>But now we do not know that we also in another way <lb/>
            are like the many. Another man is afraid that he shall <lb/>
            not have power: you are afraid that you will. Do not do <lb/>
            so, my man ; but as you ridicule him who is afraid that he <lb/>
            shall not have power, so ridicule yourself also. For it <lb/>
            makes no difference whether you are thirsty like a man <lb/>
            who has a fever, or have a dread of water like a man who <lb/>
            is mad. Or how will you still be able to say as Socrates <lb/>
            did, If so it pleases God, so let it be? Do you think that <lb/>
            Socrates if he had been eager to pass his leisure in the <lb/>
            Lyceum or in the Academy and to discourse daily with <lb/>
            the young men, would have readily served in military <note type="footnote"> 8 See iii. c. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 See Aulus Gellius xvii. 19, where he quotes Epictetus on what <lb/>

            expeditions so often as he did; and would he not have <lb/>
            lamented and groaned, Wretch that I am; I must now <lb/>
            be miserable here, when I might be sunning myself in the <lb/>
            Lyceum? Why, was this your business, to sun yourself? <lb/>
            And is it not your business to be happy, to be free from <lb/>
            hindrance, free from impediment ? And could he still have <lb/>
            been Socrates, if he had lamented in this way : how would <lb/>
            he still have been able to write Paeans in his prison ?10</p>
          <p>In short remember this, that what you shall piize which <lb/>
            is beyond your will, so far you have destroyed your will. <lb/>
            But these things are out of the power of the will, not <lb/>
            only power (authority), but also a private condition: not <lb/>
            only occupation (business), but also leisure.-Now then <lb/>
            must I live in this tumult ?- Why do you say tumult?—I <lb/>
            mean among many men.—Well what is the hardship? <lb/>
            Suppose that you are at Olympia: imagine it to be a <lb/>
            panegyris (public assembly), where one is calling out one <lb/>
            thing, another is doing another thing, and a third is push­ <lb/>
            ing another person: in the baths there is a crowd: and <lb/>
            who of us is not pleased with this assembly, and leaves it <lb/>
            unwillingly? Be not difficult to please nor fastidious <lb/>
            about what happens.-Vinegar is disagreeable, for it is <lb/>
            sharp; honey is disagreeable, for it disturbs my habit of <lb/>
            body. I do not like vegetables. So also I do not like leisure ; <lb/>
            it is a desert: I do not like a crowd; it is confusion.- <lb/>
            But if circumstances make it necessary for you to live <lb/>
            alone or with a few, call it quiet, and use the thing as you <lb/>
            ought: talk with yourself, exercise the appearances (pre­ <lb/>
            sented to you), work up your preconceptions.11 If you <lb/>
            fall into a crowd, call it a celebration of games, a panegyris, <lb/>
            a festival: try to enjoy the festival with other men. For <lb/>
            what is a more pleasant sight to him who loves mankind <lb/>
            than a number of men ? We see with pleasure herds of <lb/>
            horses or oxen : we are delighted when we see many ships: <lb/>
            who is pained when he sees many men?—But they deafen <lb/>
            me with their cries.-Then your hearing is impeded. <lb/>
            What then is this to you ? Is then the power of making <lb/>
            use of appearances hindered? And who prevents you <note type="footnote"> 10 Plato in the Phaedon (c. 4) says that Socrates in his prison wrote <lb/>

            from using according to nature inclination to a thing and <lb/>
            aversion from it; and movement towards a thing and move­ <lb/>
            ment from it? What tumult (confusion) is able to do <lb/>
            this ?</p>
          <p>Do you only bear in mind the general rules: what is <lb/>
            mine, what is not mine; what is given (permitted) to me; <lb/>
            what does God will that I should do now ? what does he <lb/>
            not will ? A little before he willed you to be at leisure, <lb/>
            to talk with yourself, to write about these things, to read, <lb/>
            to hear, to prepare yourself. You had sufficient time for <lb/>
            this. Now he says to you : Come now to the contest, <lb/>
            show us what you have learned, how you have practised <lb/>
            the athletic art. How long will you be exercised alone ? <lb/>
            Now is the opportunity for you to learn whether you are <lb/>
            an athlete worthy of victory, or one of those who go about <lb/>
            the world and are defeated. Why then are you vexed? <lb/>
            No contest is without confusion. There must be many <lb/>
            who exercise themselves for the contest, many who call <lb/>
            out to those who exercise themselves, many masters, many <lb/>
            spectators.-But my wish is to live quietly.-Lament then <lb/>
            and groan as you deserve to do. For what other is a <lb/>
            greater punishment than this to the untaught man and to <lb/>
            him who disobeys the divine commands, to be grieved, to <lb/>
            lament, to envy, in a word to be disappointed and to be <lb/>
            unhappy? Would you not release yourself from these <lb/>
            things ?-And how shall I release myself?-Have you not <lb/>
            often heard, that you ought to remove entirely desire, <lb/>
            apply aversion (turning away) to those things only which <lb/>
            are within your power, that you ought to give up every <lb/>
            thing, body, property, fame, books, tumult, power, private <lb/>
            station? for whatever way you turn, you are a slave, you <lb/>
            are subjected, you are hindered, you are compelled, you <lb/>
            are entirely in the power of others. But keep the words <lb/>
            of Cleanthes in readiness. <lb/>
            Lead me, 0 Zeus, and thou necessity. IS</p>
          <p>Is it your will that I should go to Rome ? I will go to <lb/>
            Rome. To Gyara ? I will go to Gyara. To Athens ? I <note type="footnote"> 12 Compare Encheiridion, 52. Cleanthes was a Stoic philosopher, <lb/>
            who also wrote some poetry. See p. 292, note. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            will go to Athens. To prison ? I will go to prison. If <lb/>
            you should once say, When shall a man go to Athens? <lb/>
            you are undone. It is a necessary consequence that this <lb/>
            desire, if it is not accomplished, must make you unhappy; <lb/>
            and if it is accomplished, it must make you vain, since <lb/>
            you are elated at things at which you ought not to be <lb/>
            elated; and on the other hand, if you are impeded, it <lb/>
            must make you wretched because you fall into that which <lb/>
            you would not fall into. Give up then all these things.- <lb/>
            Athens is a good place.-But happiness is much better; <lb/>
            and to be free from passions, free from disturbance, for <lb/>
            your affairs not to depend on any man. There is tumult <lb/>
            at Rome and visits of salutation.13 But happiness is an <lb/>
            equivalent for all troublesome things. If then the time <lb/>
            comes for these things, why do you not take away the wish <lb/>
            to avoid them ? what necessity is there to carry a burden <lb/>
            like an ass, and to be beaten with a stick ? But if you do <lb/>
            not so, consider that you must always be a slave to him <lb/>
            who has it in his power to effect your release, and also to <lb/>
            impede you, and you must serve him as an evil genius.14</p>
          <p>There is only one way to happiness, and let this rule be <lb/>
            ready both in the morning and during the day and by <lb/>
            night: the rule is not to look towards things which are <lb/>
            out of the power of our will, to think that nothing is our <lb/>
            own, to give up all things to the Divinity, to Fortune; to <lb/>
            make them the superintendents of these things, whom <lb/>
            Zeus also has made so; for a man to observe that only <lb/>
            which is his own, that which cannot be hindered; and <lb/>
            when we read, to refer our reading to this only, and our <lb/>
            writing and our listening. For this reason I cannot call <lb/>
            the man industrious, if I hear this only, that he reads and <lb/>
            writes; and even if a man adds that he reads all night, I <lb/>
            cannot say so, if he knows not to what he should refer his <lb/>
            reading. For neither do you say that a man is industrious <lb/>
            if he keeps awake for a girl;15 nor do I. But if he does <lb/>
            it (reads and writes) for reputation, I say that he is a <note type="footnote"> 13 He alludes to the practice of dependents paying formal visits in <lb/>

            lover of reputation. And if he does it for m , I say <lb/>
            that he is a lover of money, not a lover of labo and if <lb/>
            he does it through love of learning, I say that he a lover <lb/>
            of learning, But if he refers his labour to his owil ruling <lb/>
            power (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡγεμονικόν</foreign>), that he may keep it in a state con­ <lb/>
            formable to nature and pass his life in that state, then only <lb/>
            do I say that he is industrious. For never commend a <lb/>
            man on account of these things which are common to all, <lb/>
            but on account of his opinions (principles); for these are <lb/>
            the things which belong to each man, which make his <lb/>
            actions bad or good. Remembering these rules, rejoice in <lb/>
            that which is present, and be content with the things <lb/>
            which come in season.16 If you see any thing which you <lb/>
            have learned and inquired about occurring to you in your <lb/>
            course of life (or opportunely applied by you to the acts of <lb/>
            life), be delighted at it. If you have laid aside or have <lb/>
            lessened bad disposition and a habit of reviling; if you <lb/>
            have done so with rash temper, obscene words, hastiness, <lb/>
            sluggishness ; if you are not moved by what you formerly <lb/>
            were, and not in the same way as you once were, you can <lb/>
            celebrate a festival daily, to-day because you have behaved <lb/>
            well in one act, and to-morrow because you have behaved <lb/>
            well in another. How much greater is this a reason for <lb/>
            making sacrifices than a consulship or the government of <lb/>
            a province ? These things come to you from yourself and <lb/>
            from the gods. Remember this, who gives these things <lb/>
            and to whom, and for what purpose. If you cherish your­ <lb/>
            self in these thoughts, do you still think that it makes any <lb/>
            difference where you shall be happy, where you shall <lb/>
            please God? Are not the gods equally distant from all <lb/>
            places ?17 Do they not see from all places alike that which <lb/>
            is going on ? <note type="footnote"> 16 See Antoninus, vi. 2; and ix. 6 ‘ Thy present opinion founded on <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE wise and good man neither himself fights with any <lb/>
            person, nor dues he allow another, so far as he can pre­ <lb/>
            vent it. And an example of this as well as of all other <lb/>
            things is proposed to us in the life of Socrates, who not <lb/>
            only himself on all occasions avoided fights (quarrels), but <lb/>
            would not allow oven others to quarrel. See in Xenophon's <lb/>
            Symposium1 how many quarrels he settled, how further <lb/>
            he endured Thrasymachus and Polus and Callicles; how <lb/>
            he tolerated his wife, and how he tolerated his son 2 who <lb/>
            attempted to confute him and to cavil with him. For he <lb/>
            remembered well that no man has in his power another <lb/>
            man's ruling principle. He wished therefore for nothing <lb/>
            else than that which was his own. And what is this? <lb/>
            Not that this or that man may act according to nature; <lb/>
            for that is a thing which belongs to another; but that <lb/>
            while others are doing their own acts, as they choose, he <lb/>
            may never the less be in a condition conformable to <lb/>
            nature and live in it, only doing what is his own to the <lb/>
            end that others also may be in a state conformable to <lb/>
            nature. For this is the object always set before him by <lb/>
            the wise and good man. Is it to be commander (a <lb/>
            praetor) 3 of an army ? No : but if it is permitted him, <lb/>
            his object is in this matter to maintain his own ruling <lb/>
            principle. Is it to marry ? No; but if marriage is allowed <lb/>
            to him, in this matter his object is to maintain himself in <lb/>
            a condition conformable to nature. But if he would have <lb/>
            his son not to do wrong or his wife, he would have what <lb/>
            belongs to another not to belong to another: and to be <lb/>
            instructed is this, to learn what things are a man's own <lb/>
            and what belongs to another.</p>
          <p>How then is there left any place for fighting (quarrel­ <lb/>
            ling) to a man who has this opinion (which he ought to <lb/>
            have)? Is he surprised at any thing which happens, <note type="footnote"> 1 See ii. 12. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Xenophon, Memorabilia, ii. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατηγῆαι</foreign> may be translated either way. </note> <lb/>

            and does it appear new to him ? 4 Does he not expect <lb/>
            that which comes from the bad to be worse and more <lb/>
            grievous than what actually befals him ? And does he not <lb/>
            reckon as pure gain whatever they (the bad) may do <lb/>
            which falls short of extreme wickedness ? Such a person <lb/>
            has reviled you. Great thanks to him for not having <lb/>
            struck you. But he has struck me also. Great thanks <lb/>
            that he did not wound you. But he wounded me also. <lb/>
            Great thanks that he did not kill you. For when did he <lb/>
            learn or in what school that man is a tame5 animal, that <lb/>
            men love one another, that an act of injustice is a great <lb/>
            harm to him who does it. Since then lie has not learned <lb/>
            this and is not convinced of it, why shall he not follow <lb/>
            that which seems to be for his own interest? Your <lb/>
            neighbour has thrown stones. Have you then done any <lb/>
            thing wrong? But the things in the house have been <lb/>
            broken. Are you then a utensil? No; but a free power <lb/>
            of will.6 What then is given to you (to do) in answer to <lb/>
            this ? If you are like a wolf, you must bite in return, and <lb/>
            throw more stones. But if you consider what is proper <lb/>
            for a man, examine your storehouse, see with what facul­ <lb/>
            ties you came into the world. Have you the disposition <lb/>
            of a wild beast, have you the disposition of revenge for an <lb/>
            injury? When is a horse wretched? When he is deprived <lb/>
            of his natural faculties, not when be cannot crow like a <lb/>
            cock, but when he cannot run. When is a dog wretched? <lb/>
            Not when he cannot fly, but when he cannot track his <lb/>
            game. Is then a man also unhappy in this way, not <lb/>
            because he cannot strangle lions or embrace statues,7 for <lb/>
            he did not come into the world in the possession of certain <lb/>
            powers from nature for this purpose, but because he has <lb/>
            lost his probity and his fidelity? People ought to meet <lb/>

            For what wall is so strong, or what body is so hard, or <lb/>
            what possession is so safe, or what honour (rank, character) <lb/>

            things every where are perishable, easily taken by assault, <lb/>

            find his desires disappointed, and fall into things which <lb/>

            1 do not require pity.-And whether then are you in the <lb/>
            condition of not deserving (requiring) pity, or are you not <lb/>
            in that condition ?—I think that I am not: but these <lb/>
            persons do not pity me, for the things for which, if they <lb/>
            ought to pity me, it would be proper, I mean, for my <lb/>

              Is this what you have been earnest about doing,2 to learn <lb/>
              to be free from grief and free from disturbance, and not to <lb/>
              be humbled (abject), and to be free? Have you not heard <lb/>

              to give up (dismiss) the things which do not depend on <lb/>
              the will, to withdraw from them, and to admit that they <lb/>

            yet neither in the exercises of the palaestra, nor in writing <lb/>

            signs (plans), and in other acts suitable to a man? But do <lb/>
            you trouble yourself about this, whether others pity you ? <lb/>
            —Yes, but I am pitied not as I ought to be.-Are you then <lb/>
            pained at this ? and is he who is pained, an object of pity ? <lb/>
            —Yes—How then are you pitied not as you ought to be? <lb/>
            For by the very act that you feel (suffer) about being <lb/>
            pitied, you make yourself deserving of pity. What then <lb/>
            says Antisthenes? Have you not heard? 'It is a royal <lb/>
            thing, 0 Cyrus, to do right (well) and to be in spoken of.'4 <lb/>
            My head is sound, and all think that I have the head ache. <lb/>
            What do I care for that ? I am free from fever, and people <lb/>
            sympathize with me as if I had a fever, (and say), Poor <lb/>
            man, for so long a time you have not ceased to have fever. <lb/>
            I also say with a sorrowful countenance, In truth it is now <lb/>
            a long time that I have been ill. What will happen then ? <lb/>
            As God may please: and at the same time I secretly laugh <lb/>
            at those who are pitying me. What then hinders the <lb/>
            same being done in this case also ? I am poor, but I have <lb/>
            a right opinion about poveity. Why then do I care if <lb/>
            they pity me for my poverty ? I am not in power (not a <lb/>
            magistrate); but others are: and I have the opinion which <lb/>
            I ought to have about having and not having power. Let <lb/>
            them look to it who pity me :5 but I am neither hungry <lb/>
            nor thirsty nor do I suffer cold; but because they are <lb/>
            hungry or thirsty they think that I too am. What then <lb/>
            shall I do for them? Shall I go about and proclaim and <lb/>
            say, Be not mistaken, men, I am very well, I do not trouble <lb/>
            myself about poverty, nor want of power, nor in a word <lb/>
            about anything else than right opinions. These I have <lb/>
            free from restraint, I care for nothing at all.- What foolish <lb/>
            talk is this ? How do I possess right opinions when I am <lb/>
            not content with being what I am, but am uneasy about <lb/>
            what I am supposed to be ?</p>
          <p>But you say, others will get more and be preferred to <lb/>
            me—What then is more reasonable than for those who <lb/>
            have laboured about any thing to have more in that thing <lb/>
            in which they have laboured? They have laboured for <lb/>
            power, you have laboured about opinions; and they have <lb/>
            laboured for wealth, you for the proper use of appearances. <note type="footnote"> 4 M. Antoninus, vii. 36. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄψονται</foreign>. See i. 4, note 4. </note> <lb/>

            See if they have more than you in this about which you <lb/>
            have laboured, and which they neglect; if they assent <lb/>
            better than you with respect to the natural rules (measures) <lb/>
            of things; if they are less disappointed than you in their <lb/>
            desires; if they fall less into things which they would <lb/>
            avoid than you do ; if in their intentions, if in the things <lb/>
            which they propose to themselves, if in their purposes, if in <lb/>
            their motions towards an object they take a better aim; if <lb/>
            they better observe a proper behaviour, as men, as sons, as <lb/>
            parents, and so on as to the other names by which we <lb/>
            express the relations of life. But if they exercise power, <lb/>
            and you do not, will you not choose to tell yourself the <lb/>
            truth, that you do nothing for the sake of this (power), and <lb/>
            they do all? But it is most unreasonable that he who <lb/>
            looks after anything should obtain less than he who does. <lb/>
            not look after it.</p>
          <p>Not so: but since I care about right opinions, it is more <lb/>
            reasonable for mo to have power.—Yes in the matter about <lb/>
            which you do care, in opinions. But in a matter in which, <lb/>
            they have cared more than you, give way to them. The <lb/>
            case is just the same as if because you have right opinions, <lb/>
            you thought that in using the bow you should hit the <lb/>
            mark better than an archer, and in working in metal you <lb/>
            should succeed better than a smith. Give up then your <lb/>
            earnestness about opinions and employ yourself about the <lb/>
            things which you wish to acquire; and then lament, if <lb/>
            you do not succeed; for you deserve to lament. But now <lb/>
            you say that you are occupied with other things, that you <lb/>
            are looking after other things; but the many say this <lb/>
            truly, that one act has no community with another.6 He <lb/>
            who has risen in the morning seeks whom (of the house of <lb/>
            Caesar) he shall salute, to whom he shall say something <lb/>
            agreeable, to whom he shall send a present, how he shall <lb/>
            please the dancing man, how by bad behaviour to one he <lb/>
            may please another. When he prays, he prays about <note type="footnote"> 6 Schweig. says that he has not observed that this proverb is men­ <lb/>

            of it, unless it be what he expresses in the Latin version (iv. 10. 24 <lb/>
            'alterum opus cum altero nihil commune habet.' I think that the <lb/>
            context explains it: if you wish to obtain a particular end, employ the <lb/>

            these things; when he sacrifices, he sacrifices for these <lb/>
            things: the saying of Pythagoras <lb/>
            Let sleep not come upon thy languid eyes 7 <lb/>
            he transfers to these things. Where have I failed in the <lb/>
            matters pertaining to flattery ? What have I done ? Any <lb/>
            thing like a free man, any thing like a noble minded man ? <lb/>
            And if he finds any thing of the kind, he blames and accuses <lb/>
            himself: " Why did you say this ? Was it not in your power <lb/>
            to lie ? Even the philosophers say that nothing hinders <lb/>
            us from telling a lie." But do you, if indeed you have <lb/>
            cared about nothing else except the proper use of appear­ <lb/>
            ances, as soon as you have risen in the morning reflect, <lb/>
            " What do I want in order to be free from passion (affects), <lb/>
            and free from perturbation? What aID 1 ? Am I a poor <lb/>
            body, a piece of property, a thing of which something is <lb/>
            said? 1 am none of these. But what am I? I am a <lb/>
            rational animal. What then is required of me?" Reflect <lb/>
            on your acts. Where have I omitted the things which <lb/>
            conduce to happiness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔροιαν</foreign>) ? What have I done which <lb/>
            is either unfriendly or unsocial ? what have I not done as <lb/>
            to these things which I ought to have done ?</p>
          <p>So great then being the difference in desires, actions, <lb/>
            wishes, would you still have the same share with others in <lb/>
            those things about which you have not laboured, and they <lb/>
            have laboured ? Then are you surprised if they pity you, <lb/>
            and are you vexed? But they are not vexed if you pity <lb/>
            them. Why ? Because they are convinced that they have <lb/>
            that which is good, and you are not convinced. For this <lb/>
            reason you are not satisfied with your own, but you desire <lb/>
            that which they have: but they are satisfied with their <lb/>
            own, and do not desire what you have: since if you were <lb/>
            really convinced, that with respect to what is good, it is <lb/>
            you who are the possessor of it and that they have missed <lb/>
            it, you would not even have thought of what they say <lb/>
            about you. <note type="footnote"> 7 See iii. i. note 2. Epictetus is making a parody of the verses of Pytha­ <lb/>

          <p>WHAT makes the tyrant formidable? The guards, you <lb/>
            say, and their swords, and the men of the bedchamber and <lb/>
            those who exclude them who would enter. Why then if <lb/>
            you bring a boy (child) to the tyiant when he is with his <lb/>
            guards, is he not afraid; or is it because the child does <lb/>
            not understand these things? If then any man does <lb/>
            understand what guards are and that they have swords, <lb/>
            and comes to the tyrant for this very purpose because he <lb/>
            wishes to die on account of some circumstance and seeks <lb/>
            to die easily by the hand of another, is he afraid of the <lb/>
            guards ? No, for he wishes for the thing which makes the <lb/>
            guards formidable. If then any man neither wishing to <lb/>
            die nor to live by all means, but only as it may be per­ <lb/>
            mitted, approaches the tyrant, what hinders him from <lb/>
            approaching the tyrant without fear? Nothing. If then <lb/>
            a man has the same opinion about his property as the man <lb/>
            whom I have instanced has about his body ; and also about <lb/>
            his children and his wife and in a word is so affected by <lb/>
            some madness or despair that he cares not whether he <lb/>
            possesses them or not, but like children who are playing <lb/>
            with shells care (quarrel) about the play, but do not trouble <lb/>
            themselves about the shells, so he too has set no value on <lb/>
            the materials (things), but values the pleasure that he has <lb/>
            with them and the occupation, what tyrant is then for­ <lb/>
            midable to him or what guards or what swords ?</p>
          <p>Then through madness is it possible for a man to be so <lb/>
            disposed towards these things, and the Galilaeans through <lb/>
            habit,1 and is it possible that no man can learn from reason <note type="footnote"> 1 See Schweig.'s note on the text. By the Galilaeans it is probable <lb/>
            that Epictetus means the Christians, whose obstinacy Antoninus also <lb/>
            mentions (xi. 3). Epictetus, a contemporary of St. Paul, knew little <lb/>
            about the Christians, and only knew some examples of their obstinate <lb/>
            adherence to the new faith and the fanatical behaviour of some of the <lb/>
            converts. That there were wild fanatics among the early Christians is <lb/>
            proved on undoubted authority; and also that there always have been <lb/>
            such, and now are such. The abuse of any doctrines or religious <lb/>
            opinions is indeed no argument against such doctrines or religious <lb/>
            opinions; and it is a fact quite consistent with experience that the best <lb/>
            things are liable to be perverted, misunderstood, and misused. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            and from demonstration that God has made all the things <lb/>
            in the universe and the universe itself completely free <lb/>
            from hindrance and perfect, and the parts of it for the use <lb/>
            of the whole ? All other animals indeed are incapable of <lb/>
            comprehending the administration of it; but the rational <lb/>
            animal man has faculties for the consideration of all these <lb/>
            things, and for understanding that it is a part, and what <lb/>
            kind of a part it is, and that it is right for the parts to be <lb/>
            subordinate to the whole. And besides this being naturally <lb/>
            noble, magnanimous and free, man sees that of the things <lb/>
            which surround him some are free from hindrance and in <lb/>
            his power, and the other things are subject to hindrance <lb/>
            and in the power of others; that the things which are free <lb/>
            from hindrance are in the power of the will; and those <lb/>
            which are subject to hindrance are the things which are <lb/>
            not in the power of the will. And for this reason if he <lb/>
            thinks that his good and his interest be in these things <lb/>
            only which are free from hindrance and in his own power, <lb/>
            he will be free, prosperous, happy, free from harm, mag­ <lb/>
            nanimous, pious, thankful to God2 for all things; in no <lb/>
            matter finding fault with any of the things which have <lb/>
            not been put in his power, nor blaming any of them.3 <lb/>
            But if he thinks that his good and his interest are in <lb/>
            externals and in things which are not in the power of his <lb/>
            will, he must of necessity be hindered, be impeded, be a <lb/>
            slave to those who have the power over the things which <lb/>
            he admires (desires) and fears; and he must of necessity be <lb/>
            impious because he thinks that he is harmed by God, and <lb/>
            he must be unjust because he always claims more than <lb/>
            belongs to him; and he must of necessity be abject and <lb/>
            mean.</p>
          <p>What hinders a man, who has clearly separated (com­ <lb/>
            prehended) these things, from living with a light heart <lb/>
            and bearing easily the reins, quietly expecting every thing <lb/>
            which can happen, and enduring that which has already <lb/>
            happened ? Would you have me to bear poverty? Come <lb/>
            and you will know what poverty is when it has found one <lb/>
            who can act well the part of a poor man. Would you <note type="footnote"> 2 ' This agrees with Eph. v. 20: " Giving thanks always for all things <lb/>

            have me to possess power ? Let me have power, and also <lb/>
            the trouble of it. Well, banishment ? Wherever I shall go, <lb/>
            there it will be well with me; for here also where I am, it <lb/>
            was not because of the place that it was well with me, but <lb/>
            because of my opinions which I shall carry off with me : <lb/>
            for neither can any man deprive me of them; but my <lb/>
            opinions alone are mine and they cannot be taken from <lb/>
            me, and I am satisfied while I have them, wherever I may <lb/>
            be and whatever I am doing. But now it is time to die. <lb/>
            Why do you say to die ? Make no tragedy show of the <lb/>
            thing, but speak of it as it is: it is now time for the <lb/>
            matter (of the body) to be resolved into the things out of <lb/>
            which it was composed. And what is the formidable <lb/>
            thing here ? what is going to perish of the things which <lb/>
            are in the universe? 4 what new thing or wondrous is <lb/>
            going to happen ? Is it for this reason that a tyrant is <lb/>
            formidable ? Is it for this reason that the guards appear <lb/>
            to have swords which are large and sharp ? Say this to <lb/>
            others; but I have considered about all these things; no <lb/>
            man has power over me. I have been made free; I know <lb/>
            his commands, no man' can now lead me as a slave. I <lb/>
            have a proper person to assert my freedom; 5 I have proper <lb/>
            judges. ( I say) are you not the master of my body? <lb/>
            What then is that to me ? Are you not the master of my <lb/>
            property ? What then is that to me ? Are you not the <lb/>
            master of my exile or of my chains ? Well, from all these <lb/>
            things and all the poor body itself I depart at your <lb/>
            bidding, when you please. Make trial of your power, and <lb/>
            you will know how far it reaches.</p>
          <p>Whom then can I still fear ? Those who are over the <lb/>
            bedchamber? 6 Lest they should do, what? Shut me <lb/>
            out? If they find that I wish to enter, let them shut me <lb/>
            out. Why then do you go to the doors ? Because I think <lb/>
            it befits me, while the play (sport) lasts, to join in it. <lb/>
            How then are you not shut out ? Because unless some <note type="footnote"> 4 He says that the body will be resolved into the things of which it is <lb/>
            composed: nr.ne of them will perish. The soul, as he has said elsewhere, <lb/>

            one allows me to go in, I do not choose to go in, but am <lb/>
            always content with that which happens; for I think that <lb/>
            what God chooses is better than what I choose.7 I will <lb/>
            attach myself as a minister and follower to him; I have <lb/>
            the same movements (pursuits) as he has, I have the same <lb/>
            desires; in a word, I have the same will (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συνθέλω</foreign>). There <lb/>
            is no shutting out for me, but for those who would force <lb/>
            their way in. Why then do not I force my way in? <lb/>
            Because I know that nothing good is distributed within <lb/>
            to those who enter. But when I hear any man called <lb/>
            fortunate because he is honoured by Caesar, I say, what <lb/>
            does he happen to get ? A province (the government of a <lb/>
            province). Does he also obtain an opinion such as he <lb/>
            ought ? The office of a Prefect. Does he also obtain the <lb/>
            power of using his office well ? Why do 1 still strive to <lb/>
            -enter (Caesar's chamber) ? A man scatters dried figs and <lb/>
            nuts: the children seize them, and fight with one another; <lb/>
            men do not, for they think them to be a small matter. <lb/>
            But if a man should throw about shells, even the children <lb/>
            do not seize them. Provinces are distributed: let chil­ <lb/>
            aren look to that. Money is distributed: let children <lb/>
            look to that. Praetorships, consulships are distributed: <lb/>

            Nothing else. And what else a (falling) tile ? Nothing <lb/>

            and worship them, and go about as the slave of all of <lb/>
            them ? I hope that this will not happen: but when I <lb/>
            have once learned that every thing which has come into <lb/>
            existence must also go out of it, that the universe may not <lb/>
            stand still nor be impeded, I no longer consider it any <lb/>
            difference whether a fever shall do it or a tile, or a soldier. <lb/>
            Bnt if a man must make a comparison between these <lb/>
            things, I know that the soldier will do it with less <lb/>
            trouble (to me), and quicker. When then I neither fear <lb/>
            any thing which a tyrant can do to me, nor desire any <lb/>
            thing which he can give, why do I still look on with <lb/>
            wonder (admiration)? Why am I still confounded? <lb/>
            Why do I fear the guards? Why am I pleased if he <lb/>
            speaks to me in a friendly way, and receives me, and <lb/>
            why do I tell others how he spoke to me? Is he a <lb/>
            Socrates, is he a Diogenes that his praise should be a proof <lb/>
            of what I am? Have I been eager to imitate his morals? <lb/>

            long as he does not bid me to do any thing foolish or un­ <lb/>
            reasonable. But if he says to me, Go and bring Leon 8 of <lb/>
            Salamis, I say to him, Seek another, for I am no longer <lb/>
            playing. (The tyrant says): Lead him away (to prison). <lb/>
            I follow; that is part of the play. But your head will <lb/>
            be taken off—Does the tyrant's head always remain where <lb/>
            it is, and the beads of you who obey him ?—But you will <lb/>
            be cast out unburied ?-If the corpse is I, I shall be cast <lb/>

            quickly. Are all things then done well ? By no means: <lb/>
            but the acts which proceed from right opinions are done <lb/>
            well; and those which proceed from bad opinions are done <lb/>
            ill. But do you, until you know the opinion from which <lb/>
            a man does each thing, neither praise nor blame the act. <lb/>
            But the opinion is not easily discovered from the external <lb/>
            things (acts). This man is a carpenter. Why ? Because <lb/>
            he uses an axe. What then is this to the matter ? This <lb/>
            man is a musician because he sings. And what does that <lb/>
            signify? This man is a philosopher. Because he wears a <lb/>
            cloak and long hair. And what does a juggler wear? <lb/>
            For this reason if a man sees any philosopher acting <lb/>
            indecently, immediately he says, See what the philosopher <lb/>
            is doing; but he ought because of the man's indecent <lb/>
            behaviour rather to say that he is not a philosopher. For <lb/>
            if this is the preconceived notion ( <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόληψις</foreign>) of a philosopher <lb/>
            and what he professes, to wear a cloak and long hair, <lb/>
            men would say well; but if what he professes is this <lb/>
            rather, to keep himself free from faults, why do wo not <lb/>
            rather, because he does not make good his professions, <lb/>
            take from him the name of philosopher ? For so we do in <lb/>
            the case of all other arts. When a man sees another <lb/>
            handling an axe badly, he does not say, what is the use <lb/>
            of the carpenter's art? See how badly carpenters do <lb/>
            their work; but he says just the contrary, Thisman is <lb/>
            not a carpenter, for he uses an axe badly. In the same <lb/>
            way if a man hears another singing badly, he does not <lb/>
            say, See how musicians sing; but rather, This man is not <lb/>
            a musician. But it is in the matter of philosophy only <lb/>
            that people do this. When they see a man acting con. <lb/>
            trary to the profession of a philosopher, they do not take <lb/>
            away his title, but they assume him to be a philosopher, <lb/>
            and from his acts deriving the fact that he is behaving <lb/>
            indecently they conclude that there is no use in philo­ <lb/>
            sophy.</p>
          <p>What then is the reason of this ? Because we attach <lb/>
            value to the notion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόληψιν</foreign>) of a carpenter, and to that <lb/>
            of a musician, and to the notion of other artisans in like <lb/>
            manner, but not to that of a philosopher, and we judge <lb/>
            from externals only that it is a thing confused and ill <lb/>
            defined. And what other kind of art has a name from the <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            tress and the hair; and has not both theorems and a <lb/>
            naterial and an end ? What then is the material (matter) <lb/>
            of the philosopher ? Is it a cloak ? No, but reason. What <lb/>
            s his end ? is it to wear a cloak ? No, but to possess the <lb/>
            eason in a right state. Of what kind are his theorems ? <lb/>
            Are they those about the way in which the beard becomes <lb/>
            great or the hair long? No, but rather what Zeno says, <lb/>
            o know the elements of reason, what kind of a thing each <lb/>
            of them is, and how they are fitted to one another, and <lb/>
            vhat things are consequent upon them. Will you not <lb/>
            hen see first if he does what he professes when he acts <lb/>
            n an unbecoming manner, and then blame his study <lb/>
            pursuit) ? But now when you yourself are acting in a <lb/>
            ober way, you say in consequence of what he seems to <lb/>
            ou to be doing wrong, Look at the philosopher, as if it <lb/>
            vere proper to call by the name of philosopher one who <lb/>
            loes these things; and further, This is the conduct of a <lb/>
            philosopher. But you do not say, Look at the carpenter, <lb/>
            vhen you know that a carpenter is an adulterer or you <lb/>
            ee him to be a glutton; nor do you say, See the musician. <lb/>
            Chus to a certain degree even you perceive (understand) <lb/>
            he profession of a philosopher, but you fall away from the <lb/>
            lotion, and you are confused through want of care.</p>
          <p>But even the philosophers themselves as they are <lb/>
            ailed pursue the thing (philosophy) by beginning with <lb/>
            hings which are common to them and others: as soon as <lb/>
            hey have assumed a cloak and grown a beard, they say, <lb/>
            am a philosopher.2 But no man will say, I am a <lb/>
            Musician, if he has bought a plectrum (fiddlestick) and <lb/>
            , lute: nor will he say, I am a smith, if he has put on <lb/>
            cap and apron. But the dress is fitted to the art; and <lb/>
            hey take their name from the art, and not from the <lb/>
            ress. For this reason Euphrates 3 used to say well, A <lb/>

            for the sake of the spectators, but for the sake of myself: <lb/>

            Then, as 1 struggled alone, so I alone also was in danger: <lb/>
            in no respect through mo, if I did anything base or unbe­ <lb/>
            coming, was philosophy endangered; nor did I injure the <lb/>
            many by doing any thing wrong as a philosopher. For <lb/>
            this reason those who did not know my purpose used to <lb/>
            wonder how it was that while I conversed and lived <lb/>
            altogether with all philosophers, I was not a philosopher <lb/>
            myself. And what was the harm for me to be known to <lb/>
            be a philosopher by my acts and not by outward marks ?4 <lb/>
            See how I eat, how I drink, how I sleep, how I bear and <lb/>
            forbear, how I co-operate, how I employ desire, how I <lb/>
            employ aversion (turning from things), how I maintain <lb/>
            the relations ( to things) those which are natural or those <lb/>
            which are acquired, how free from confusion, how free <lb/>

            his head, what is the harm in not being recognized by so <lb/>
            foolish a judge ?</p>
          <p>So Socrates was not known to be a philosopher by most <lb/>
            persons; and they used to come to him and ask to be in­ <lb/>
            troduced to philosophers. Was he vexed then as we are, <lb/>
            and did he say, And do you not think that I am a philo­ <lb/>
            sopher? No, but he would take them and introduce them, <lb/>
            being satisfied with one thing, with being a philosopher; <lb/>
            and being pleased also with not being thought to be a <lb/>
            philosopher, he was not annoyed: for he thought of his <lb/>
            own occupation. What is the work of an honourable and <lb/>
            good man ? To have many pupils ? By no means. They <lb/>
            will look to this matter who are earnest about it. But <lb/>
            was it his business to examine carefully difficult theorems ? <lb/>

            say, I am free from passions and disturbance: do not <lb/>
            be ignorant, my friends, that while you are uneasy and <lb/>
            disturbed about things of no value, I alone am free from <lb/>
            all perturbation. So is it not enough for you to feel no <lb/>
            pain, unless you make this proclamation: Come together <lb/>
            all who are suffering gout, pains in the head, fever, ye <lb/>
            who are lame, blind, and observe that I am sound (free) <lb/>

            immediately free from disease, and unless you show your <lb/>
            own health as an example.</p>
          <p>For such is the Cynic who is honoured with the sceptre <lb/>
            and the diadem by Zeus, and says, That you may see, <lb/>
            0 men, that you seek happiness and tranquillity not where <lb/>
            it is, but where it is not, behold I am sent to you by God <lb/>

            Is not decent behaviour lost ? is it that he who has lost <lb/>
            these things has sustained no loss ? Perhaps you think <lb/>
            that not one of these things is a loss. But there was a <lb/>
            time when you reckoned this the only loss and damage, <lb/>
            and you were anxious that no man should disturb you <lb/>
            from these (good) words and actions.</p>
          <p>Observe, you are disturbed from these good words and <lb/>
            actions by nobody, but by yourself. Fight with yourself, <lb/>
            restore yourself to decency, to modesty, to liberty. If any <lb/>

            fume myself with oils, would you not have gone and with <lb/>
            your own hand have killed the man who thus calumniated <lb/>
            me? Now will you not help yourself? and how much <lb/>
            easier is this help ? There is no need to kill any man, <lb/>
            nor to put him in chains, nor to treat him with contumely <lb/>
            nor to enter the Forum (go to the courts of law), but it is <lb/>
            only necessary for you to speak to yourself who will be <lb/>
            most easily persuaded, with whom no man has more power <lb/>
            of persuasion than yourself. First of all, condemn what <lb/>
            you are doing, and then when you have condemned it, do <lb/>
            not despair of yourself, and be not in the condition of <lb/>
            those men of mean spirit, who, when they have once <lb/>
            given in, surrender themselves completely and are carried <lb/>
            away as if by a torrent. But see what the trainers of boys <lb/>
            do. Has the boy fallen ? Rise, they say, wrestle again <lb/>

            the same kind: for be well assured that nothing is more <lb/>
            tractable than the human soul. You must exercise the <lb/>
            Will,4 and the thing is done, it is set right: as on the <lb/>

          <p>THE difficulties of all men are about external things, their <lb/>
            helplessness is about externals. What shall I do, how <lb/>
            will it be, how will it turn out, will this happen, will <lb/>
            that ? All these are the words of those who are turning <lb/>
            themselves to things which are not within the power of <lb/>
            the will. For who says, How shall I not assent to that <lb/>
            which is false ? how shall I not turn away from the <lb/>
            truth ? If a man be of such a good disposition as to be <lb/>
            anxious about these things, I will remind him of this, <lb/>
            Why are you anxious ? The thing is in your own power : <lb/>
            be assured: do not be precipitate in assenting before you <lb/>
            apply the natural rule. On the other side, if a man is <lb/>
            anxious (uneasy) about desire, lest it fail in its purpose <lb/>
            and miss its end, and with respect to the avoidance of <lb/>
            things, lest he should fall into that which he would <lb/>
            avoid, I will first kiss (love) him, because he throws away <lb/>

            power of) others, nor try to avoid any of the things which <lb/>
            are not in your power. If you do not observe this rule, <lb/>
            you must of necessity fail in your desires and fall into <lb/>
            that which you would avoid. What is the difficulty here ? <lb/>
            where is there room for the words, How will it be ? and <lb/>
            How will it turn out ? and will this happen or that ?</p>
          <p>Now is not that which will happen independent of <lb/>
            the will? Yes. And the nature of good and of evil is it <lb/>
            not in the things which are within the power of the will? <lb/>
            Yes. Is it in your power then to treat according to <lb/>
            nature every thing which happens? Can any person <lb/>
            hinder you? No man. No longer then say to me, How <lb/>
            will it be ? For however it may be, you will dispose of <lb/>
            it well,1 and the result to you will be a fortunate one. <lb/>
            What would Hercules have been if he said, How shall a <lb/>
            great lion not appear to me, or a great boar, or savage <lb/>

            appear, you will fight a greater fight: if bad men appear, <lb/>
            you will relieve the earth of the bad. Suppose then that <lb/>
            I lose my life in this way. You will die a good man, <lb/>
            doing a noble act. For since we must certainly die, of <lb/>

            trading, or serving in a consulship or suffering from <lb/>
            indigestion or from diarrhoea. What then do you wish <lb/>
            to be doing when you are found by death? I for my <lb/>

            belongs to a man, beneficent, suitable to the general <lb/>
            interest, noble. But if I cannot be found doing things <lb/>

            these things, it is enough for me if I can stretch out my <lb/>

            ever blamed thee? have I been discontented with any <lb/>
            thing that happens, or wished it to be otherwise? have <lb/>
            I wished to transgress the (established) relations (of <lb/>
            things) ? That thou hast given me life, I thank thee <lb/>

            things which are thine I am content; take them back <lb/>

            be made), a man must receive (bear) no small things, nor <lb/>
            are the things small which he must lose (go without). <lb/>
            You cannot both wish to be a consul and to have these <lb/>
            things (the power of making such a dying speech), and to <lb/>
            be eager to have lands, and these things also; and to be <lb/>
            solicitous about slaves and about yourself. But if you <lb/>
            wish for any thing which belongs to another, that which <lb/>
            is your own is lost. This is the nature of the thing: <lb/>
            nothing is given or had for nothing.5 And where is the <lb/>
            wonder? If you wish to be a consul, you must keep <lb/>
            awake, run about, kiss hands, waste yourself with ex­ <lb/>
            haustion at other men's doors, say and do many things <lb/>
            unworthy of a free man, send gifts to many, daily <lb/>
            presents to some. And what is the thing that is got? <lb/>
            Twelve bundles of rods (the consular fasces), to sit three <lb/>
            or four times on the tribunal, to exhibit the games in the <lb/>
            Circus and to give suppers in small baskets.6 Or, if you <note type="footnote"> dying speech may even be stronger in the sense in which Mrs. Carter <lb/>
            understands it, in my translation, where I have rendered one passage <lb/>
            in the text by the words ‘ I have not dishonoured thee by my acts,' <lb/>
            which she translates, ‘ as far as in me lay, I have not dishonoured <lb/>
            thee;' which apparently means,‘ as far as I could, I have not dis­ <lb/>
            honoured thee.' The Latin translation ‘ quantum in me fuit,' seems <lb/>
            rather ambiguous to me. </note><note type="footnote"> There is a general confession of sins in the prayer book of the <lb/>
            Church of England, part of which Epictetus would not have rejected, <lb/>
            I think. Of course the words which form the peculiar Christian cha­ <lb/>
            racter of the confession would have been unintelligible to him. It is <lb/>
            a confession which all persons of all conditions are supposed to make. <lb/>
            If all persons made the confession with sincerity, it ought to produce <lb/>
            a corresponding behaviour and make men more ready to be kind to one <lb/>
            another, for all who use it confess that they fail in their duty, and it <lb/>
            ought to lower pride and banish arrogance from the behaviour of those <lb/>
            who in wealth and condition are elevated above the multitude. But I <lb/>
            have seen it somewhere said, I cannot remember where, but said in no <lb/>
            friendly spirit to Christian prayer, that some men both priests and <lb/>

            do not agree about this, let some one show me what there <lb/>
            is besides these things. In order then to secure freedom <lb/>
            from passions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άπαθείας</foreign>), tranquillity, to sleep well when <lb/>
            you do sleep, to be really awake when you are awake, to <lb/>
            fear nothing, to be anxious about nothing, will you spend <lb/>
            nothing and give no labour ? But if any thing belonging <lb/>
            to you be lost while you are thus busied, or be wasted <lb/>
            badly, or another obtains what you ought to have <lb/>
            obtained, will you immediately be vexed at what has <lb/>
            happened? Will you not take into the account on the <lb/>
            other side what you receive and for what, how much for <lb/>
            how much ? Do you expect to have for nothing things so <lb/>
            great? And how can you? One work (thing) has no <lb/>
            community with another. You cannot have both external <lb/>
            things after bestowing care on them and your own ruling <lb/>
            faculty:7 but if you would have those, give up this. If <lb/>
            you do not, you will have neither this nor that, while you <lb/>
            are drawn in different ways to both.8 The oil will be <lb/>
            spilled, the household vessels will perish: (that may be), <lb/>
            but I shall be free from passions (tranquil).—There will <lb/>
            be a fire when I am not present, and the books will be <lb/>
            destroyed: but I shall treat appearances according to <lb/>
            nature-Well; but I shall have nothing to eat. If I am <lb/>
            so unlucky, death is a harbour; and death is the harbour <lb/>
            for all; this is the place of refuge; and for this reason <lb/>
            not one of the things in life is difficult: as soon as you <lb/>
            choose, you are out of the house, and are smoked no more.9 <lb/>
            Why then are you anxious, why do you lose your sleep, <lb/>
            why do you not straightway, after considering wherein <lb/>
            your good is and your evil, say, Both of them are in my <lb/>
            power? Neither can any man deprive me of the good, <lb/>
            nor involve me in the bad against my will. Why do I <lb/>
            not throw myself down and snore ? for all that I have is <lb/>
            safe. As to the things which belong to others, he will <lb/>
            look to them who gets them, as they may be given by <lb/>
            him who has the power.10 Who am I who wish to have <note type="footnote"> 7 “ You cannot serve God and Mammon." Matthew vi. 24. Mrs. <lb/>

            or Menelaus?11 For when did he suppose that any of his <lb/>

            eyes that on the morrow or the day after he or his friend <lb/>

            pipkin.' Achilles laments that he has lost the services of his friend at <lb/>
            table, a vulgar kind of complaint: he is thinking of his own loss, <lb/>
            instead of his friend. The answer is such a loss as he laments is easily <lb/>
            repaired: the loss of such a friend is as easily repaired as the loss of a <lb/>
            cooking vessel. Mrs. Carter in her zeal to contrast the teaching of the <lb/>
            Apostle with that of Epictetus seems to forget for the time that Epictetus, <lb/>
            so far as we know, did not accept or did not teach the doctrine of a <lb/>
            future life. As to what he thought of friendship, if it was a real <lb/>
            friendship, such as we can conceive, I am sure that he did not think of <lb/>
            it, as Urs. Carter says that he did; for true friendship implies many of <lb/>
            the virtues which Epictetus taught and practised. He has a chapter <lb/>
            on Friendship, ii. 22, which I suppose that Mrs. Carter did not think <lb/>

            <title type="sub">ABOUT PURITY (CLEANLINESS).</title>
          </ab>
          <p>SOME persons raise a question whether the social feeling <lb/>
            is contained in the nature of man; and yet I think that <lb/>
            these same persons would have no doubt that love of <lb/>
            purity is certainly contained in it, and that if man is <lb/>
            distinguished from other animals by any thing, he is dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished by this. When then we see any other animal <lb/>
            cleaning itself, we are accustomed to speak of the act <lb/>
            with surprise, and to add that the animal is acting like a <lb/>
            man: and on the other hand, if a man blames an animal <lb/>
            for being dirty, straightway as if we were making an <lb/>
            excuse for it, we say that of course the animal is not a <lb/>
            human creature. So we suppose that there is something <lb/>
            superior in man, and that we first receive it from the <lb/>
            Gods. For since the Gods by their nature are pure and <lb/>
            free from corruption, so far as men approach them by <lb/>
            reason, so far do they cling to purity and to a love (habit) <note type="footnote"> 1 The word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ κοινωνικον</foreign>. Compare i. 23,1, if. 10, 14, ii. 20, a. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            of purity. But since it is impossible that man's nature <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὺσία</foreign>) can be altogether pure being mixed (composed) of <lb/>
            such materials, reason is applied, as far as it is possible, <lb/>
            and reason endeavours to make human nature love <lb/>
            purity.2</p>
          <p>The first then and highest purity is that which is in the <lb/>
            soul; and we say the same of impurity. Now you could <lb/>
            not discover the impurity of the soul as you could dis­ <lb/>
            cover that of the body: but as to the soul, what else <lb/>
            could you find in it than that which makes it filthy in <lb/>
            respect to the acts which are her own ? Now the acts of <lb/>
            the soul are movement towards an object or movement <lb/>
            from it, desire, aversion, preparation, design (purpose), <lb/>
            assent. What then is it which in these acts makes the <lb/>
            soul filthy and impure ? Nothing else than her own bad <lb/>
            judgments (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κρίματα</foreign>). Consequently the impurity of the <lb/>
            soul is the soul's bad opinions ; and the purification of the <lb/>
            soul is the planting in it of proper opinions; and the <lb/>
            soul is pure which has proper opinions, for the soul <lb/>
            alone in her own acts is free from perturbation and <lb/>
            pollution.</p>
          <p>Now we ought to work at something like this in the <lb/>
            body also, as far as we can. It was impossible for the <lb/>
            defluxions of the nose not to run when man has such a <lb/>
            mixture in his body. For this reason nature has made <lb/>
            hands and the nostrils themselves as channels for carrying <lb/>
            off the humours. If then a man sucks up the defluxions, <lb/>
            I say that he is not doing the act of a man. It was im­ <lb/>
            possible for a man's feet not to be made muddy and not <lb/>
            be soiled at all when he passes through dirty places. For <lb/>
            this reason nature (God) has made water and hands. It <lb/>
            was impossible that some impurity should not remain in <lb/>
            the teeth from eating: for this reason, she says, wash the <lb/>
            teeth. Why ? In order that you may be a man and not <lb/>
            a wild beast or a hog. It was impossible that from the <lb/>
            sweat and the pressing of the clothes there should not <lb/>
            remain some impurity about the body which requires to <lb/>
            be cleaned away. For this reason water, oil, hands, <note type="footnote"> 2 In the text there are two words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθαρός</foreign> which means ‘ pure: and <lb/>

            towels, scrapers (strigils),3 nitre, sometimes all other kinds <lb/>
            of means are necessary for cleaning the body. You do <lb/>
            not act so: but the smith will take off the rust from the <lb/>
            iron (instruments), and he will have tools prepared for <lb/>
            this purpose, and you yourself wash the platter when you <lb/>
            are going to eat, if you are not completely impure and <lb/>
            dirty: but will you not wash the body nor make it clean ? <lb/>
            Why ? he replies. I will tell you again; in the first place, <lb/>
            that you may do the acts of a man; then, that you may <lb/>
            not be disagreeable to those with whom you associate. <lb/>
            You do something of this kind even 4 in this matter, and <lb/>
            you do not perceive it: you think that you deserve to <lb/>
            stink. Let it be so: deseive to stink. Do you think <lb/>
            that also those who sit by you, those who recline at table <lb/>
            with you, that those who kiss you deserve the same? 5 <lb/>
            Either go into a desert, where you deserve to go, or live <lb/>
            by yourself, and smell yourself. For it is just that you <lb/>
            alone should enjoy your own impurity. But when you <lb/>
            are in a city, to behave so inconsiderately and foolishly, <lb/>
            to what character do you think that it belongs? If <lb/>
            nature had entrusted to you a horse, would you have over­ <lb/>
            looked and neglected him ? And now think that you have <lb/>
            been entrusted with your own body as with a horse; <lb/>
            wash it, wipe it, take care that no man turns away from <lb/>
            it, that no one gets out of the way for it. But who does <lb/>
            not get out of the way of a dirty man, of a stinking man, <lb/>
            of a man whose skin is foul, more than he does out of the <lb/>

          <p>But Socrates washed himself seldom—Yes, but his body <lb/>
            was clean and fair: and it was so agreeable and sweet <lb/>
            that the most beautiful and the most noble loved him, and <lb/>
            desired to sit by hiin rather than by the side of those who <lb/>
            had the handsomest forms. It was in his power neither to <lb/>
            use the bath nor to wash himself, if he chose; and yet the <lb/>
            rare use of water had an effect. [If you do not choose to <lb/>
            wash with warm water, wash with cold.6] But Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes says <lb/>
            Those who are pale, unshod, 'tis those I mean. <lb/>
            (Nubes v. 102.) <lb/>
            For Aristophanes says of Socrates that he also walked the <lb/>
            air and stole clothes from the palaestra.7 But all who <lb/>
            have written about Socrates bear exactly the contrary <lb/>
            evidence in his favour; they say that he was pleasant not <lb/>
            only to hear, but also to see.8 On the other hand they <lb/>
            write the same about Diogenes.9 For we ought not even <lb/>
            by the appearance of the body to deter the multitude from <lb/>
            philosophy; but as in other things, a philosopher should <lb/>
            show himself cheerful and tranquil, so also he should in <lb/>
            the things that relate to the body: See, ye men, that I <lb/>
            have nothing, that I want nothing: see how I am without <lb/>
            a house, and without a city, and an exile, if it happens to <lb/>
            be so,10 and without a hearth I live more free from <lb/>
            trouble and more happily than all of noble birth and than <lb/>
            the rich. But look at my poor body also and observe that <lb/>
            it is not injured by my hard way of living-But if a man <lb/>
            says this to me, who has the appearance (dress) and face <lb/>
            of a condemned man, what God shall persuade me to <lb/>

            were going to become a wise man. I indeed would rather <lb/>
            that a young man, who is making his first movements <lb/>
            towards philosophy, should come to me with his hair <lb/>
            carefully trimmed than with it dirty and rough, for <lb/>
            there is seen in him a certain notion (appearance) of <lb/>
            beauty and a desire of (attempt at) that which is be­ <lb/>
            coming ; and where he supposes it to be, there also he <lb/>
            strives that it shall be. It is only necessary to show him <lb/>
            (what it is), and to say: Young man, you seek beauty, <lb/>
            and you do well: you must know then that it (is pro­ <lb/>
            duced) grows in that part of you where you have the <lb/>
            rational faculty: seek it there where you have the move­ <lb/>
            ments towards and the movements from things, where <lb/>
            you have the desires towards, and the aversion from things: <lb/>
            for this is what you have in yourself of a superior kind; <lb/>
            but the poor body is naturally only earth: why do you <lb/>
            labour about it to no purpose ? if you shall learn nothing <lb/>
            else, you will learn from time that the body is nothing. <lb/>
            But if a man comes to me daubed with filth, dirty, with a <lb/>
            moustache down to his knees, what can I say to him, by <lb/>
            what kind of resemblance can I lead him on ? For about <lb/>
            what has he busied himself which resembles beauty, that <lb/>
            I may be able to change him and say, Beauty is not in <lb/>
            this, but in that? Would you have me to tell him, that <lb/>
            beauty consists not in being daubed with muck, but that <lb/>
            it lies in the rational part ? Has he any desire of beauty ? <lb/>
            has he any form of it in his mind ? Go and talk to a hog, <lb/>
            and tell him not to roll in the mud.</p>
          <p>For this reason the words of Xenocrates touched Pole­ <lb/>
            mon also, since he was a lover of beauty, for he entered <lb/>
            (the room) having in him certain incitements (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έναύσματα</foreign>) <lb/>
            to love of beauty, but he looked for it in the wrong <lb/>
            placed For nature has not made even the animals dirty <lb/>
            which live with man. Does a horse ever wallow in the <lb/>
            mud, or a well bred dog? But the hog, and the dirty <lb/>
            geese, and worms and spiders do, which are banished <lb/>
            furthest from human intercourse. Do you then being a <lb/>
            man choose to be not as one of the animals which <lb/>
            live with man, but rather a worm, or a spider? Will <note type="footnote"> 12 As to Polemon see iii. c. 1,14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="371"/>
            you not wash yourself somewhere some time in such <lb/>
            manner as you choose?13 Will you not wash off the dirt <lb/>
            from your body ? Will you not come clean that those <lb/>
            with whom you keep company may have pleasure in <lb/>
            being with you ? But do you go with us even into the <lb/>
            temples in such a state, where it is not permitted to spit <lb/>
            or blow the nose, being a heap of spittle and of snot ?</p>
          <p>What then? does any man (that is, do I) require you <lb/>
            to ornament yourself? Far from it; except to ornament <lb/>
            that which we really are by nature, the rational faculty, <lb/>
            the opinions, the actions; but as to the body only so far as <lb/>
            purity, only so far as not to give offence. But if you are <lb/>
            told that you ought not to wear garments dyed with <lb/>
            purple, go and daub your cloak with muck or tear it.14 <lb/>
            But how shall I have a neat cloak? Man, you have <lb/>
            water; wash it. Here is a youth worthy of being loved,15 <lb/>
            here is an old man worthy of loving and being loved in <lb/>
            return, a fit person for a man to intrust to him a son's <lb/>
            instruction, to whom daughters and young men shall come, <lb/>
            if opportunity shall so happen, that the teacher shall <lb/>
            deliver his lessons to them on a dunghill.16 Let this not <lb/>
            be so: every deviation comes from something which is in <lb/>
            man's nature; but this (deviation) is near being some­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">ON ATTENTION</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHEN you have remitted your attention for a short time, <lb/>
            do not imagine this, that you will recover it when you <lb/>
            choose; but let this thought be present to you, that in <lb/>
            consequence of the fault committed to-day your affairs <lb/>
            must be in a worse condition for all that follows. For <lb/>
            first, and what causes most trouble, a habit of not attend­ <lb/>
            ing is formed in you; then a habit of deferring your <lb/>
            attention. And continually from time to time you drive <lb/>
            away by deferring it the happiness of life, proper be­ <lb/>
            haviour, the being and living conformably to nature.1 <lb/>
            If then the procrastination of attention is profitable, the <lb/>
            complete omission of attention is more profitable; but if <lb/>
            it is not profitable, why do you not maintain your atten­ <lb/>
            tion constant?—To-day I choose to play-Well then, <lb/>
            ought you not to play with attention?—I choose to <lb/>
            sing—What then hinders you from doing so with atten­ <lb/>
            tion? Is there any part of life excepted, to which <lb/>
            attention does not extend? For will you do it (any <lb/>
            thing in life) worse by using attention, and better by not <lb/>
            attending at all? And what else of the things in life <lb/>
            is done better by those who do not use attention ? Does <lb/>
            he who works in wood work better by not attending to <lb/>
            it? Does the captain of a ship manage it better by not <lb/>
            attending ? and is any of the smaller acts done better by <lb/>
            inattention ? Do you not see that when you have let your <lb/>
            mind loose, it is no longer in your power to recall it, <lb/>
            either to propriety, or to modesty, or to moderation: but <lb/>
            you do every thing that comes into your mind in obedi­ <lb/>
            ence to your inclinations.</p>
          <p>To what things then ought I to attend ? First to those <lb/>
            general (principles) and to have them in readiness, and <lb/>
            without them not to sleep, not to rise, not to drink, not to <note type="footnote"> 1 See Schweig.'s note on the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὶώθει ύπερτιθέμενον</foreign>, in place of <lb/>
            which he proposes <foreign xml:lang="grc">έξωθῇ ύπερτιθέμενος</foreign>. Compare Persius, Snt. v. 66. <lb/>

            eat, not to converse (associate) with men; that no man is <lb/>
            master of another man's will, but that in the will alone is <lb/>
            the good and the bad. No man then has the power either <lb/>
            to procure for me any good or to involve me in any evil, <lb/>
            but I alone myself over myself have power in these <lb/>
            things. When then these things are secured to me, why <lb/>
            need I be disturbed about external things ? What tyrant <lb/>
            is formidable, what disease, what poverty, what offence <lb/>
            (from any man)? Well, 1 have not pleased a certain <lb/>
            person. Is he then (the pleasing of him) my work, my <lb/>
            judgment? No. Why then should I trouble myself <lb/>
            about him?—But he is supposed to be some one (of <lb/>
            importance)—He will look to that himself; and those <lb/>
            who think so will also. But I have one whom I ought to <lb/>
            please, to whom I ought to subject myself, whom I ought <lb/>
            to obey, God and those who are next to him.2 He has <lb/>
            placed me with myself, and has put my will in obedience <lb/>
            to myself alone, and has given me rules for the right use <lb/>
            of it; and when I follow these rules in syllogisms, I do <lb/>
            not care for any man who says any thing else (different): <lb/>
            in sophistical argument, I care for no man. Why then <lb/>
            in greater matters do those annoy me who blame me? <lb/>
            What is the cause of this perturbation? Nothing else <lb/>
            than because in this matter (topic) I am not disciplined. <lb/>
            For all knowledge (science) despises ignorance and the <lb/>
            ignorant; and not only the sciences, but even the arts. <lb/>
            Produce any shoemaker that you please, and he ridicules <lb/>
            the many in respect to his own work3 (business). Pro­ <lb/>
            duce any carpenter.</p>
          <p>First then we ought to have these (rules) in readiness, <lb/>
            and to do nothing without them, and we ought to keep <lb/>
            the soul directed to this mark, to pursue nothing external, <lb/>
            and nothing which belongs to others (or is in the power <lb/>
            of others), but to do as he has appointed who has the <note type="footnote"> 2 Compare iv. 4, 39, i. 14, 12; and Encheirid. c. 32, and the remark <lb/>

            power; we ought to pursue altogether the things which <lb/>
            are in the power of the will, and all other things as it is <lb/>
            permitted. Next to this we ought to remember who we <lb/>
            are,4 and what is our name, and to endeavour to direct our <lb/>
            duties towards the character (nature) of our several rela­ <lb/>
            tions (in life) in this manner: what is the season for <lb/>
            singing, what is the season for play, and in whose <lb/>
            presence; what will be the consequence of the act;5 <lb/>
            whether our associates will despite us, whether we shall <lb/>
            despise them;6 when to jeer (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σκῶψαι</foreign>), and whom to <lb/>
            ridicule; and on what occasion to comply and with <lb/>
            whom; and finally, in complying how to maintain our <lb/>
            own character.7 But wherever you have deviated from <lb/>
            any of these rules, there is damage immediately, not from <lb/>
            any thing external, but from the action itself.</p>
          <p>What then? is it possible to be free from faults, (if you <lb/>
            do all this)? It is not possible; but this is possible, <lb/>
            to direct your efforts incessantly to being faultless. For <lb/>
            we must be content if by never remitting this attention <lb/>
            we shall escape at least a few errors. But now when you <lb/>
            have said, To-morrow I will begin to attend, you must be <lb/>
            told that you are saying this, To-day I will be shameless, <lb/>
            disregardful of time and place, mean; it will be in the <lb/>
            power of others to give me pain; to-day I will be <lb/>
            passionate, and envious. See how many evil things yon <lb/>
            are permitting yourself to do. If it is good to use atten­ <lb/>
            tion to-morrow, how much better is it to do so to-day ? if <lb/>
            to-morrow it is in your interest to attend, much more is <lb/>
            it to-day, that you may be able to do so to-morrow also, <lb/>
            and may not defer it again to the third day.8 <note type="footnote"> 4 ‘ Quid sumus, aut quidnam victuri gignimur.' Persius, Sat. iii. 67. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Schweig. thinks that the text will be better translated according <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WHEN a man has seemed to us to have talked with simplicity <lb/>
            (candour) about his own affairs, how is it that at last we <lb/>
            are ourselves also induced to discover to him1 our own <lb/>
            secrets and we think this to be candid behaviour ? In the <lb/>
            first place because it seems unfair for a man to have <lb/>
            listened to the affairs of his neighbour, and not to com­ <lb/>
            municate to him also in turn our own affairs: next, <lb/>
            because we think that we shall not present to them the <lb/>
            appearance of candid men when we are silent about our <lb/>
            own affairs. Indeed men are often accustomed to say, <lb/>
            I have told you all my affairs, will you tell me nothing <lb/>
            of your own? where is this done ?-Besides, we have also <lb/>
            this opinion that we can safely trust him who has already <lb/>
            told us his own affairs; for the notion rises in our mind <lb/>
            that this man could never divulge our affairs because he <lb/>
            would be cautious that we also should not divulge his. In <lb/>
            this way also the incautious are caught by the soldiers at <lb/>
            Rome. A soldier sits by you in a common dress and <lb/>
            begins to speak ill of Caesar; then you, as if you had <lb/>
            received a pledge of his fidelity by his having begun the <lb/>
            abuse, utter yourself also what you think, and then you <lb/>
            are carried off in chains.2</p>
          <p>Something of this kind happens to us also generally. <lb/>
            Now as this man has confidently intrusted his affairs to <lb/>
            me, shall I also do so to any man whom I meet ? (No), <note type="footnote"> 1 Schweig. writes <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῶς ποτε</foreign>, etc., and translates ‘ excitamur quodam­ <lb/>

            soldiers named Frumentarii for the purpose of discovering what was <lb/>
            said and done in private houses. John the Baptist (Luke iii. 14) in <lb/>

            for when I have heard, I keep silence, if I am of such a dis­ <lb/>
            position; but he goes forth and tells all men what he has <lb/>
            heard. Then if I hear what has been done, if I be a man <lb/>
            like him, I resolve to be revenged, I divulge what he has <lb/>
            told me; I both disturb others and am disturbed myself. <lb/>
            But if I remember that one man does not injure another, <lb/>
            and that every man's acts injure and profit him, I secure <lb/>
            this, that I do not any thing like him, but still I suffer <lb/>
            what I do suffer through my own silly talk.</p>
          <p>True: but it is unfair when you have heard the secrets <lb/>
            of your neighbour for you in your turn to communicate <lb/>
            nothing to him.—Did I ask you for your secrets, my man ? <lb/>
            did you communicate your affairs on certain terms, that <lb/>
            you should in return hear mine also ? If you are a babbler <lb/>
            and think that all who meet you are friends, do you wish <lb/>
            me also to be like you? But why, if you did well in <lb/>
            intrusting your affairs to me, and it is not well for me to <lb/>
            intrust mine to you, do you wish me to be so rash? It is <lb/>
            just the same as if I had a cask which is water-tight, and <lb/>
            you one with a hole in it, and you should come and, <lb/>
            deposit with me your wine that I might put it into my <lb/>
            cask, and then should complain that I also did not intrust <lb/>
            my wine to you, for you have a cask with a hole in it. <lb/>
            How then is there any equality here? You intrusted <lb/>
            your affairs to a man who is faithful, and modest, to a <lb/>
            man who thinks that his own actions alone are injurious <lb/>
            and (or) useful, and that nothing external is. Would you <lb/>
            have me intrust mine to you, a man who has dishonoured <lb/>
            his own faculty of will, and who wishes to gain some <lb/>
            small bit of money or some office or promotion in the <lb/>
            court (emperor's palace), even if you should be going to <lb/>
            murder your own children, like Medea ? Where (in what) <lb/>
            is this equality (fairness)? But show yourself to me to <lb/>
            be faithful, modest, and steady: show me that you have <lb/>
            friendly opinions; show that your cask has no hole in it; <lb/>
            and you will see how I shall not wait for you to trust me <lb/>
            with your affairs, but I myself shall come to you and ask <lb/>
            vou to hear mine. For who does not choose to make use <lb/>
            of a good vessel? Who does not value a benevolent and <lb/>
            faithful adviser? who will not willingly receive a man <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            who is ready to bear a share, as we may say, of the diffi­ <lb/>
            culty of his circumstances, and by this very act to ease the <lb/>
            burden, by taking a part of it.</p>
          <p>True: but I trust you; you do not trust me.—In the <lb/>
            first place, not even do you trust me, but you are a <lb/>
            babbler, and for this reason you cannot hold any thing; <lb/>
            for indeed, if it is true that you trust me, trust your <lb/>
            affairs to me only; but now whenever you see a man at <lb/>
            leisure, you seat yourself by him and say: Brother, I <lb/>
            have no friend more benevolent than you nor dearer; I <lb/>
            request you to listen to my affairs. And you do this even <lb/>
            to those who are not known to you at all. But if you <lb/>
            really trust me, it is plain that you trust me because I am <lb/>
            faithful and modest, not because I have told my affairs to <lb/>
            you. Allow me then to have the same opinion about you. <lb/>
            Show me that if one man tells his affairs to another, he <lb/>
            who tells them is faithful and modest. For if this were <lb/>
            so, I would go about and tell my affairs to every man, if <lb/>
            that would make me faithful and modest. But the thing <lb/>
            is not so, and it requires no common opinions (principles). <lb/>
            If then you see a man who is busy about things not de­ <lb/>
            pendent on his will and subjecting his will to them, you <lb/>
            must know that this man has ten thousand persons to <lb/>
            compel and hinder him. He has no need of pitch or the <lb/>
            wheel to compel him to declare what he knows:3 but a <lb/>
            little girl's nod, if it should so happen, will move him, the <lb/>
            blandishment of one who belongs to Caesar's court, desire <lb/>
            of a magistracy or of an inheritance, and things without <lb/>
            end of that sort. You must remember then among general <lb/>
            principles that secret discourses (discourses about secret <lb/>
            matters) require fidelity and corresponding opinions. But <lb/>
            where can we now find these easily? Or if you cannot <lb/>
            answer that question, let some one point out to me a man <lb/>
            who can say: I care only about the things which are my <lb/>
            own, the things which are not subject to hindrance, the <lb/>
            things which are by nature free. This I hold to be the <lb/>
            nature of the good: but let all other things be as they are <lb/>
            allowed; I do not concern myself. <note type="footnote"> 8 The wheel and pitch were instruments of torture to extract con­ <lb/>

          <p>OF things some are in our power, and others are not. <lb/>
            In our power are opinion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπόληψις</foreign>), movement towards a <lb/>
            thing (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρμή</foreign>), desire, aversion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έκκλισις</foreign>, turning from a <lb/>
            thing); and in a word, whatever are our own acts: not <lb/>
            in our power are the body, property, reputation, offices <lb/>
            (magisterial power), and in a word, whatever are not our <lb/>
            own acts. And the things in our power are by nature <lb/>
            free, not subject to restraint nor hindrance: but the <lb/>
            things not in our power are weak, slavish, subject to <lb/>
            restraint, in the power of others. Remember then that if <lb/>
            you think the things which are by nature slavish to be <lb/>
            free, and the things which are in the power of others to <lb/>
            be your own, you will be hindered, you will lament, you <lb/>
            will be disturbed, you will blame both gods and men: <lb/>
            but if you think that only which is your own to be your <lb/>
            own, and if you think that what is another's, as it really <lb/>
            is, belongs to another, no man will ever compel you, no <lb/>
            man will hinder you, you will never blame any man, you <lb/>
            will accuse no man, you will do nothing involuntarily <lb/>
            (against your will), no man will harm you, you will have <lb/>
            no enemy, for you will not suffer any harm.</p>
          <p>If then you desire (aim at) such great things, remember <lb/>
            that you must not (attempt to) lay hold of them with a <lb/>
            small effort; but you must leave alone some things en­ <lb/>
            tirely, and postpone others for the present. But if you <lb/>
            wish for these things also (such great things), and power <note type="footnote"> 1 In Schweighæuser's edition the title is ‘ ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επικτήτου έγχειρίδιον</foreign>. <lb/>

            those former things (such great things): 1 certainly you <lb/>

            chiefly, whether it relates to the things which are in our <lb/>
            power or to things which are not in our power: and if it <lb/>
            relates to any thing which is not in our power, be ready to <lb/>

          <p>Remember that desire contains in it the profession (hope) <lb/>
            of obtaining that which you desire; and the profession <lb/>
            (hope) in aversion (turning from a thing) is that you will <lb/>
            not fall into that which you attempt to avoid: and he <lb/>
            who fails in his desire is unfortunate; and he who falls <lb/>
            into that which he would avoid, is unhappy. If then you <lb/>
            attempt to avoid only the things contrary to nature which <lb/>
            are within your power, you will not be involved in any of <lb/>
            the things which you would avoid. But if you attempt <lb/>
            to avoid disease or death or poverty, you will be unhappy. <lb/>
            Take away then aversion from all things which are not in <lb/>
            our power, and transfer it to the things contrary to nature <lb/>
            which are in our power. But destroy desire completely <lb/>
            for the present. For if you desire anything which is not <lb/>
            in our power, you must be unfortunate: but of the things <lb/>
            in our power, and which it would be good to desire, <lb/>
            nothing yet is before you. But employ only the power of <lb/>
            moving towards an object and retiring from it; and these <lb/>
            powers indeed only slightly and with exceptions and with <lb/>
            remission.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 This passage will be obscure in the original, unless it is examined <lb/>

            tion, notion); what is the nature of each thing, beginning <lb/>
            from the smallest ? If you love an earthen vessel, say it is <lb/>
            an earthen vessel which you love; for when it has been <lb/>
            broken, you will not be disturbed. If you are kissing <lb/>
            your child or wife, say that it is a human being whom <lb/>

          <p>When you are going to take in hand any act, remind <lb/>
            yourself what kind of an act it is. If you are going to <lb/>
            bathe, place before yourself what happens in the bath: <lb/>
            some splashing the water, others pushing against one <lb/>
            another, others abusing one another, and some stealing: <lb/>
            and thus with more safety you will undertake the matter, <lb/>
            if you say to yourself, I now intend to bathe, and to <lb/>
            maintain my will in a manner conformable to nature. <lb/>
            And so you will do in every act: for thus if any hindrance <lb/>
            to bathing shall happen, let this thought be ready: it was <lb/>
            not this only that I intended, but I intended also to <lb/>
            maintain my will in a way conformable to nature; but I <lb/>
            shall not maintain it so, if I am vexed at what happens.</p>

          <p>Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but <lb/>
            by the opinions about the things: for example, death is <lb/>
            nothing terrible, for if it were, it would have seemed so <lb/>
            to Socrates; for the opinion about death, that it is <lb/>
            terrible, is the terrible thing. When then we are impeded <lb/>
            or disturbed or grieved, let us never blame others, but <lb/>
            ourselves, that is, our opinions. It is the act of an ill­ <lb/>
            instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition; <lb/>
            it is the act of one who has begun to be instructed, to lay <lb/>
            the blame on himself; and of one whose instruction is <lb/>
            completed, neither to blame another, nor himself.</p>

          <p>As on a voyage when the vessel has reached a port, <lb/>

            to be constantly watching if the captain should call, and <lb/>
            then you must throw away all those things, that you may <lb/>

            should call, run to the ship, and leave all those things <lb/>
            without regard to them. But if you are old, do not even <lb/>

            spilled? Is a little wine stolen? Say on the occasion, <lb/>
            at such price is sold freedom from perturbation; at such <lb/>
            price is sold tranquillity, but nothing is got for nothing. <lb/>
            And when you call your slave, consider that it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible that he does not hear; and if he does hear, that <note type="footnote"> 1 He means, Do not chastise your slave while you are in a passion, <lb/>

            It will not have porticoes or baths through you.1 And <lb/>

            maker. But it is enough if every man fully discharges <lb/>

            those which follow it; and so proceed to the act. If you <lb/>
            do not, at first you will approach it with alacrity, without <lb/>
            having thought of the things which will follow; but <lb/>
            afterwards, when certain base (ugly) things have shewn <lb/>
            themselves, you will be ashamed. A man wishes to <lb/>
            conquer at the Olympic games. I also wish indeed, for it <note type="footnote"> 1 This passage is explained in the commentary of Simplicity, (xxxiv., <lb/>
            in Schweig.'s ed. xxvii. p. 264), and Schweighaeuser agrees with the­ <lb/>
            explanation, which is this: Nothing in the world (universe) can exist <lb/>
            or be done (happen) which in its proper sense, in itself and in its <lb/>
            nature is bad; for every thing is and is done by the wisdom and will <lb/>
            of God and for the purpose which he intended: but to miss a mark is <lb/>
            to fail in an intention; and as a man does not set up a mark, or does <lb/>
            not form a purpose for the purpose of missing the mark or the purpose, <lb/>
            so it is absurd (inconsistent) to say that God has a purpose or design, <lb/>
            and that he purposed or designed anything which in itself and in its <lb/>
            nature is bad. The commentary of Simplicius is worth reading. But <lb/>
            how many will read it ? Perhaps one in a million. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 ‘ Compare iii, 15, from which all this passage has been transferred <lb/>

            is a fine thing. But observe both the things which come <lb/>
            first, and the things which follow; and then begin the <lb/>
            act. You must do every thing according to rule, eat <lb/>
            according to strict orders, abstain from delicacies, exercise <lb/>
            yourself as you are bid at appointed times, in heat, in cold, <lb/>
            you must not drink cold water, nor wine as you choose; <lb/>
            in a word, you must deliver yourself up to the exercise <lb/>
            master as you do to the physician, and then proceed to <lb/>
            the contest. And sometimes you will strain the hand, <lb/>
            put the ankle out of joint, swallow much dust, sometimes <lb/>
            be flogged, and after all this be defeated. When you <lb/>
            have considered all this, if you still choose, go to the con­ <lb/>
            test : if you do not, you will behave like children, who at <lb/>
            one time play at wrestlers, another time as flute players, <lb/>
            again as gladiators, then as trumpeters, then as tragic <lb/>
            actors: so you also will be at one time an athlete, at <lb/>
            another a gladiator, then a rhetorician, then a philosopher, <lb/>
            but with your whole soul you will be nothing at all; but <lb/>
            like an ape you imitate every thing that you see, and one <lb/>
            thing after another pleases you. For you have not under­ <lb/>
            taken any thing with consideration, nor have you sur­ <lb/>
            veyed it well; but carelessly and with cold desire. Thus <lb/>
            some who have seen a philosopher and having heard one <lb/>
            speak, as Euphrates speaks,—and who can speak as he <lb/>
            does ?-they wish to be philosophers themselves also. My <lb/>
            man, first of all consider what kind of thing it is: and <lb/>
            then examine your own nature, if you are able to sustain <lb/>
            the character. Do you wish to be a pentathlete or a <lb/>
            wrestler? Look at your arms, your thighs, examine your <lb/>
            loins. For different men are formed by nature for different <lb/>
            things. Do you think that if you do these things, you <lb/>
            can eat in the same manner, drink in the same manner, <lb/>
            and in the same manner loathe certain things ? You must <lb/>
            pass sleepless nights, endure toil, go away from your <lb/>
            kinsmen, be despised by a slave, in every thing have the <lb/>
            inferior part, in honour, in office, in the courts of justice, <lb/>
            in every little matter. Consider these things, if you <lb/>
            would exchange for them, freedom from passions, liberty, <lb/>
            tranquillity. If not, take care that, like little children, <lb/>
            you be not now a philosopher, then a servant of the <lb/>
            publicani, then a rhetorician, then a procurator (manager) <lb/>
            for Caesar. These things are not consistent. You must <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            be one mail, either good or bad. You must either culti­ <lb/>
            vate your own ruling faculty, for external things; yow <lb/>
            must either exercise your skill on internal things or on <lb/>
            external things; that is you must either maintain the <lb/>
            position of a philosopher or that of a common person.</p>

          <p>As to piety towards the Gods you must know that this <lb/>
            is the chief thing, to have right opinions about them, to <lb/>
            think that they exist, and that they administer the, All <lb/>
            well and justly; and you must fix yourself in this prin­ <lb/>
            ciple (duty), to obey them, and to yield to them in every <lb/>
            thing which happens, and voluntarily to follow it as <lb/>
            being accomplished by the wisest intelligence. For if. <lb/>
            you do so, you will never either blame the Gods, nor will <lb/>
            you accuse them of neglecting you. And it is not possible <lb/>
            for this to be done in any other way than by withdraw­ <lb/>
            ing from the things which are not in our power, and by <lb/>
            placing the good and the evil only in those things which <lb/>
            are in our power. For if you think that any of the <lb/>
            things which are not in our power is good or bad, it is <lb/>
            absolutely necessary that, when you do not obtain what <lb/>
            you wish, and when you fall into those things which you <lb/>
            do not wish, you will find fault and hate those who are <lb/>

            the cause of them for every animal is formed by nature <lb/>
            to this, to fly from, and to turn from the things which <lb/>
            appear harmful and the things which are the cause of the <lb/>
            harm, but to follow and admire the things which are use­ <lb/>
            ful and the causes of the useful. It is impossible then <lb/>
            for a person who thinks that he is harmed to be delighted <lb/>
            with that which he thinks to be the cause of the <lb/>
            harm, as it is also impossible to be pleased with the harm <lb/>
            itself. For this reason also a father is reviled by his son, <lb/>
            when he gives no part to his son of the things which are <lb/>
            considered to be good: and it was this which made <lb/>
            Polynices and Eteocles 1 enemies, the opinion that royal <lb/>
            power was a good. It is for this reason that the cultivator <lb/>
            of the earth reviles the Gods, for this reason the sailor <lb/>
            does, and the merchant, and for this reason those who <lb/>
            lose their wives and their children. For where the use­ <lb/>
            ful (your interest) is, there also piety is.2 Consequently <lb/>
            he who takes care to desire as he ought and to avoid <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλίνειν</foreign>) as he ought, at the same time also cares after <lb/>
            piety. But to make libations and to sacrifice and to offer <lb/>
            first fruits according to the custom of our fathers, purely <lb/>
            and not meanly nor carelessly nor scantily nor above our <lb/>

            explain the sentence, which at first appears rather obscure. Perhaps <lb/>
            Arrian intends to say that the feeling of piety coincides with the <lb/>

            sopher. For if it is any of the things which are not in <lb/>
            our power, it is absolutely necessary that it must be <lb/>
            neither good nor bad. Do not then bring to the diviner <lb/>
            desire or aversion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔκκλισιν</foreign>) : if you do, you will approach <lb/>
            him with fear. But having determined in your mind that <lb/>
            every thing which shall turn out (result) is indifferent, <lb/>
            and does not concern you, and whatever it may be, for it <lb/>
            will be in your power to use it well, and no man will <lb/>
            hinder this, come then with confidence to the Gods as <lb/>
            your advisers. And then when any advice shall have <lb/>
            been given, remember whom you have taken as advisers, <lb/>
            and whom you will have neglected, if you do not obey <lb/>
            them. And go to divination, as Socrates said that you <lb/>
            ought, about those matters in which all the inquiry has <lb/>
            reference to the result, and in which means are not given <lb/>
            either by reason nor by any other art for knowing the <lb/>
            thing which is the subject of the inquiry. Wherefore <lb/>
            when we ought to share a friend's danger or that of our <lb/>
            country, you must not consult the diviner whether you <lb/>
            ought to share it. For even if the diviner shall tell you <lb/>
            that the signs of the victims are unlucky, it is plain that <lb/>
            this is a token of death or mutilation of part of the body <lb/>
            or of exile. But reason prevails that even with these <lb/>
            risks we should share the dangers of our friend and of <lb/>
            our country. Therefore attend to the greater diviner, the <lb/>
            Pythian God, who ejected from the temple him who did <lb/>
            not assist'his friend when he was being murdered.1</p>

            <title type="main">FRAGMENTS OF EPICTETUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THESE Fragments are entitled " Epicteti Fragmenta maxima <lb/>
            ex Ioanne Stobaeo, Antonio, et Maximo collecta" (ed. <lb/>
            Schweig.). There are some notes and emendations on the <lb/>
            Fragments; and a short dissertation on them by Schweig­ <lb/>
            haeuser.</p>
          <p>Nothing is known of Stobaeus nor of his time, except <lb/>
            the fact that he has preserved some extracts of an ethical <lb/>
            kind from the New Platonist Hierocles, who lived about <lb/>
            the middle of the fifth century A.D. ; and it is there­ <lb/>
            fore concluded that Stobaeus lived after Hicrocles. The <lb/>
            fragments attributed to Epictetus are preserved by Sto­ <lb/>
            baeus in his work entitled ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανθολόγιον</foreign>, or Florilegium or <lb/>
            Sermones.</p>
          <p>Antonins Monachus, a Greek monk, also made a Flori­ <lb/>
            legium, entitled Melissa (the bee). His date is uncer­ <lb/>
            tain, but it was certainly much later than the time of <lb/>
            Stobaeus.</p>
          <p>Maximus, also named the monk, and reverenced as a <lb/>
            saint, is said to have been a native of Constantinople, and <lb/>
            born about A.D. 580.</p>
          <p>Some of the Fragments contained in the edition of <lb/>
            Schweighaeuser are certainly not from Epictetus. Many <lb/>
            of the fragments are obscure; but they are translated as <lb/>
            accurately as I can translate them, and the reader must <lb/>
            give to them such meaning as he can.</p><pb n="406"/>

            much fodder, and much barley, and my bits are of gold <lb/>

            I think that it is not. Few persons have the talents and the character <lb/>
            which enable them to rise from a low condition; and the proper lessor <lb/>
            for them is to stay in the condition in which they are born and to be <lb/>
            content with it. Those who have the power of rising from a low <lb/>
            condition will rise whether they are advised to attempt it or not: and <lb/>
            generally they will not be able to rise without doing something useful <lb/>
            to society. Those who have ability sufficient to raise themselves from <lb/>
            a low estate, and at the same time to do it to the damage of society, <lb/>
            are perhaps only few, but certainly there are such persons. They rise <lb/>

            They gain wealth, they fill high places, they disturb society, they are <lb/>

            vered up to him by the people that he might punish him <lb/>

            him and making him a good man he brought him into the <lb/>
            theatre. When the Lacedaemonians expressed their sur­ <lb/>
            prise, Lycurgus said, I received from you this youth when <lb/>
            he was insolent and violent: I restore him to you gentle <lb/>

            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμοιομερω̂ν</foreign>) or of fire and earth ? for is it not enough to <lb/>
